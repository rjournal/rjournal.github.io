title: 'stellaR: A Package to Manage Stellar Evolution Tracks and Isochrones'
abstract: 'We present the R package stellaR, which is designed to access and manipulate
  publicly available stellar evolutionary tracks and isochrones from the Pisa low-mass
  database. The procedures for extracting important stages in the evolution of a star
  from the database, for constructing isochrones from stellar tracks and for interpolating
  among tracks are discussed and demonstrated. Due to the advance in the instrumentation,
  nowadays astronomers can deal with a huge amount of high-quality observational data.
  In the last decade impressive improvements of spectroscopic and photometric observational
  capabilities made available data which stimulated the research in the glob ular
  clusters field. The theoretical effort of recovering the evolutionary history of
  the clusters benefits from the computation of extensive databases of stellar tracks
  and isochrones, such as Pietrinferni et al. (2006); Dotter et al. (2008); Bertelli
  et al. (2008). We recently computed a large data set of stellar tracks and isochrones,
  “The Pisa low-mass database” (Dell’Omodarme et al., 2012), with up to date physical
  and chemical inputs, and made available all the calculations to the astrophysical
  community at the Centre de Données astronomiques de Strasbourg (CDS)1 , a data center
  dedicated to the collection and worldwide distribution of astronomical data. In
  most databases, the management of the information and the extraction of the relevant
  evolu tionary properties from libraries of tracks and/or isochrones is the responsibility
  of the end users. Due to its extensive capabilities of data manipulation and analysis,
  however, R is an ideal choice for these tasks. Nevertheless R is not yet well known
  in astrophysics; up to December 2012 only seven astronomical or astrophysical-oriented
  packages have been published on CRAN (see the CRAN Task View Chemometrics and Computational
  Physics). The package stellaR (Dell’Omodarme and Valle, 2012) is an effort to make
  available to the astro physical community a basic tool set with the following capabilities:
  retrieve the required calculations from CDS; plot the information in a suitable
  form; construct by interpolation tracks or isochrones of compositions different
  to the ones available in the database; construct isochrones for age not included
  in the database; extract relevant evolutionary points from tracks or isochrones.'
