title: 'orthoDr: Semiparametric Dimension Reduction via Orthogonality Constrained
  Optimization'
abstract: orthoDr is a package in R that solves dimension reduction problems using
  orthogonality constrained optimization approach. The package serves as a unified
  framework for many regression and survival analysis dimension reduction models that
  utilize semiparametric estimating equations. The main computational machinery of
  orthoDr is a first-order algorithm developed by Wen and Yin (2012) for optimization
  within the Stiefel manifold. We implement the algorithm through Rcpp and OpenMP
  for fast computation. In addition, we developed a general-purpose solver for such
  constrained problems with user-specified objective functions, which works as a drop-in
  version of optim(). The package also serves as a platform for future methodology
  developments along this line of work.
