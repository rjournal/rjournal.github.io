title: 'metaplus: An R Package for the Analysis of Robust Meta-Analysis and Meta-Regression'
abstract: 'The metaplus package is described with examples of its use for fitting
  meta-analysis and meta-regression. For either meta-analysis or meta-regression it
  is possible to fit one of three models: standard normal random effect, t-distribution
  random effect or mixture of normal random effects. The latter two models allow for
  robustness by allowing for a random effect distribution with heavier tails than
  the normal distribution, and for both robust models the presence of outliers may
  be tested using the parametric bootstrap. For the mixture of normal random effects
  model the outlier studies may be identified through their posterior probability
  of membership in the outlier component of the mixture. Plots allow the results of
  the different models to be compared. The package is demonstrated on three examples:
  a meta-analysis with no outliers, a meta-analysis with an outlier and a meta-regression
  with an outlier.'
