	Their econometric analysis indicates that stagnation and decline
	in real GDP, a high ratio of military expenditures to national income,
	a tradition of violent conflict, high income inequality, and slow
	growth in average food production are sources of emergencies. Also,
	inflation and low levels of IMF funding are associated with emergencies,

	Abstract = {The concern over outliers is old and undoubtedly dates back to the
	first attempt to base conclusions on a set of statistical data. Comments
	by Bernoulli (1777) indicate that the practice of discarding discordant
	observations was commonplace 200 years ago. The history of the treatment
	of such observations is traced from these early comments to the present.
	For simple normal samples, M estimators, L estimators, and Bayesian
	estimators are presented as techniques that accommodate outliers
	in estimation. For the study of concomitant variables, methods are
	given for the outright rejection of discordant observations. Rejection
	techniques for multiple outliers are reviewed, as are the effects
	of masking and swamping. Methods for the detection of outliers in
	a regression setting are given for various models. Influence functions
	in multiple regression are discussed and compared with both the classical
	and the Bayesian methods of outlier detection. Work on outliers in
	circular data, discriminant analysis, experimental design, multivariate
	data, generalized linear models, distributions other than normal,
	and time series is also reviewed.},

	Abstract = {Many questions remain about the causes and implications of state government
	reorganization. Using an original data set on agency consolidation
	in the states between 1950 and 1992, we show that executive branch
	restructuring occurs incrementally as well as through better recognized
	comprehensive reorganization. With continuous state-space modeling
	we show that these different reform paths are related and driven
	by distinct political and economic conditions. We also show that,
	contrary to previous findings, state attempts to alter their administrative
	organizations do impact long-term employment growth rates. Although
	smaller in magnitude, incremental as well as comprehensive reforms
	can enhance administrative efficiency. Further, unlike the Baumgartner
	and Jones (1993, 2002) punctuated-equilibrium model, we do not find
	evidence that incrementalism gives way to bursts of nonincremental
	change. Rather, incremental adjustments to the status quo may be
	sufficient to reduce the possibility the possibility of comprehensive
	reorganization at any point in the future.},

	efficiency is evaluated using a non-parametric method based on the

	input, output, and graph Farrell efficiency measures for a cross-section
	of all 589 Belgian municipalities. In a second stage of the analysis
	we explain the calculated differences in efficiency in terms of variables
	related to the structural characteristics of municipalities and to
	the institutional environment.},

	Abstract = {Procedures for rejecting outliers are essentially two stage, involving
	first an individual's judgment that a value in a given set of data
	is surprising, and then testing the surprising value for discordancy.
	The conventional frequency interpretation of the significance level
	for outlier tests is shown to be invalid and an experiment designed
	to investigate the inherent subjective nature of outlier procedures
	is described. This confirms that there are variations both between
	individuals in their reaction to surprising values and also between
	judgments made by the same individual on different occasions. The
	method of presentation of the data is shown to affect an individual's
	ability to perceive possible outliers. More surprising, it turns
	out that factors such as scale and pattern of the data are also very
	relevant.},

	Abstract = {We examine some of the consequences of financial globalization for
	democratization in emerging market economies by focusing on the currency
	markets of four Asian countries at different stages of democratic
	development. Using political data of various kinds-including a new
	events data series-and the Markov regime switching model from empirical
	macroeconomics, we show that in young and incipient democracies politics
	continuously causes changes in the probability of experiencing two
	different currency market equilibria: a high volatility "contagion"
	regime and a low volatility "fundamentals" regime. The kind of political
	events that affect currency market equilibration varies cross-nationally
	depending on the degree to which the polity of a country is democratic
	and its policymaking transparent. The results help us better gauge
	how and the extent to which democratization is compatible with financial
	globalization.},

@article{Jones:2003b,
	Abstract = {Political institutions translate inputs-in the form of changed preferences,
	new participants, new information, or sudden attention to previously
	available information-into policy outputs. In the process they impose
	costs on this translation, and these costs increase institutional
	friction. We argue that the "friction" in political institutions
	leads not to consistent "gridlock" but to long periods of stasis
	interspersed with dramatic policy punctuations. As political institutions
	add costs to the translation of inputs into outputs, institutional
	friction will increase, and outputs from the process will become
	increasingly punctuated overall. We use a stochastic process approach
	to compare the extent of punctuations among 15 data sets that assess
	change in U.S. government budgets, in a variety of aspects of the
	public policy process, in election results, and in stock market returns
	in the United States. We find that all of these distributions display
	positive kurtosis-tall central peaks (representing considerable stability)
	and heavy tails (reflecting the punctuations, both positive and negative).
	When we order institutions according to the costs they impose on
	collective action, those with higher decision and transaction costs
	generate more positive kurtosis. Direct parameter estimates indicate
	that all distributions except budget data were best fit by the double-exponential
	probability distribution; budgets are Paretian.},

@article{Koubi:2005,
	Abstract = {This article studies the consequences of inter- and intrastate wars
	for economic growth in a large cross-section of countries during
	the period 1960-89. It establishes that cross-country differences
	in economic growth are systematically related to the severity and
	duration of war. The combined prewar, contemporaneous, and postwar
	association between growth and war is negative; that is, economic
	performance has been lower in countries that fought a severe and/or
	prolonged war. However, the causal effect of war on postwar economic
	performance is positive. In particular, the longer or more severe
	the war, the higher the subsequent long-term rate of economic growth.
	A possible interpretation of these findings is that war is more likely
	to occur in poorly performing countries and/or to have a negative
	direct - contemporaneous - effect on growth. But in the longer term,
	war creates growth-enhancing possibilities. Interestingly, these
	effects arise mostly from civil wars and are quantitatively quite
	substantial. For instance, an increase in war duration by 10% leads
	to an increase of 2.1% in the average growth rate. The findings of
	this article are thus consistent with the predictions of the theories
	of both Organski & Kugler and Olson.},

	Abstract = {We construct a model of speculative trading to examine how the mean
	and volatility of stock prices is affected both by government partisanship
	and by traders' expectations of electoral victory by the right-wing
	or left-wing party. Our model predicts that rational expectations
	of higher inflation under left-wing administrations lowers the volume
	of stocks traded in the stock market. The decline in trading volume
	leads to a decrease in the mean and volatility of stock prices not
	only during the incumbency of left-wing governments, but also when
	traders expect the left-wing party to win elections. Conversely,
	expectation of lower inflation under right-wing administrations leads
	to higher trading volume. This leads to an increase in the mean and
	volatility of stock prices during the tenure of right-wing governments
	and when traders anticipate the right-wing party to win elections.
	Daily and monthly data from U.S. and British equity markets between
	1930 and 2000 statistically corroborate the predictions from our
	formal model.},

	value of a representative's committee seats and his or her loyalty
	in voting with party leaders in the immediate past. We further investigate
	whether the reelection costs of voting with party leaders-and against
	constituents-matters, compared to the value of committee seats. We
	first construct proxies for loyalty in voting, the re-election costs
	of party loyalty, and the value of members' committee assignments.
	We then estimate both continuous and discrete dependent variable
	models, controlling for leadership and tenure. Our results are twofold.
	First, we find a strong and positive relationship between loyalty
	and value of committee assignments. Second, we find a weaker, though
	still positive relationship between our measure of the electoral
	costs of loyalty and value of committee assignments. These results
	imply that there is some degree of signaling and/or exchange between
	party leaders and the rank-and-file membership to allocate parliamentary
	rights. We discuss some implications of these findings for theories
	of legislative organization and the legislator shirking literature.},

@article{Schneider:2006,
	Abstract = {This study analyzes changes from 1927 through 2003 in the use of incarceration
	by the American States, testing propositions derived from path dependency/punctuated
	equilibrium theory and from an extension of the social construction
	theory of policy design. The results suggest that incarceration changes
	often were path dependent, but that periods of equilibrium-type change
	with up and down adjustments also were relatively common until a
	critical juncture occurred in the late 1960s and early 1970s. The
	results also show that the states tended to change in the same direction,
	at the same time, as if some kind of national policy mood was important,
	even though incarceration rates are produced by state-level decisionmakers
	working in many different types of state and local institutional
	settings. The results confirm the proposition from the social construction
	theory of policy design that upward paths will be more common, last
	longer, more extreme, and harder to break than downward ones. Analysis
	of the public opinion variables most closely related to the social
	construction of law breakers indicates that small year-to-year changes
	were not very useful in explaining annual rates of incarceration
	change. On the other hand, a very rapid movement toward a more negative
	social construction may have been one of the factors important in
	triggering the critical juncture that occurred in all states. And,
	an exceptionally high and "sticky" negative construction of criminals
	extending for more than 30 years may be important in understanding
	the "stickiness" of institutions that produce incarceration rates.},

	Abstract = {The conceptualization and measurement of symbolic racism have been
	the subjects of a number of critiques, of which we address four:
	(1) we briefly review the history of its past conceptualization,
	which has been somewhat loose, and of its past measurement, which
	has been more consistent than often suggested. We then address three
	other critiques empirically. In each case the results support the
	original theory: (2) symbolic racism is an internally consistent
	belief system; it does have individual and structural variants, but
	they are highly correlated and have virtually identical effects on
	whites' racial policy preferences; (3) the effects of symbolic racism
	on whites' racial policy preferences are not artifacts of shared-item
	content with policy-attitude items (both conclusions are replicated
	in quite similar form in two surveys); and (4) symbolic racism is
	a distinctive belief system in its own right, encompassing a set
	of attitudes different from those in ideological conservatism, antiegalitarianism,
	individualism, and old-fashioned racism (a conclusion replicated
	in similar form in six surveys). Perhaps most importantly, the effects
	of symbolic racism on racial policy preferences are the same regardless
	of which conventional measure of symbolic racism is used.},

	application areas. Next we outline various approaches to estimation.
	We finish by briefly summarizing some recent research areas.},
