title: 'coxed: An R Package for Computing Duration-Based Quantities from the Cox Proportional
  Hazards Model'
abstract: The Cox proportional hazards model is one of the most frequently used estimators
  in duration (survival) analysis. Because it is estimated using only the observed
  durations’ rank ordering, typical quantities of interest used to communicate results
  of the Cox model come from the hazard function (e.g., hazard ratios or percentage
  changes in the hazard rate). These quantities are substantively vague and difficult
  for many audiences of research to understand. We introduce a suite of methods in
  the R package coxed to address these problems. The package allows researchers to
  calculate duration-based quantities from Cox model results, such as the expected
  duration (or survival time) given covariate values and marginal changes in duration
  for a specified change in a covariate. These duration-based quantities often match
  better with researchers’ substantive interests and are easily understood by most
  readers. We describe the methods and illustrate use of the package.
