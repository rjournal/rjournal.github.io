title: 'Residuals and Diagnostics for Binary and Ordinal Regression Models: An Introduction
  to the sure Package'
abstract: Residual diagnostics is an important topic in the classroom, but it is less
  often used in practice when the response is binary or ordinal. Part of the reason
  for this is that generalized models for discrete data, like cumulative link models
  and logistic regression, do not produce standard residuals that are easily interpreted
  as those in ordinary linear regression. In this paper, we introduce the R package
  ***sure***, which implements a recently developed idea of **SU**rrogate **RE**siduals.
  We demonstrate the utility of the package in detection of cumulative link model
  misspecification with respect to mean structures, link functions, heteroscedasticity,
  proportionality, and interaction effects.

# Introduction

Categorical outcomes are encountered frequently in practice across
different fields. For example, in medical studies, the outcome of
interest is often binary (e.g., presence or absence of a particular
disease after applying a treatment). In other studies, the outcome may
be an ordinal variable; that is, a categorical outcome having a natural
ordering. For instance, in an opinion poll, the response may be
satisfaction with categories low, medium, and high. In this case, the
response is ordered: low $<$ medium $<$ high.

Logistic and probit regression are popular choices for modeling a binary
outcome. Although this paper focuses on models for ordinal responses,
the surrogate approach to constructing residuals actually applies to a
wide class of general models of the form
$$\mathcal{Y} \sim F_a\left(y; \boldsymbol{X}, \boldsymbol{\beta}\right),$$
where $F_a\left(\cdot\right)$ is a discrete cumulative distribution
function, $\boldsymbol{X}$ is an $n \times p$ model matrix, and
$\boldsymbol{\beta}$ is a $p \times 1$ vector of unknown regression
coefficients. This functional form includes binary regression as a
special case. For example, the probit model has
$$\mathcal{Y} \sim Bernoulli\left[\Phi\left(\boldsymbol{X}^\top\boldsymbol{\beta}\right)\right],$$
where $\Phi\left(\cdot\right)$ is the cumulative distribution function
for the standard normal distribution.

The cumulative link model is a natural choice for modeling a binary or
ordinal outcome. Consider an ordinal categorical outcome $\mathcal{Y}$
with ordered categories $1 < 2 < \dots < J$. In a cumulative link model,
the cumulative probabilities are linked to the predictors according to
$$\label{eqn:clm}
  G^{-1}\left(\Pr\left\{\mathcal{Y} \le j\right\}\right) = \alpha_j + f\left(\boldsymbol{X}, \boldsymbol{\beta}\right),   (\#eq:eqnclm)$$
where $G\left(\cdot\right)$ is a continuous cumulative distribution
function, $\alpha_j$ are the category-specific intercepts,
$\boldsymbol{X}$ is a matrix of covariates, and $\boldsymbol{\beta}$ is
a vector of fixed regression coefficients. The intercept parameters
satisfy
$-\infty = \alpha_0 < \alpha_1 < \dots < \alpha_{J-1} < \alpha_J = \infty$.
We should point out that some authors (and software) use the alternate
formulation
$$\label{eqn:clm2}
  G^{-1}\left(\Pr\left\{\mathcal{Y} \ge j\right\}\right) = \alpha_j^\star + f\left(\boldsymbol{X}, \boldsymbol{\beta}^\star\right).   (\#eq:eqnclm2)$$
This formulation provides coefficients that are consistent with the
ordinary logistic regression model. The estimated coefficients from
model \@ref(eq:eqnclm2) will have the opposite sign as those in
model \@ref(eq:eqnclm); see, for example, @analysis-agresti-2010.

Another way to interpret the cumulative link model is through a latent
continuous random variable
$\mathcal{Z} = -f\left(\boldsymbol{X}, \boldsymbol{\beta}\right) + \epsilon$,
where $\epsilon$ is a continuous random variable with location parameter
$0$, scale parameter $1$, and cumulative distribution function
$G\left(\cdot\right)$. We then construct an ordered factor according to
the rule
$$y = j \quad if \quad \alpha_{j - 1} < z \le \alpha_j.$$
For $\epsilon \sim N\left(0, 1\right)$, this leads to the usual probit
model for ordinal responses,
$$\Pr\left\{\mathcal{Y} \le j\right\} = \Pr\left\{\mathcal{Z} \le \alpha_j\right\} = \Pr\left\{-f\left(\boldsymbol{X}, \boldsymbol{\beta}\right) + \epsilon \le \alpha_j\right\} = \Phi\left(\alpha_j + f\left(\boldsymbol{X}, \boldsymbol{\beta}\right)\right).$$
Common choices for the link function $G^{-1}\left(\cdot\right)$ and the
implied (standard) distribution for $\epsilon$ are described in
Table [1](#tab:common).

:::

There are a number of R packages that can be used to fit cumulative link
models \@ref(eq:eqnclm) and \@ref(eq:eqnclm2). The recommended package
[***MASS***](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=MASS) [@pkg-MASS]
contains the function `polr` (proportional odds logistic regression)
which, despite the name, can be used with all of the link functions
described in Table [1](#tab:common). The
[***VGAM***](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=VGAM) package
[@pkg-VGAM] has the `vglm` function for fitting vector generalized
linear models, which includes the broad class of cumulative link models.
By default, `vglm` uses the same parameterization as in
Equation \@ref(eq:eqnclm), but provides the option of using the
parameterization seen in Equation \@ref(eq:eqnclm2); this will result in
the estimated coefficients having the opposite sign. Package
[***ordinal***](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=ordinal)
[@pkg-ordinal] has the `clm` function for fitting cumulative link
models. The popular [***rms***](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=rms)
package [@pkg-rms] has two functions: `lrm` for fitting logistic
regression and cumulative link models using the logit link, and `orm`
for fitting ordinal regression models. Both of these functions use the
parameterization seen in Equation \@ref(eq:eqnclm2).

The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. In the next section,
we discuss the idea of surrogate residuals [@residuals-liu-2017] and
talk about some important properties. Next, we briefly discuss
jittering, bootstrapping, and how they apply to the surrogate approach.
The Section "[3](#sec:sure)" introduces the ***sure*** package and
discusses the various modeling packages it supports. The sections
following demonstrate how ***sure*** can be used to detect misspecified
mean structures, heteroscedasticity, misspecified link functions, and
interaction effects, as well as check the proportionality assumption.
The Section "[4](#sec:wine)" provides a real data analysis example. We
end with a closing summary.

# Surrogate residuals {#sec:surrogate}

For a continuous outcome $\mathcal{Y}$, the residual is traditionally
defined as the difference between the observed and fitted values. For
ordinal outcomes, the residuals are more difficult to define, and few
definitions have been proposed in the literature. @graphical-liu-2009
propose using the cumulative sums of residuals derived from collapsing
the ordered categories into multiple binary outcomes. Unfortunately,
this method leads to multiple residuals for the ordinal outcome and
therefore is difficult to interpret. @residuals-li-2012 show that the
sign-based statistic (SBS)
$$\label{eqn:pres}
  R_{SBS} = E\left\{sign\left(y - \mathcal{Y}\right)\right\} = Pr\left\{y > \mathcal{Y}\right\} - Pr\left\{y < \mathcal{Y}\right\}   (\#eq:eqnpres)$$
can be used as a residual for ordinal outcomes. Though
@residuals-li-2012 refer to these as probability-based residuals, we
will follow @residuals-liu-2017 and refer to them as SBS residuals. For
an overview of the theoretical and graphical properties of the SBS
residual \@ref(eq:eqnpres), see @residuals-liu-2017 and the
[***PResiduals***](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=PResiduals)
package [@pkg-PResiduals]. A limitation with the SBS residuals is that
they are based on a discrete outcome and are discrete themselves, which
makes them less useful in diagnostic plots.

@residuals-liu-2017 propose a new type of residual that is based on a
continuous variable $S$ that acts as a surrogate for the ordinal outcome
$\mathcal{Y}$. This surrogate residual is defined as
$$\label{eqn:sure}
R_S = S - E\left(S | \boldsymbol{X}\right),   (\#eq:eqnsure)$$
where $S$ is a continuous variable based on the conditional distribution
of the latent variable $\mathcal{Z}$ given $\mathcal{Y}$. In particular,
given $\mathcal{Y} = y$, @residuals-liu-2017 show that $S$ follows a
truncated distribution obtained by truncating the distribution of
$\mathcal{Z} = -f\left(\boldsymbol{X}, \boldsymbol{\beta}\right) + \epsilon$
using the interval $\left(\alpha_{y - 1}, \alpha_y\right)$. The benefit
of the surrogate residual \@ref(eq:eqnsure) is that it is based on a
continuous variable $S$, such that $R_S$ is also continuous.

Furthermore, it can be shown [@residuals-liu-2017] that if the
hypothesized model agrees with the true model, then $R_S$ will have the
following properties:

1.  **symmetry around zero** $E\left(R_S | \boldsymbol{X}\right) = 0$;

2.  **homogeneity** $Var\left(R_S | \boldsymbol{X}\right) = c$, a
    constant that is independent of $\boldsymbol{X}$;

3.  **reference distribution** the empirical distribution of $R_S$
    approximates an explicit distribution that is related to the link
    function $G^{-1}\left(\cdot\right)$. In particular, independent of
    $\boldsymbol{X}$, $R_S \sim G\left(c + \int udG(u)\right)$, where
    $c$ is a constant.

According to property (a), if $\int u dG\left(u\right) = 0$, then
$R_S \sim G\left(\cdot\right)$. Properties (a)--(c) allow for a thorough
examination of the residuals to check model adequacy and
misspecification of the mean structure and link function.

## Jittering for general models {#sec:jitter}

The latent method discussed in Section "[2](#sec:surrogate)" applies to
cumulative link models for ordinal outcomes. For more general models, we
can define a surrogate using a technique called jittering. Suppose the
true model for an ordinal outcome $\mathcal{Y}$ is
$$\mathcal{Y} \sim F_a\left(y; \boldsymbol{X}, \boldsymbol{\beta}\right),$$
where $F\left(\cdot\right)$ is a discrete cumulative distribution
function. This model is general enough to cover the cumulative link
models \@ref(eq:eqnclm) and \@ref(eq:eqnclm2), and nearly any parametric
or nonparametric model for ordinal outcomes.

@residuals-liu-2017 suggest defining the surrogate $S$ using either of
the following two approaches:

1.  jittering on the outcome scale:
    $S | \mathcal{Y} = y \sim \mathcal{U}\left[y, y + 1\right]$;

2.  jittering on the probability scale:
    $S | \mathcal{Y} = y \sim \mathcal{U}\left[F_a\left(y - 1\right), F_a\left(y\right)\right]$.

Once a surrogate is obtained, we define the surrogate residuals in the
same way as Equation \@ref(eq:eqnsure). In either case, if the
hypothesized model is correct, then symmetry around zero still holds;
that is $E\left(R_S | \boldsymbol{X}\right) =
0$. For the latter case, if the hypothesized model is correct then
$R_S | \boldsymbol{X} \sim \mathcal{U}\left(-1/2, 1/2\right)$. In other
words, jittering on the probability scale has the additional property
that the conditional distribution of $R_S$ given $\boldsymbol{X}$ has an
explicit form which allows for a full examination of the distributional
information of the residual.

## Bootstrapping {#sec:boot}

Since the surrogate residuals are based on random sampling, additional
variability is introduced. One way to account for this sample
variability and help stabilize any patterns in diagnostic plots is to
use the bootstrap [@efron-another-1979].

The procedure for bootstrapping surrogate residuals is similar to the
model-based bootstrap algorithm used in linear regression. To obtain the
$b$-th bootstrap replicate of the residuals, @residuals-liu-2017 suggest
the following algorithm:

Step 1

:   Perform a standard case-wise bootstrap of the original data to
    obtain the bootstrap sample
    $\left\{\left(\boldsymbol{X}_{1b}^\star, \mathcal{Y}_{1b}^\star\right), \dots, \left(\boldsymbol{X}_{ nk}^\star, \mathcal{Y}_{nk}^\star\right)\right\}$.

Step 2

:   Using the procedure outlined in the previous section, obtain a
    sample of surrogate residuals
    $R_{S_{1b}}^\star, \dots, R_{S_{nb}}^\star$ using the bootstrap
    sample obtained in **Step 1**.

This procedure is repeated a total of $B$ times. For
residual-vs-covariate (i.e., $R$-vs-$x$) plots and residual-vs-fitted
value (i.e.,
$R$-vs-$f\left(\boldsymbol{X}, \widehat{\boldsymbol{\beta}}\right)$)
plots, we simply scatter all $B \times n$ residuals on the same plot.
This approach is valid since the bootstrap samples are drawn
independently. For large data sets, we find it useful to lower the
opacity of the data points to help alleviate any issues with
overplotting. For Q-Q plots, on the other hand, @residuals-liu-2017
suggest using the median of the $B$ bootstrap distributions, which is
the implementation used in the
[***sure***](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=sure) package
[@pkg-sure].

# Surrogate residuals in R {#sec:sure}

cumulative link and other types of models. The supported packages and
their corresponding functions are described in Table [2](#tab:pkgs).

  cumulative link models. Note: by default, `vglm` uses the same
  parameterization as in Equation \@ref(eq:eqnclm). This can be reversed
  by setting `reverse = TRUE` in the `family` argument.
:::

The ***sure*** package currently exports four functions:

-   `resids`---for constructing surrogate residuals;

-   `surrogate`---for generating the surrogate response values used in
    the residuals;

-   `autoplot`---for producing various diagnostic plots using
    [***ggplot2***](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=ggplot2) graphics
    [@pkg-ggplot2];

-   `gof`---for simulating $p$-values from various goodness-of-fit
    tests.

In addition, the package also includes five simulated data sets: `df1`,
`df2`, `df3`, `df4`, and `df5`. These data sets are used throughout the
paper to demonstrate how the surrogate residual can be useful as a
diagnostic tool for cumulative link models. The R code used to generate
these data sets is available on the projects GitHub page:
<https://github.com/koalaverse/sure/blob/master/data-raw/data.R>.

## Detecting a misspecified mean structure {#sec:mean}

For illustration, the data frame `df1` contains $n = 2000$ observations
from the following cumulative link model:
$$\label{eqn:quadratic}
  Pr\left\{\mathcal{Y} \le j\right\} = \Phi\left(\alpha_j + \beta_1 X + \beta_2 X ^ 2\right), \quad j = 1, 2, 3, 4,   (\#eq:eqnquadratic)$$
where $\alpha_1 = -16$, $\alpha_2 = -12$, $\alpha_3 = -8$,
$\beta_1 = -8$, $\beta_2 = 1$, and
$X \sim \mathcal{U}\left(1, 7\right)$. These parameters were chosen to
ensure that 1) the sample from the latent variable $\mathcal{Z}$ is
spread out, rather than clustering in a small interval, and 2) each
category of $\mathcal{Y}$ is well represented in the sample; we follow
these guidelines throughout the simulated examples. The simulated data
for this example are available in the `df1` data frame from the
***sure*** package and are loaded automatically with the package; see
`?df1` for details. Below, we fit a (correctly specified) probit model
using the `polr` function from the ***MASS*** package.

``` r
# Fit a cumulative link model with probit link
library(sure)  # for residual function and sample data sets
library(MASS)  # for polr function
fit.polr <- polr(y ~ x + I(x ^ 2), data = df1, method = "probit")
```

The code chunk below obtains the SBS residuals \@ref(eq:eqnpres) from
the previously fitted probit model `fit.polr` using the ***PResiduals***
package and constructs a couple of diagnostic plots. The results are
displayed in Figure [1](#fig:quadratic-correct-sbs).

``` r
# Obtain the SBS/probability-scale residuals
library(PResiduals)
pres <- presid(fit.polr)

# Residual-vs-covariate plot and Q-Q plot
library(ggplot2)  # for plotting
p1 <- ggplot(data.frame(x = df1$x, y = pres), aes(x, y)) +
  geom_point(color = "#444444", shape = 19, size = 2, alpha = 0.5) +
  geom_smooth(color = "red", se = FALSE) +
  ylab("Probability-scale residual")
p2 <- ggplot(data.frame(y = pres), aes(sample = y)) +
  stat_qq(distribution = qunif, dparams = list(min = -1, max = 1), alpha = 0.5) +
  xlab("Sample quantile") +
  ylab("Theoretical quantile")
grid.arrange(p1, p2, ncol = 2)  # Figure 1
```

(Note: the reference distribution for the SBS residual is the
$\mathcal{U}\left(-1, 1\right)$ distribution.) As can be seen in the
left side of Figure [1](#fig:quadratic-correct-sbs), the SBS residuals
are inherently discrete and often display unusual patterns in diagnostic
plots, making them less useful as a diagnostic tool.

![Figure 1: SBS residual plots for the (correctly specified) probit
model fit to the `df1` data set. *Left*: Residual-vs-covariate plot with
a nonparametric smooth (red curve). *Right*: Q-Q plot of the
residuals.](quadratic-correct-sbs.png){#fig:quadratic-correct-sbs
width="100%" alt="graphic without alt text"}

Similarly, we can use the `resids` function in package ***sure*** to
obtain the surrogate residuals discussed in
Section "[2](#sec:surrogate)." This is illustrated in the following code
chunk; the results are displayed in
Figure [2](#fig:quadratic-correct-surrogate). (Note: since the surrogate
residuals are based on random sampling, we specify the seed via the
`set.seed` function throughout this paper for reproducibility.)

``` r
# Obtain surrogate residuals
library(sure)
set.seed(101)  # for reproducibility
sres <- resids(fit.polr)

# Residual-vs-covariate plot and Q-Q plot
library(ggplot2)  # needed for autoplot function
p1 <- autoplot(sres, what = "covariate", x = df1$x, xlab = "x")
p2 <- autoplot(sres, what = "qq", distribution = qnorm)
grid.arrange(p1, p2, ncol = 2)  # Figure 2
```

![Figure 2: Surrogate residual plots for the (correctly specified)
probit model fit to the `df1` data set. *Left*: Residual-vs-covariate
plot with a nonparametric smooth (red curve). *Right*: Q-Q plot of the
residuals.](quadratic-correct-surrogate.png){#fig:quadratic-correct-surrogate
width="100%" alt="graphic without alt text"}

The ***sure*** package also includes `autoplot` methods for the various
classes of models listed in Table [2](#tab:pkgs), so that the user can
give `autoplot` the fitted model directly. The benefit of this approach
is that the fitted values and reference distribution (used in Q-Q plots)
are automatically extracted. For example, to reproduce the Q-Q plot in
Figure [2](#fig:quadratic-correct-surrogate), we could have used the
following:

``` r
set.seed(101)  # for reproducibility
autoplot(fit.polr, what = "qq")  # same as top right of Figure 1
```

Suppose that we did not include the quadratic term in our fitted model.
We would expect a residual-vs-$x$ plot to indicate that such a quadratic
term is missing. Below, we update the previously fitted model by
removing the quadratic term, then update the residual-vs-covariate plots
(code not shown). The updated residual plots are displayed in
Figure [3](#fig:quadratic).

``` r
fit.polr <- update(fit.polr, y ~ x)  # remove quadratic term
```

The SBS residuals gives some indication of a misspecified mean
structure, but this only becomes more clear with increasing $J$, and the
plot is still discrete. This is overcome by the surrogate residuals
which produces a residual plot not unlike those seen in ordinary linear
regression models.

## Detecting heteroscedasticty {#sec:hetero}

One issue that often raises concerns in statistical inference is that of
heteroscedasticity; that is, when the error term has non constant
variance. Heteroscedasticity can bias the statistical inference and lead
to improper standard errors, confidence intervals, and $p$-values.
Therefore, it is imperative to identify heteroscedasticity whenever
present and take appropriate action (e.g., transformations). In ordinary
linear regression, this topic has been covered extensively. Not much has
been proposed in the literature for categorical models.

As discussed in Section "[2](#sec:surrogate)," one of the properties of
the surrogate residual $R_S$ is that, if the model is specified
correctly, then $Var\left(R_S | X\right) = c$, where $c$ is a constant.

For this example, we generated $n = 2000$ observations from the
following ordered probit model:
$$Pr\left\{\mathcal{Y} \le j\right\} = \Phi\left\{\left(\alpha_j + \beta X\right) / \sigma_X\right\}, \quad j = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5,$$
where $\alpha_1 = -36$, $\alpha_2 = -6$, $\alpha_3 = 34$,
$\alpha_4 = 64$, $\beta = -4$, $X \sim \mathcal{U}\left(2, 7\right)$,
and $\sigma_X = X ^ 2$. Notice how the variability is an increasing
function of $X$. These data are available in the `df2` data frame loaded
with the ***sure*** package; see `?df2` for details.

The following block of code uses the `orm` function from the popular
***rms*** package to fit a probit model to the simulated data. Note: we
set `x = TRUE` in the call to `orm` in order to use the `presid`
function later.

``` r
# Fit a cumulative link model with probit link
library(rms)  # for orm function
fit.orm <- orm(y ~ x, data = df2, family = "probit", x = TRUE)
```

If heteroscedasticity is present, we would expect this to show up in
various diagnostic plots, such as a residual-vs-covariate plot. Below we
obtain the SBS and surrogate residuals as before and plot them against
$X$. The results are displayed in Figure [4](#fig:heteroscedasticity).

``` r

In Figure [4](#fig:heteroscedasticity), it is clear from the plot of the
surrogate residuals (left side of Figure [4](#fig:heteroscedasticity))
that the variance increases with $X$, a sign of heteroscedasticity. As a
matter of fact, the plot suggests that the true link function has a
varying scale parameter, $\sigma = \sigma\left(\boldsymbol{X}\right)$.
The plot of the SBS residuals (right side of
Figure [4](#fig:heteroscedasticity)), on the other hand, gives no
indication of an issue with nonconstant variance.

As outlined in Section "[2.1](#sec:jitter)," the jittering technique is
broadly applicable to virtually all parametric and nonparametric models
for ordinal responses. To illustrate, the code chunk below uses the
***VGAM*** package to fit a vector generalized additive model to the
same data using a nonparametric smooth for $x$.

``` r
library(VGAM)  # for vgam and vglm functions
fit.vgam <- vgam(y ~ s(x), family = cumulative(link = probit, parallel = TRUE),
                 data = df2)
```

To obtain a surrogate residual using the jittering technique, we can set
`method = "jitter"` in the call to `resids` or `autoplot`. There is also
the option `jitter.scale` which can be set to either `"probability"`,
for jittering on the probability scale (the default), or `"response"`,
for jittering on the response scale. In the code chunk below, we use the
`autoplot` function to obtain residual-by-covariate plots using both
types of jittering. The results (Figure [5](#fig:heteroscedasticity2))
indicate that the variance increases with increasing $x$.

``` r
set.seed(103)  # for reproducibility
p1 <- autoplot(fit.vgam, what = "covariate", x = df2$x, method = "jitter",
               xlab = "x")
p2 <- autoplot(fit.vgam, what = "covariate", x = df2$x, method = "jitter",
               jitter.scale = "response", xlab = "x")
grid.arrange(p1, p2, ncol = 2)  # Figure 5
```

## Detecting a misspecified link function {#sec:link}

For this example, we simulated $n = 2000$ observations from the
following model
$$Pr\left(\mathcal{Y} \le j\right) = G\left(\alpha_j - 8 X + X ^ 2\right), \quad j = 1, 2, 3, 4,$$
where $G\left(\cdot\right)$ is the CDF for the Gumbel (max) distribution
(see Table [1](#tab:common)), $\alpha_1 = -16$, $\alpha_2 = -12$,
$\alpha_3 = -8$, $\beta_1 = -8$, $\beta_2 = 1$, and
$X \sim \mathcal{U}\left(1, 7\right)$. The data are available in the
data frame `df3` within the package; see `?df3` for details.

We fit a model with various link functions, where the true link function
is log-log. From these output, we construct Q-Q plots of the residuals
using $R = 100$ bootstrap replicates. The results are displayed in
Figure [6](#fig:link).

``` r
# Fit models with various link functions to the simulated data
fit.probit <- polr(y ~ x + I(x ^ 2), data = df3, method = "probit")
fit.logistic <- polr(y ~ x + I(x ^ 2), data = df3, method = "logistic")
fit.loglog <- polr(y ~ x + I(x ^ 2), data = df3, method = "loglog")  # correct link
fit.cloglog <- polr(y ~ x + I(x ^ 2), data = df3, method = "cloglog")

# Construct Q-Q plots of the surrogate residuals for each model
set.seed(1056)  # for reproducibility
p1 <- autoplot(fit.probit, nsim = 100, what = "qq")
p2 <- autoplot(fit.logistic, nsim = 100, what = "qq")
p3 <- autoplot(fit.loglog, nsim = 100, what = "qq")
p4 <-  autoplot(fit.cloglog, nsim = 100, what = "qq")

# Figure 6
grid.arrange(p1, p2, p3, p4, ncol = 2)  # bottom left plot is correct model
```

From the Q-Q plots in Figure [6](#fig:link), it is clear the the model
with the log-log link (which corresponds to Gumbel (max) errors in the
latent variable formulation) is the most appropriate, while the other
plots indicate deviations from the hypothesized model.

![Figure 6: Q-Q plots of the residuals for various cumulative link
models fit to simulated data with Gumbel (max) errors. *Top left*: A
model with probit link. *Top right*: A model with logit link. *Bottom
left*: A model with log-log link (i.e., the correct model). *Bottom
right*: A model with complementary log-log link.](link.png){#fig:link
width="100%" alt="graphic without alt text"}

Alternatively, we could also use the surrogate residuals to make use of
existing distance-based goodness-of-fit (GOF) tests; for example, the
Kolmogorov-Smirnov distance. The `gof` function in ***sure*** can be
used to produce simulated $p$-values from such tests.

Currently, the `gof` function supports three goodness-of-fit tests: the
Kolmogorov-Smirnov test (`test = "ks"`), the Anderson-Darling test
(`test = "ad"`), and the Cramer-Von Mises test (`test = "cvm"`). Below,
we use the `gof` function to simulate $p$-values from the
Anderson-Darling test for each of the four models; we also set `nsim` to
100 to produce smoother plots and reduce the sampling error induced by
the surrogate procedure. The `plot` method is then used to display the
empirical distribution function (EDF) of the simulated $p$-values. A
good fit would imply uniformly distributed $p$-values; hence, the EDF
would be relatively straight with a slope of one. The results in
Figure [7](#fig:gof) agree with the Q-Q plots from Figure [6](#fig:link)
in that the log-log link is the most appropriate for these data. (Note:
the plotting method for `"gof"` objects uses base R graphics; hence, we
can use the `par` function to set various graphical parameters.)

``` r
# Figure 7
par(mfrow = c(2, 2), mar = c(2, 4, 2, 2) + 0.1)
set.seed(8491)  # for reproducibility
plot(gof(fit.probit, nsim = 100, test = "ad"), main = "")
plot(gof(fit.logistic, nsim = 100, test = "ad"), main = "")
plot(gof(fit.loglog, nsim = 100, test = "ad"), main = "")
plot(gof(fit.cloglog, nsim = 100, test = "ad"), main = "")
```

## Checking the proportionality assumption {#sec:prop}

An important feature of the cumulative link model \@ref(eq:eqnclm) is
the proportional odds assumption, which assumes that the mean structure,
$f\left(\boldsymbol{X}, \boldsymbol{\beta}\right)$, remains the same for
each of the $J$ categories; for the logit case (see row one of
Table [1](#tab:common)), this is also referred to as the proportional
odds assumption. @regression-harrell-2001 [pp. 334--335] suggests
computing each observation's contribution to the first derivative of the
log likelihood function with respect to $\boldsymbol{\beta}$, averaging
them within each of the $J$ categories, and examining any trends in the
residual plots, but these plots can be difficult to interpret.
Fortunately, it is relatively straightforward to use the simulated
surrogate response values $S$ to check the proportionality assumption.

To illustrate, we generated 2000 observations from each of the following
probit models
$$Pr\left(\mathcal{Y} \le j\right) = \Phi\left(\alpha_j + \beta_1 X\right), \quad j = 1, 2, 3, \quad \textrm{and} \quad Pr\left(\mathcal{Y} \le j\right) = \Phi\left(\alpha_j + \beta_2 X\right), \quad j = 4, 5, 6,$$
where $\alpha_1 = -1.5$, $\alpha_2 = 0$, $\alpha_3 = 1$, $\alpha_4 = 3$,
$\beta_1 = 1$, $\beta_2 = 1.5$, and
$X \sim \mathcal{U}\left(-3, 3\right)$. The data are available in the
data frame `df4` within the package; see `?df4` for details.

Checking the proportionality assumption here amounts to checking whether
or not $\beta_1 - \beta_2 = 0$. As outlined in @residuals-liu-2017, we
can generate surrogates $S_1 \sim \mathcal{N}\left(-\beta_1 X, 1\right)$
and $S_2 \sim \mathcal{N}\left(-\beta_2 X, 1\right)$, both conditional
on $X$. We then define the difference $D = S_2 - S_1$ which, conditional
on $X$, follows a
$\mathcal{N}\left(\left(\beta_1 - \beta_2\right) X, 1\right)$
distribution. If $\beta_1 - \beta_2 = 0$, then $D$ should be independent
of $X$. This can be easily checked by plotting $D$ against $X$. Below,
we use the `surrogate` function to generate the surrogate response
values directly (as opposed to the residuals) and generate the
$D$-vs-$X$ plot shown in Figure [8](#fig:proportionality).

``` r
# Fit separate models (VGAM should already be loaded)
fit1 <- vglm(y ~ x, data = df4[1:2000, ],
             cumulative(link = probit, parallel = TRUE))
fit2 <- update(fit1, data = df4[2001:4000, ])

# Generate surrogate response values
set.seed(8671)  # for reproducibility
s1 <- surrogate(fit1)
s2 <- surrogate(fit2)

# Figure 8
ggplot(data.frame(D = s1 - s2, x = df4[1:2000, ]$x) , aes(x = x, y = D)) +
  geom_point(color = "#444444", shape = 19, size = 2) +
  geom_smooth(se = FALSE, size = 1.2, color = "red")
```

From Figure [8](#fig:proportionality), it is clear that
$\beta_1 - \beta_2 \ne 0$; hence, the proportionality assumption does
not hold.

## Detecting interaction effects {#sec:int}

A common challenge in model building is determining whether or not there
are important interactions between the predictors in the data. Using the
surrogate residuals, it is rather straightforward to determine if such
an interaction effect is missing from the assumed model.

For illustration, we generated $n = 2000$ observations from the
following ordered probit model
$$Pr\left(\mathcal{Y} \le j\right) = \Phi\left(\alpha_j + \beta_1 x_1 + \beta_2 x_2 + \beta_3 x_1 x_2\right), \quad j = 1, 2, 3, 4,$$
where $\alpha_1 = -16$, $\alpha_2 = -12$, $\alpha_3 = -8$,
$\beta_1 = -5$, $\beta_2 = 3$, $\beta_3 = 10$,
$x_1 \sim \mathcal{U}\left(1, 7\right)$, and $x_2$ is a factor with
levels `Treatment` and `Control`. The simulated data are available in
the `df5` data frame loaded with the ***sure*** package; see `?df5` for
details. Below, we fit two probit models using the `clm` function from
the ***ordinal*** package. The first model corresponds to the simulated
control group, while the second model corresponds to the treatment
group.

``` r
library(ordinal)  # for clm function
fit1 <- clm(y ~ x1, data = df5[df5$x2 == "Control", ], link = "probit")
fit2 <- clm(y ~ x1, data = df5[df5$x2 == "Treatment", ], link = "probit")
```

If the true model contains an interaction term $x_1 x_2$ but the fitted
model does not include it, we can detect this misspecification using the
surrogate residuals. We simply plot $R_S$ versus $x_1$ for the treatment
group, and compare it to the plot of $R_S$ versus $x_1$ for the
controls---or better yet, we can just use the surrogate response $S$
instead of $R_S$. The trends in these two plots should be different.
Below, we use `ggplot` along with the `sure` function to construct such
a plot in Figure [9](#fig:interaction). The plot indicates a negative
association between $x_1$ and the outcome within the control group, and
a positive association between $x_1$ and the treatment group (i.e., an
interaction between $x_1$ and $x_2$).

``` r
# Figure 9
set.seed(1105)  # for reproducibility
df5$s <- c(surrogate(fit1), surrogate(fit2))  # surrogate response values
ggplot(df5, aes(x = x1, y = s)) +
  geom_point(color = "#444444", shape = 19, size = 2, alpha = 0.5) +
  geom_smooth(se = FALSE, size = 1.2, color = "red2") +
  facet_wrap( ~ x2) +
  ylab("Surrogate response") +
  xlab(expression(x[1]))
```

# Bitterness of wine {#sec:wine}

@randal-analysis-1989 performed an experiment on factors determining the
bitterness of wine. Two binary treatment factors, temperature and
contact (between juice and skin), were controlled while crushing the
grapes during wine production. Nine judges each assessed wine from two
bottles from each of the four treatment conditions; for a total of
$n = 72$. The response is an ordered factor with levels
$1 < 2 < 3 < 4 < 5$. The data are available in the ***ordinal***
package; see ?`ordinal::wine` for details.

``` r
data(wine, package = "ordinal")  # load wine data set
wine.clm <- clm(rating ~ temp + contact, data = wine, link = "probit")
```

Since both of the covariates in this model are binary factors,
scatterplots are not appropriate for displaying the
residual-by-covariate relationships. Instead, the `autoplot` function in
`sure` uses boxplots; a future release is likely to include the
additional option for producing nonparametric densities for each level
of a factor. The code chunk below uses `autoplot` along with
`grid.arrange` to produce some standard residual diagnostic plots. The
results are displayed in Figure [10](#fig:wine). The Q-Q plot and
residual-vs-fitted value plot do not indicate any serious model
misspecifications. Furthermore, the boxplots reveal that the medians of
the surrogate residuals are very close to zero, and the distribution of
the residuals within each level appear to be symmetric and have
approximately the same variability (with the exception of a few
outliers).

``` r
set.seed(1225)  # for reproducibility
grid.arrange(  # Figure 10
  autoplot(wine.clm, nsim = 10, what = "qq"),
  autoplot(wine.clm, nsim = 10, what = "fitted", alpha = 0.5),
  autoplot(wine.clm, nsim = 10, what = "covariate", x = wine$temp,
           xlab = "Temperature"),
  autoplot(wine.clm, nsim = 10, what = "covariate", x = wine$contact,
           xlab = "Contact"),
  ncol = 2
)
```

# Summary {#sec:summary}

In this paper, we introduce the ***sure*** package, which implements the
surrogate approach to residuals for ordinal regression models described
in @residuals-liu-2017. Using simulated data sets, we illustrate the
various properties of these residuals and how they can be used to check
assumptions in the ordinal regression model (e.g., heteroscedasticity,
misspecified link functions, etc.) using continuous residuals which
produce diagnostic plots not unlike those seen in ordinary linear
regression. This offers a new way of performing typical diagnostic
checks for ordinal regression models that are easily interpreted by the
analyst. Furthermore, this new approach to constructing residuals for
ordinal regression models is still under active development and new
functionality will be added to ***sure*** in the future.
