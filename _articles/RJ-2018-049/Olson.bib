Journal = {{Annals of Applied Statistics}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{8}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{649-673}},
Abstract = {{How will the climate system respond to anthropogenic forcings? One
   approach to this question relies on climate model projections. Current
   climate projections are considerably uncertain. Characterizing and, if
   possible, reducing this uncertainty is an area of ongoing research. We
   consider the problem of making projections of the North Atlantic
   meridional overturning circulation (AMOC). Uncertainties about climate
   model parameters play a key role in uncertainties in AMOC projections.
   When the observational data and the climate model output are
   high-dimensional spatial data sets, the data are typically aggregated
   due to computational constraints. The effects of aggregation are unclear
   because statistically rigorous approaches for model parameter inference
   have been infeasible for high-resolution data. Here we develop a
   flexible and computationally efficient approach using principal
   components and basis expansions to study the effect of spatial data
   aggregation on parametric and projection uncertainties. Our Bayesian
   reduced-dimensional calibration approach allows us to study the effect
   of complicated error structures and data-model discrepancies on our
   ability to learn about climate model parameters from high-dimensional
   data. Considering high-dimensional spatial observations reduces the
   effect of deep uncertainty associated with prior specifications for the
   data-model discrepancy. Also, using the unaggregated data results in
   sharper projections based on our climate model. Our computationally
   efficient approach may be widely applicable to a variety of
   high-dimensional computer model calibration problems.}},

   with uncertainties}},
Journal = {{Geoscientific Model Development}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{7}},
Number = {{5}},
Pages = {{1933-1943}},
Abstract = {{Computer models of ice sheet behavior are important tools for projecting
   future sea level rise. The simulated modern ice sheets generated by
   these models differ markedly as input parameters are varied. To ensure
   accurate ice sheet mass loss projections, these parameters must be
   constrained using observational data. Which model parameter combinations
   make sense, given observations? Our method assigns probabilities to
   parameter combinations based on how well the model reproduces the
   Greenland Ice Sheet profile. We improve on the previous state of the art
   by accounting for spatial information and by carefully sampling the full
   range of realistic parameter combinations, using statistically rigorous
   methods. Specifically, we estimate the joint posterior probability
   density function of model parameters using Gaussian process-based
   emulation and calibration. This method is an important step toward
   calibrated probabilistic projections of ice sheet contributions to sea
   level rise, in that it uses data-model fusion to learn about parameter
   values. This information can, in turn, be used to make projections while
   taking into account various sources of uncertainty, including parametric
   uncertainty, data-model discrepancy, and spatial correlation in the
   error structure. We demonstrate the utility of our method using a
   perfect model experiment, which shows that many different parameter
   combinations can generate similar modern ice sheet profiles. This result
   suggests that the large divergence of projections from different ice
   sheet models is partly due to parametric uncertainty. Moreover, our
   method enables insight into ice sheet processes represented by parameter
   interactions in the model.}},

Abstract = {{Steady-state and transient climate-change computations are performed
   with the author's three-dimensional polythermal ice sheet model
   Simulation Code for Polythermal Ice Sheets for the Greenland Ice Sheet.
   The distinctive feature of this model is the detailed consideration of
   the basal temperate ice layer, in which the water content and its impact
   on the ice viscosity are computed; its transition surface to the cold
   ice region is accounted for by continuum-mechanical jump conditions on
   this interface. The simulations presented include steady states subject
   to a range of physical parameters and two different climates (present
   and glacial conditions), as well as three types of transient scenarios,
   namely (i) sinusoidal Milankovic-period forcing, (ii) paleoclimatic
   forcing from the Greenland Ice Core Project core reconstruction, and
   (iii) future greenhouse warming forcing.}},

Journal = {{Annals of Glaciology}},
Year = {{2011}},

Abstract = {{SeaRISE (Sea-level Response to Ice Sheet Evolution) is a US-led
   multi-model community effort to predict the likely range of the
   contribution of the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets to sea-level rise
   over the next few hundred years under global warming conditions. The
   Japanese ice-sheet modelling community is contributing to SeaRISE with
   two large-scale, dynamic/thermodynamic models: SICOPOLIS and IcIES. Here
   we discuss results for the Greenland ice sheet, obtained using both
   models under the forcings (surface temperature and precipitation
   scenarios) defined by the SeaRISE effort. A crucial point for meaningful
   simulations into the future is to obtain initial conditions that are
   close to the observed state of the present-day ice sheet. This is
   achieved by proper tuning during model spin-up from the last
   glacial/interglacial cycle to today. Experiments over 500 years indicate
   that both models are more sensitive (exhibit a larger rate of ice-sheet
   mass loss) to future climate warming (based on the A1B emission
   scenario) than to a doubling in the basal sliding speed. Ice-sheet mass
   loss varies between the two models by a factor of similar to 2 for
   sliding experiments and a factor of similar to 3 for climate-warming
   experiments, highlighting the importance of improved constraints on the
   parameterization of basal sliding and surface mass balance in ice-sheet
   models.}},
