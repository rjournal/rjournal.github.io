title: 'Stilt: Easy Emulation of Time Series AR(1) Computer Model Output in Multidimensional
  Parameter Space'
abstract: Statistically approximating or “emulating” time series model output in parameter
  space is a common problem in climate science and other fields. There are many packages
  for spatio-temporal modeling. However, they often lack focus on time series, and
  exhibit statistical complexity. Here, we present the R package stilt designed for
  simplified AR(1) time series Gaussian process emulation, and provide examples relevant
  to climate modelling. Notably absent is Markov chain Monte Carlo estimation – a
  challenging concept to many scientists. We keep the number of user choices to a
  minimum. Hence, the package can be useful pedagogically, while still applicable
  to real life emulation problems. We provide functions for emulator cross-validation,
  empirical coverage, prediction, as well as response surface plotting. While the
  examples focus on climate model emulation, the emulator is general and can be also
  used for kriging spatio-temporal data.
