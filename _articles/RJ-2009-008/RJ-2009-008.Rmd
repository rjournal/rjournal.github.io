title: Facets of R
abstract: We are seeing today a widespread, and welcome, tendency for non-computer-specialists
  among statisticians and others to write collections of R functions that organize
  and communicate their work. Along with the flood of software sometimes comes an
  attitude that one need only learn, or teach, a sort of basic how-to-write-the-function
  level of R programming, beyond which most of the detail is unimportant or can be
  absorbed without much discussion. As delusions go, this one is not very objectionable
  if it encourages participation. Nevertheless, a delusion it is. In fact, functions
  are only one of a variety of important facets that R has acquired by intent or circumstance
  during the three-plus decades of the history of the software and of its predecessor
  S. To create valuable and trustworthy software using R often requires an understanding
  of some of these facets and their interrelations. This paper identifies six facets,
  discussing where they came from, how they support or conflict with each other, and
  what implications they have for the future of programming with R.
