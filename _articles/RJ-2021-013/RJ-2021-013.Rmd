title: 'AQuadtree: an R Package for Quadtree Anonymization of Point Data'
abstract: The demand for precise data for analytical purposes grows rapidly among
  the research community and decision makers as more geographic information is being
  collected. Laws protecting data privacy are being enforced to prevent data disclosure.
  Statistical institutes and agencies need methods to preserve confidentiality while
  maintaining accuracy when disclosing geographic data. In this paper we present the
  AQuadtree package, a software intended to produce and deal with official spatial
  data making data privacy and accuracy compatible. The lack of specific methods in
  *R* to anonymize spatial data motivated the development of this package, providing
  an automatic aggregation tool to anonymize point data. We propose a methodology
  based on hierarchical geographic data structures to create a varying size grid adapted
  to local area population densities. This article gives insights and hints for implementation
  and usage. We hope this new tool may be helpful for statistical offices and users
  of official spatial data.
