title: Automating Reproducible, Collaborative Clinical Trial Document Generation with
  the listdown Package
abstract: The conveyance of clinical trial explorations and analysis results from
  a statistician to a clinical investigator is a critical component of the drug development
  and clinical research cycle. Automating the process of generating documents for
  data descriptions, summaries, exploration, and analysis allows the statistician
  to provide a more comprehensive view of the information captured by a clinical trial,
  and efficient generation of these documents allows the statistican to focus more
  on the conceptual development of a trial or trial analysis and less on the implementation
  of the summaries and results on which decisions are made. This paper explores the
  use of the listdown package for automating reproducible documents in clinical trials
  that facilitate the collaboration between statisticians and clinicians as well as
  defining an analysis pipeline for document generation.
