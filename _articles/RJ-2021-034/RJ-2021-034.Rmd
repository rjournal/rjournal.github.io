title: Statistical Quality Control with the qcr Package
abstract: ' The R package [qcr](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=qcr) for Statistical
  Quality Control (SQC) is introduced and described. It includes a comprehensive set
  of univariate and multivariate SQC tools that completes and increases the SQC techniques
  available in R. Apart from integrating different R packages devoted to SQC ([qcc](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=qcc),
  [MSQC](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=MSQC)), [qcr](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=qcr)
  provides nonparametric tools that are highly useful when Gaussian assumption is
  not met. This package computes standard univariate control charts for individual
  measurements, $\bar{x}$, $S$, $R$, $p$, $np$, $c$, $u$, EWMA, and CUSUM. In addition,
  it includes functions to perform multivariate control charts such as Hotelling T$^2$,
  MEWMA and MCUSUM. As representative features, multivariate nonparametric alternatives
  based on data depth are implemented in this package: $r$, $Q$ and $S$ control charts.
  The [qcr](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=qcr) library also estimates the most
  complete set of capability indices from first to the fourth generation, covering
  the nonparametric alternatives, and performing the corresponding capability analysis
  graphical outputs, including the process capability plots. Moreover, Phase I and
  II control charts for functional data are included. '
