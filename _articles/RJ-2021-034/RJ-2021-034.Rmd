# Introduction {#sec:intro}

Throughout the last decades, there has been an increasing interest to
measure, improve, and control the quality of products, services, and
procedures. This is connected to the strong relationship between
quality, productivity, prestige, trust, and brand image. In fact,
implementing procedures of statistical quality control (SQC) is
currently related to increasing companies' competitiveness.\
The concept of quality control has been extended from the first
definitions based on the idea of adjusting production to a standard
model to satisfy customer requirements and include all participants.
Nowadays, SQC is not only applied to manufactured products but to all
industrial and service processes.

![Statistical tools applied in each steps of the Six Sigma
methodology.](DEMAIC.PDF){#DMAIC width="1\\linewidth"}

The use of different SQC techniques was standardized With the
development of the Six Sigma method by Motorola in 1997 [@pande2000six].
Six Sigma is a methodology or even philosophy focused on variability
reduction that promotes the use of statistical methods and tools in
order to improve processes in industry and services. The Six Sigma
application is composed of five stages: Define, Measure, Analyze,
Improve, and Control (DEMAIC). Figure [1](#DMAIC){reference-type="ref"
reference="DMAIC"} shows some representative statistical techniques
applied in each of the Six Sigma stages. The two most representative
statistical tools of SQC are the control charts and the process
capability analysis [@montgomery2009introduction]. Therefore, the
proposed [qcr](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=qcr) package has been
developed in order to provide users a comprehensive and free set of
programming tools to apply control charts and perform capability
analysis in the SQC framework.\
The control stage is characterized by the use of tools based on anomaly
detection and correction [@montgomery2009introduction]. The most
representative techniques of this stage and the primary tool of the
Statistical Process Control (SPC) are the control charts
[@champ1987exact]. They have been developed to evaluate the process
performance and at any time. The use of control charts prevents the
process from getting out of control, and helping to detect the
assignable causes corresponding to variations of the critical-to-quality
features (CTQs), thus performing process changes when actually required.
Furthermore, control charts provide estimates of the natural range of
process variation (natural control limits), allowing us to compare this
range with those limits specified by standards, company managers, or
customers (specification limits). Hence, the process monitoring can be
carried out by comparing each new observation with these natural limits,
preventing defects in the final product. Briefly, a control chart is a
two-dimensional graph whose axis represents the variable or attribute
that is being monitored (CTQ variables). The estimation of natural
control limits of the CTQ variables is developed by a process composed
of two phases: In Phase I, the natural control limits are estimated
using a preliminary sample (calibration sample) where we assume that the
causes of variation are only random. In Phase II, each new observation
is plotted on the control chart along with the natural limits obtained
in the previous step. The set of new observations (twhich are not used
to calculate the natural control limits) make up the so-called
monitoring sample. Patterns, observations of out of control limits, runs
of more than six observations on one side of the central line, among
others, are some of the different criteria to identify out of control
states in a specific process, providing also valuable information about
the detection of any assignable causes of variation in the monitoring.\

![Control charts implemented in the
[qcr](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=qcr)
package.](graficos2.PDF){#types width="1\\linewidth"}

The most used control charts are based on the assumptions of normality
and independence of the studied CTQ variables. These charts are used to
control the position and dispersion of CTQ attributes and variables.
Figure [2](#types){reference-type="ref" reference="types"} shows some of
the most important types of control charts. These can be classified
according to the type of feature that is being controlled (attribute or
variable), the variable dimension (univariate or multivariate), and
assuming or not a parametric distribution of the variable (parametric or
nonparametric). The [qcr](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=qcr)
package provides charts for the mean ($\bar{x}$), standard deviation
($s$), range ($R$), individual measurements ($I$), moving ranges ($MR$),
proportion of nonconforming units ($p$), number of nonconforming units
($np$), number of defects per unit ($c$), mean number of defects per
control unit ($u$), exponentially weighted moving average (EWMA), and
cumulative sum control chart (CUSUM). The last two techniques are also
called memory control charts, and they are specially designed to detect
shifts of less than two standard deviations, both when using rational
samples or individual measurements. On the other hand, new control
charts based on the concept of data depth and developed by
[@liu1995control] are implemented in
[qcr](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=qcr). Those are the $r$, $Q$,
and $S$ control charts, the nonparametric alternatives for individual
measurements, mean control chart, and CUSUM control chart, respectively.
When more than one variable defines the process quality, multivariate
control charts are applied. If the Gaussian assumption is met, the
Hotelling T$^2$ control chart can be applied. If we want to detect small
deviations, multivariate EWMA (MEWMA) and multivariate CUSUM (MCUSUM)
can be implemented. When no parametric distribution is assumed, $r$,
$Q$, and $S$ charts can be used.\
Another interesting SQC tool, which is very useful in the industry, is
the Process Capability Analysis (PCA). It estimates how well a process
meets the tolerances defined by the company, customers, standards, etc.,
by comparing the specification tolerances with respect to the natural
range of variation of CTQ features. The capability of the process is
measured using capability indicators. Process Capability Ratio (PCR) is
a numerical score that helps the manufacturers know whether the output
of a process meets the engineering specifications. Large PCR values show
that the industrial or service process is capable of meeting the
customer requirements. There have been many different PCRs developed in
the last four decades that require the Gaussian assumption for the CTQ
variable [@boyles1991taguchi]. However, many processes in industry and
real applications do not meet this hypothesis. Thus, we could
innacuratelly estimate the capability using PCR. Hence, many authors
have studied different nonparametric alternatives to traditional PCR
[@polansky2007process].\
The [qcr](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=qcr) package has been
developed in R [@R] under the GNU license. Nowadays, there are other R
packages that currently provide quality control tools for users. The use
of each one is shown in Figure [3](#packages){reference-type="ref"
reference="packages"}.\
The [qcc](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=qcc) package
[@scrucca2004qcc] was developed by Professor Luca Scrucca of the
Department of Economics, Finance, and Statistics at the University of
Perugia. It enables us to perform Shewhart quality control charts for
variables and attributes, as well as the CUSUM and EWMA charts for
detecting small changes in the CTQ variable. Multivariate analysis is
performed applying the Hotelling T$^2$ control chart. Additionally, it
has functions implemented to obtain the operating characteristic curves
(OC) and to estimate process capability analysis indices. Pareto and
Ishikawa diagrams are also implemented. Otherwise, the
[IQCC](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=IQCC) package
[@recchia2010iqcc] is maintained by Professor Emanuel P. Barbosa of the
Institute of Mathematics in the State University of Campinas. It has a
smaller number of control charts implemented, but it incorporates
multivariate graphics. The qualityTools package [@roth2012qualitytools]
was developed to aid learning in quality sciences.
Figure [3](#packages){reference-type="ref" reference="packages"} shows
some of its utilities, e.g., capability analysis (providing a
comprehensive set of parametric distributions) and design of
experiments. In addition, the
[SixSigma](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=SixSigma) library
[@cano2017sixsigma; @cano2017sixsigma2] provides alternative functions
to qualityTools and [qcc](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=qcc)
packages and the possibility of implementing process maps.\

![Comparison between the main packages in R devoted to Statistical
Quality Control and the [qcr](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=qcr)
package.](packages.PDF){#packages width="0.80\\linewidth"}

Furthermore, there are other libraries specifically focused on control
chart applications. Namely, the
[spcadjust](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=spcadjust) [@spcadjust]
that allows us to estimate the calibration control limits of Shewhart,
CUSUM, and EWMA control charts, and the
[spc](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=spc) [@spc] which provides
tools for the evaluation of EWMA, CUSUM, and Shiryaev-Roberts control
charts by using Average Run Length and RL quantiles criteria. Moreover,
the [MSQC](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=MSQC) package
[@santos2016package] is a set of tools for multivariate process control,
mainly control charts. It contains the main alternatives for
multivariate control charts such as Hotelling (T$^2$), Chi-squared,
MEWMA, MCUSUM, and Generalized Variance control charts. It also includes
some tools to evaluate the multivariate normal assumption. The
corresponding multivariate capability analysis can be performed using
the [MPCI](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=MPCI) library [@MPCI] that
provides different multivariate capability indices. It is also
interesting to mention the
[edcc](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=edcc) package [@edcc] for its
economic design of control charts by minimizing the expected cost per
hour of the studied process.

It is important to emphasize that the
[qcr](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=qcr) package also includes new
applications such as nonparametric approaches of control charts and
capability indices (also covering the capability plots), which are
currently unavailable in the R software.

# Datasets in the qcr package {#sec:datsets}

The [qcr](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=qcr) package contains new
databases (see table [\[datasets\]](#datasets){reference-type="ref"
reference="datasets"}) based on study cases tackled by the authors
during their professional activity as well as well-known datasets
implemented on other packages focused on statistical quality control
such as:

-   **archery1:** It consists of a stage in which the archer shoots 72
    arrows. The information is given in x and y coordinates. It is
    implemented in the [MSQC](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=MSQC)
    package (@santos2016package).

-   **circuit:** Number of nonconformities observed in 26 successive
    samples of 100 printed circuit boards. It is implemented in the
    [qcc](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=qcc) package
    (@scrucca2004qcc).

-   **dowel1:** Diameter and length of a dowel pin. It is implemented in
    the [MSQC](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=MSQC) package
    (@santos2016package).

-   **orangejuice:** Frozen concentrated orange juice is packed in 6-oz
    cartons. These cartons are formed on a machine by spinning them from
    a cardboard stock and attaching a metal bottom panel. A can is then
    inspected to determine whether, when filled, the liquid could
    possibly leak either on the side seam or around the bottom joint. If
    this occurs, a can is considered nonconforming. The data were
    collected as 30 samples of 50 cans each at half-hour intervals over
    a three-shift period in which the machine was in continuous
    operation. It is implemented in the
    [qcc](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=qcc) package
    (@scrucca2004qcc).

-   **pcmanufact:** A personal computer manufacturer counts the number
    of nonconformities per unit on the final assembly line. He collects
    data on 20 samples of 5 computers each. It is implemented in the
    [qcc](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=qcc) package
    (@scrucca2004qcc).

-   **pistonrings:** Piston rings for an automotive engine are produced
    by a forging process. The inside diameter of the rings manufactured
    by the process is measured on 25 samples, each of size 5, drawn from
    a process being considered 'in control'. It is implemented in the
    [qcc](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=qcc) package
    (@scrucca2004qcc).

# Univariate and multivariate parametric control charts in qcr

The construction of a control chart is equivalent to the plotting of the
acceptance regions of a sequence of hypothesis tests over time. Namely,
the $\bar{x}$ chart is a control chart used to monitor the process mean
$\mu$. It plots the sample means, $\bar{X}$'s, corresponding to
subgroups of the $\{X_1,X_2,...\}$ observations and is equivalent to
test the hypotheses $H_0:\mu=\mu_0$ versus $H_{\alpha}:\mu \neq \mu_0$
(for some target value $\mu_0$) conducted over time, using $\bar{x}$ as
the test statistic. Here we assume that $\{X_1,X_2,...\}$ are the sample
measurements of a particular CTQ feature that follows the $F$
distribution with mean $\mu$ and standard deviation $\sigma$. When there
is insufficient evidence to reject $H_0$, we can state that the process
is under control; otherwise, the process is out of control. In other
words, processes are under control when their sources of variation are
only the sources common to the process [@brown1990statistical]. The
decision to reject or not $H_0$ is based on the value of the sample mean
$\bar{x}$ observed at each time interval [@liu1996control]. The control
charts are easy to construct, visualize, and interpret, and most
important, have proven their effectiveness in practice since the 1920's.

Control charts are defined, on the one hand, by a center line that
represents the average value of the CTQ feature corresponding to the
in-control state and, on the other hand, two horizontal lines, called
the upper control limit (UCL) and the lower control limit (LCL). The
region between the control limits corresponds to the region where $H_0$
is not rejected (defined in the previous section). As a consequence, the
process will be out of control when an observed rational sample or an
individual measurement falls outside the limits. Let $w$ be a sample
statistic that measures a quality characteristic of interest, and
suppose that the mean of $w$ is $\mu_w$ and the standard deviation of
$w$ is $\sigma_w$. Then the center line, the upper control limit, and
the lower control limit become: $$\mbox{UCL}=\mu_w + L \sigma_w$$
$$\mbox{CL}=\mu_w$$ $$\mbox{LCL}=\mu_w - L \sigma_w,$$ where $L$ is the
"distance" of the control limits from the center line, expressed in
standard deviation units.\
When several random variables characterize the quality of a
process/service, applying statistical multivariate quality control
techniques becomes necessary. In fact, if we analyze each variable
separately, the probability that an observation of a variable will fall
within the calculated limits when it is known that the process is
actually under control will no longer be 0.9973 for $6\sigma$ amplitude.
Assuming independence, it will be $0.9973^p$, where $p$ is the number of
CTQ features, while the probability of type I will actually lead to
$\alpha'=1-(1-\alpha)^p$. Therefore, the control limits are different
from those drawn, assuming the control of each CTQ variable
independently from the others. Moreover, if the variables are dependent,
the calculation of $\alpha$ becomes more complex. This subject is
particularly important today, as automatic inspection procedures make it
customary to measure many parameters of each product over time. The more
common multivariate parametric control charts are the Hotelling T$^2$
(to identify big shifts) and the multivariate CUSUM (MCUSUM) and EWMA
(MEWMA) for identifying small shifts.

The functions that compute the quality control statistics for the
different univariate control charts (involving continuous, attribute or
count data) are shown in Table [\[shew\]](#shew){reference-type="ref"
reference="shew"}. For the sake of simplicity and taking into account
that these types of control charts are implemented in other packages,
the use of these functions is not shown in this work. More details are
given in the help of [qcr](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=qcr)
package [@flores2016qualityreview].

# Nonparametric control charts based on data depth

The control charts presented in this section were proposed by
[@liu1995control] as an alternative to those described in previous
section. The main idea of its control graphs is to reduce each
multivariate measure to the univariate index, that is, its relative
center-exterior classification induced by a depth of data. This approach
is completely nonparametric, and therefore, these control charts are not
defined by any parametric assumption regarding the process model. Thus,
they are applicable in a wider number of case studies than those
counterparts such as $T^2$, MCUSUM, and MEWMA control charts. In
addition, these graphs allow the simultaneous detection of the change of
location (shift of the mean) and the increase of the scale (change in
variability) in a process.

[@liu1995control] proposed and justified three types of control charts,
the $r$, $Q$, and $S$ charts which can be considered as data-depth-based
multivariate generalizations of the univariate $X$, $\bar{x}$, and CUSUM
charts, respectively.

## Data depth

In multivariate analysis, the term depth refers to the degree of
centrality of a point regarding a data cloud or a probability
distribution. Therefore, it is possible to define a rank in the
multidimensional Euclidean space through the calculation of observation
depth. According to [@dyckerhoff2004data] and @cascos2011data, the depth
function can be defined as a bounded function
$D_{p}:R^{d} \longrightarrow R$, with $P$ the distribution set in $R^d$,
that assigns at each point of $R^d$ its degree of centrality with
respect to $P$. Depth functions with which control charts can be
performed are the

-   Simplicial depth (@liu1990notion),

-   Mahalanobis depth (@mahalanobis1936generalised),

-   Halfspace or Tukey depth (@tukey1975mathematics),

-   Likelihood depth (@fraiman1997multivariate), and

-   Random projection depth (@zuo2000general).

## Statistics derived from data depth

Let $G$ a $k$-dimensional distribution, and let $Y_1,\dots,Y_m$ be $m$
random observations from $G$. The sample $Y_1, \dots , Y_m$ is generally
the reference sample of a CTQ variable in the context of quality
control, composed of measurements from products obtained by an under
control process. If $X_1, X_2, \dots$ are the new observations from the
manufacturing process, assuming that the different $X_i$ values follow
an $F$ distribution if the quality of the studied product has been
deteriorated or, in other words, if the process is out of control.
Otherwise, they follow a $G$ distribution. Let $D_G(\cdot)$ denote a
notion of depth, and assume that $G$ and $F$ are two continuous
distributions. Thus, if all the $D_G(Y_i)$ values are sorted in
increasing order, and $Y_{[j]}$ denotes the sample value associated with
the $j$th smallest depth value, then
$Y_{\left[ 1\right]},\ldots,Y_{\left[ m\right]}$ are the order
statistics of $Y_i$'s, with $Y_{[m]}$ being the most central point.
Therefore, the smaller the order (or the rank) of a point, the farther
that point will be from the underlying distribution $G(\cdot)$.

@liu1995control defines the rank statistic as
$$r_{G}\left( y\right)= P\left\lbrace D_{G}\left( Y\right) \leq D_{G}\left( y\right) \mid Y\sim G \right\rbrace$$
whereby $Y \sim G$ indicates that the random variable $Y$ follows the
distribution $G$. When $G$ is unknown, the empirical distribution
$G_{m}$ of the sample $\{Y_1, \ldots, Y_m\}$ can be used instead, and
the statistic is defined by
$$r_{G_{m}}\left( y\right)= \frac{ \# \left\lbrace D_{G_{m}}\left( Y_j\right) \leq D_{G_{m}}\left( y\right), j = 1,\ldots,m \right\rbrace}{m}$$
In the same way that $r_{G}$ and $r_{G_{m}}$, the $Q$ statistics can be
also defined as follows

$$Q\left( G,F\right)= P\left\lbrace D_{G}\left( Y\right) \leq D_{G}\left( X\right) \mid Y\sim G, X\sim F \right\rbrace=E_{F}\left[ r_{G}\left( X\right) \right]$$

$$Q\left( G,F_{n}\right)= \frac{1}{n} \sum _{i=1}^{n} r_{G}\left( X_i\right)$$

$$Q\left( G_{m},F_{n}\right)= \frac{1}{n} \sum _{i=1}^{n} r_{G_{m}}\left( X_i\right),$$

whereby $F_n(\cdot)$ denotes the empirical distribution of the sample
$\{X_1, \dots , X_n\}$. The control charts corresponding to these
statistics can be developed as described in the following sections.

## The $r$ chart

Calculate
$\left\lbrace r_{G}\left( X_1\right),r_{G}\left( X_2\right),\ldots,r_{G}\left( X_n\right)\right\rbrace$
or
$\left\lbrace r_{G_{m}}\left( X_1\right),r_{G_{m}}\left( X_2\right),\ldots,r_{G_{m}}\left( X_n\right)\right\rbrace$
if $G$ is unknown but $Y_1,\ldots,Y_m$ are available. As a result, the
$r$ chart consists of plotting the rank statistic in regard to time. The
control chart central line is CL = $0.5$, whereas the lower limit is LCL
=$\alpha$, with $\alpha$ accounting for the false alarm rate. The
process will be out of control if $r_G(\cdot)$ falls under LCL. A small
value of the rank statistic $r_{Gm}(X)$ means that only a very small
proportion of $Y_i$ values are more outlying than $X$. Therefore,
assuming that $X \sim F$, then a small value of $r_{Gm}(X)$ suggests a
possible deviation from $G$ to $F$. This may be due to a shifting in the
location and/or an increase in the scale of the studied CTQ variable.
Taking into account that the UCL is not defined for the $r$ chart, the
CL line serves as a reference to identify emerging patterns, runs, or
trends. If $r_{Gm}(X)$ is greater than 0.5, there is evidence of scale
decreasing, and also could take place a negligible location shift. This
case should be tackled as an improvement in quality given a gain in the
accuracy, and thus the process should not be considered as out of
control.

## The $Q$ chart

The idea behind the $Q$ chart is similar to the one behind the $\bar{x}$
chart. If $X_1, X_2, \dots$ are univariate and $G$ is a normal
distribution, the $\bar{x}$ chart plots the averages of consecutive
subsets of the different $X_i$. A goal of this type of chart is that it
can prevent the identification of a false alarm when the process is
actually in control (even when some individual sample points fall out of
control limits due to random fluctuations).\
The $Q$ chart is the nonparametric alternative to the $\bar{x}$ chart.
It is performed by plotting the averages of consecutive subsets of size
$n$ corresponding to the rank statistic ($r_G(X_i)$ or $r_{Gm}(X_i)$),
given by $Q\left( G,F_{n}^j\right)$ or $Q\left( G_{m},F_{n}^j\right)$,
whereas $F_n^j$ is the empirical distribution of the $X_i$'s in the
$j$th subset, $j =1, 2, \dots$. Accordingly, if only
$\left\lbrace Y_1, Y_2,\ldots, Y_m \right\rbrace$ are available, the $Q$
chart plots the sequence
$\left\lbrace Q\left( G_{m},F_{n}^j\right),Q\left( G_{m},F_{n}^j\right),\ldots\right\rbrace$.\
Depending on the value of $n$, the corresponding control limits are as
follows:

-   If $n \geq 5$, $CL = 0.5$ and

    -   $LCL = 0.5-Z_{\alpha}\left( 12n\right)^{\frac{1}{2}}$ for
        $Q\left( G,F_{n}^j\right)$.

    -   $LCL = 0.5-Z_{\alpha}\sqrt{\frac{1}{12}\left(\frac{1}{m}+\frac{1}{n}\right)}$
        for $Q\left( G_m,F_{n}^j\right)$.

-   If $n < 5$, $CL = 0.5$ and
    $LCL = \frac{\left( n!\alpha\right)^{\frac{1}{n}}}{n}$.

## The $S$ control chart

The $S$ control chart is based on the CUSUM univariate control chart,
which is basically the plot of $\sum_{i=1}^{n}\left( X - \mu \right)$,
which reflects the pattern of the total deviation from the expected
value. As mentioned above, it is more effective than the $X$ chart or
the $\bar{x}$ chart in detecting small process changes. The
nonparametric CUSUM chart based on data depth suggests plotting $S_n(G)$
and $S_n(G_m)$, defined by
$$S_n\left( G\right) = \sum_{i=1}^{n}\left( r_G\left( X_i\right)  - \frac{1}{2} \right)$$
with control limits $CL = 0$ and
$LCL = -Z_{\alpha}\left(\frac{n}{12}\right)^{\frac{1}{2}}$ and
$$S_n\left( G_m\right) = \sum_{i=1}^{n}\left( r_{G_{m}}\left( X_i\right)  - \frac{1}{2} \right).$$
If only $Y_1, \dots Y_m$ are available, the control limits are $CL = 0$
and
$LCL = -Z_{\alpha}\sqrt{n^2\frac{\left(\frac{1}{m}+\frac{1}{n}\right)}{12}}$.
The LCL control limits in both cases constitute a curve instead of a
straight line; if $n$ is large, the control chart $S$ should be
standardized as follows:
$$S_n^{*}\left( G\right) = \frac{S_n^{*}\left(G\right)}{\sqrt{\frac{n}{12}}}$$
$$S_n^{*}\left( G_m\right) = \frac{S_n\left(G_m\right)}{\sqrt{n^2\frac{\left(\frac{1}{m}+\frac{1}{n}\right)}{12}}}$$
Therefore, this $S^*$ chart is defined by $CL = 0$ and
$LCL = -Z_{\alpha}$.

## Examples of $r$, $Q$ and $S$ control charts applied using synthetic data

A bivariate data set is used to illustrate how the previously discussed
control charts arise. In fact, a synthetic dataset composed of 540
observations of a bidimensional standard Gaussian variable has been
simulated, in addition to 40 individuals corresponding to another
bidimensional Gaussian variable with mean and standard deviation equal
to 2.

::: example
R\> mu \<- c(0, 0) R\> Sigma \<- matrix(c(1, 0, 0, 1), nrow = 2) R\> Y
\<- rmvnorm(540, mean = mu, sigma = Sigma) R\> u \<- c(2, 2) R\> S \<-
matrix(c(4, 0, 0, 4), nrow = 2) R\> x \<- rmvnorm(40, mean = u, sigma =
S)
:::

Prior to the application of nonparametric control charts, the dataset
has to be converted into a npqcsd object. The synthetic dataset is
arranged as two matrices, G composed of the 500 first rows (multivariate
observations) of Y, and x with the remaining ones and including those
belonging to the second bidimensional variable

::: example
R\> x \<- rbind(Y\[501:540, \], x) R\> G \<- Y\[1:500, \] R\> data.npqcd
\<- npqcd(x, G)
:::

In the same way, the npqcd function creates a data object for non
parametric quality control, the npqcs.r(), npqcs.Q(), and npqcs.S()
functions computes all the statistics required to obtain the $r$, $Q$,
and $S$ control charts, respectively. The argument method = c(\"Tukey\",
\"Liu\", \"Mahalanobis\", \"RP\", \"LD\") specifies the data depth
function, and alpha is the signification level that defines the LCL. See
[@flores2016qualityreview] to obtain additional information about these
functions and their arguments.

### $r$ chart

The $r$ control chart can be obtained by applying the npqcs.r() function
to the npqcd object and plotting the result.

::: example
R\> res.npqcs \<- npqcs.r(data.npqcd, method = \"Tukey\", alpha = 0.025)
R\> plot(res.npqcs, title = \" r Control Chart\")
:::

The resulting chart is shown in
Figure [4](#fig:rchart){reference-type="ref" reference="fig:rchart"},
where it can be observed that the process is out of control from the
42nd observation, as expected, taking into account that most of the
$r_{Gm}(X_i$) values are falling below the LCL.

::: center
![$r$ control chart.](article-rchart-plot.pdf){#fig:rchart width="80%"}
:::

### $Q$ chart

In this case, the dataset is assumed to be composed of rational samples
of size 4. Thus, the $Q$ nonparametric alternative of $\bar{x}$ chart is
proposed and applied to control the bidimensional process:

::: example
R\> n \<- 4 \# samples R\> m \<- 20 \# measurements R\> k \<- 2 \#
number of variables R\> x.a \<- array( , dim = c(n, k, m)) R\> for (i in
1:m)  + x.a\[, , i\] \<- x\[(1 + (i - 1) \* n):(i \* n), \] + R\>
data.npqcd \<- npqcd(x.a, G) R\> res.npqcs \<- npqcs.Q(data.npqcd,
method = \"Tukey\", alpha = 0.025) R\> plot(res.npqcs, title = \"Q
Control Chart\")
:::

Figure [5](#fig:Qchart){reference-type="ref" reference="fig:Qchart"}
clearly shows that the process is out of control in the second half,
from the 20th rational sample. We can also see that the high random
fluctuations of the $r$ chart are attenuated in the $Q$ chart due to the
averaging effect.

::: center
![$Q$ control chart.](article-Qchart-plot.pdf){#fig:Qchart width="80%"}
:::

### $S$ chart

Finally, the nonparametric counterpart of CUSUM control chart is
performed from the multivariate individual observations.

::: example
R\> data.npqcd \<- npqcd(x, G) R\> res.npqcs \<- npqcs.S(data.npqcd,
method = \"Tukey\", alpha = 0.05) R\> plot(res.npqcs, title = \"S
Control Chart\")
:::

Figure [6](#fig:Schart){reference-type="ref" reference="fig:Schart"}
shows that the process is out of control from the 48th observation. Note
that the $S$ graph performs better in identifying small changes in a
process. In this case, the performance of the $Q$ chart is better than
the corresponding to the $S$ chart.

## Control charts for functional data based on data depth

In the paradigm of Industry 4.0, processes and services are many times
described by continuously monitored data of hourly, daily, monthly
curves or smooth functions. When the processes are defined by functional
data, the authors encourage to apply control charts based on Functional
Data Analysis (FDA) in order to implement control and improvement tasks.
In this section, the use of control charts presented in Flores et al.
[@flores2020constructing]. Summarizing, this methodology consists of the
proposal of new Phase I and Phase II control charts to be applied in
those case study in which the datum unit is a curve. Phase I control
chart is based on the computation of functional data depth (specifically
Fraiman and Muniz [@fraiman2001trimmed], Mode [@cuevas2007robust], and
random projections [@cuevas2007robust] data depth) from which a data
depth control chart is developed. Once the in-control calibration sample
is obtained, the Phase II control chart based on functional data depth
and rank nonparametric control chart can be applied. In addition to the
Phase I functional data depth and Phase II rank control charts, plots of
functional envelopes from the original curves are provided in order to
help to identify the possible assignable causes of out of control
states.

### Estimating a Phase I control chart for functional data (calibration)

A dataset is simulated in order to illustrate the use of FDA control
charts for Phase I and II. A functional mean, $mu_0$, and a functional
standard deviation, sigma, are defined as shown in
[@flores2020constructing]. An $n_0=100$ hundred curves composed of
$m=30$ points are simulated. They account for the calibration or
retrospective sample.

::: example
R\> library(fda.usc) R\> m \<- 30 R\> tt\<-seq(0,1,len=m) \# H0 R\>
mu_0\<-30 \* tt \* (1 - tt)\^(3/2) R\> n0 \<- 100 R\>
mdata\<-matrix(NA,ncol=m,nrow=n0) R\> sigma \<-
exp(-3\*as.matrix(dist(tt))/0.9) R\> for (i in 1:n0) mdata\[i,\]\<-
mu_0+0.5\*mvrnorm(mu = mu_0,Sigma = sigma )
:::

Prior to the application of control charts, the dataset is converted in
a specific format by the fdqcd function. A plot function is also
programmed to properly show the original functional data, plot.fdqcd.
Figure [7](#fig:fda_1){reference-type="ref" reference="fig:fda_1"} shows
the original functional data consisting of curves.

::: example
R\> fdchart \<- fdqcd(mdata) R\>
plot(fdchart,type=\"l\",col=\"gray\",main=\"Functional data\")
:::

::: center
![Original curves that account for the calibration
sample.](fda_1.pdf){#fig:fda_1 width="\\textwidth"}
:::

The following step is to identify those curves that account for the
in-control process. This task is done by the application of a Phase I
control chart for functional data. This method is implemented in the
[qcr](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=qcr) package by the fdqcs.depth
function. Specifically, the arguments and default values for these
functions are

::: example
R\> fdqcs.depth.default \<- function(x, data.name=NULL,func.depth =
depth.mode,nb=200, + type = c(\"trim\",\"pond\"),ns = 0.01, + plot =
TRUE, trim = 0.025, smo =0.05, + draw.control = NULL,\...)
:::

where func.depth is the type of depth measure, by default depth.mode, nb
the number of bootstrap resamples, type accounts for the method used to
trim the data, trim or pond [@flores2020constructing], ns is the
quantile to determine the cutoff from the bootstrap procedure
[@flores2020constructing], plot a logical value indicating that it
should be plotted, trim the percentage of the trimming, smo the
smoothing parameter for the bootstrap resampling
[@flores2020constructing], whereas draw.control specifies the col, lty,
and lwd for the fdataobj, statistic, IN and OUT objects. When the
fdqcs.depth function is applied to the curves of the calibration sample,
the fddep object of fdqcs.depth class is obtained. It is composed of the
original data, the depth corresponding to each curve, the lower control
limit of the depth chart, the index of those curves out of control, the
curves that account for the limits of the envelope composed by the
deepest cures, and the deepest curve or functional median.

::: example
R\> fddep \<- fdqcs.depth(fdchart) R\> summary(fddep)
:::

::: example
Length Class Mode fdata 100 fdata list Depth 100 -none- numeric LCL 1
-none- numeric out 1 -none- numeric fmin 1 fdata list fmax 1 fdata list
fmed 1 fdata list ns 1 -none- numeric
:::

::: example
R\> class(fddep)
:::

::: example
\"fdqcs.depth\"
:::

::: example
R\> plot(fddep,title.fdata = \"FDA chart\",title.depth = \"Depth
chart\") R\> out \<- fddep$out; out
\end{example}
\begin{example}
[1] 29
\end{example}


Figure \ref{fig:fda_2} shows the control chart for the depth of the curves (right panel). The LCL is estimated by a smoothed bootstrap procedure \citep{flores2020constructing}. In order to provide a tool to identify the assignable cause of each out-of-control curve, the original curves with the envelope with the 99\% of the deepest curves are also shown (left panel). The analysis of the shape and magnitude of the curves in and out of bounds  can help to associate each curve out of control to an assignable cause, allowing for processes control, maintenance, and improvement.

\begin{figure}[!htb]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{fda_2}
\caption{Left panel: Original curves with the envelope composed of 90\% of the deepest curves. Right panel: Control chart for the depths of the curves (the LCL has been estimated by bootstrap procedures at a signification level of 10\%.}
\label{fig:fda_2}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

Phase I ends when a calibration sample without curves out of control is obtained. The iterative procedure to obtain an in control calibration sample is shown in the following lines.

\begin{example}
R> alpha <- 0.1
R> trim <- 0.1
R> while (length(out)>0) {
R>   mdata <- fddep$fdata$data[-out,]
R>   fddep <- fdqcs.depth(mdata,ns = alpha, trim=trim, plot=FALSE)
R>   out <- fddep$out
R> }
R> plot(fddep,title.fdata = "Envelope with the 90\% deepest curves",
+  title.depth = "Depth control chart")
\end{example}

Figure \ref{fig:fda_3} is obtained from the application of \texorpdfstring%
{{\normalfont\ttfamily\hyphenchar\font=-1 plot}}%
{plot} function to \texorpdfstring%
{{\normalfont\ttfamily\hyphenchar\font=-1 fddep}}%
{fddep} object. It shows that all the curves of the calibration sample are in control, and thus, the natural variability of the process is estimated.

\begin{figure}[!htb]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{fda_3}
\caption{Results corresponding to the second iteration to obtain the in control calibration sample. Left panel: Original curves with the envelope composed of the 90\% of the deepest curves. Right panel: Control chart for the depths of the curves (the LCL has been estimated by bootstrap procedures at a signification level of 10\%.}
\label{fig:fda_3}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Estimating a Phase II control chart for functional data (monitoring)}

The next step is to perform the Phase II of process control. The monitoring phase is performed by the application of Phase II control charts for functional data based on multivariate nonparametric control charts. Firstly, a monitoring sample composed of 50 curves is simulated by the following code.

\begin{example}
R> mu_a<- 30 * tt^(3/2) * (1 - tt)
R> n_a <- 50
R> mdata_a<-matrix(NA,ncol=m,nrow=n_a)
R> for (i in 1:n_a) mdata_a[i,]<- mu_a+0.5*mvrnorm(mu = mu_a,Sigma = sigma )
\end{example}

The curves of the monitoring sample are defined with \texorpdfstring%
{{\normalfont\ttfamily\hyphenchar\font=-1 fdqcd}}%
{fdqcd} format and a control chart for Phase II is developed by applying the \texorpdfstring%
{{\normalfont\ttfamily\hyphenchar\font=-1 fdqcs.rank}}%
{fdqcs.rank} function. It is composed by the following arguments, \texorpdfstring%
{{\normalfont\ttfamily\hyphenchar\font=-1 fdqcs.rank(x, y = x, func.depth = depth.FM, alpha = 0.01, plot = TRUE, trim = 0.1, draw.control = NULL,...)}}%
{fdqcs.rank(x, y = x, func.depth = depth.FM, alpha = 0.01, plot = TRUE, trim = 0.1, draw.control = NULL,...)}.

\begin{example}
R> fdchart_a <- fdqcd(mdata_a,"Monitoring curves")
R> phase2.chart <- fdqcs.rank(fdchart,fdchart_a)
R> plot(phase2.chart)
R> summary(phase2.chart)
\end{example}

Figure \ref{fig:fda_4} accounts for the FDA chart with the calibration sample and its envelope composed by the deepest curves. Moreover, the monitoring sample is also included and compared with the calibration sample by using the FDA chart. In addition, the Phase II rank control chart for functional data is shown including both calibration and monitoring samples or only the ranks corresponding to the monitoring sample. The second population that corresponds with the monitoring sample is identified by the control chart from the first monitored curve (panels below in Figure \ref{fig:fda_4}).

\begin{figure}[!htb]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{fda_4}
\caption{First row: the left and right panels show the FDA charts for the calibrating and monitoring samples with a signification level of 0.01. Second row: The left and right panels show the Phase II rank control chart for functional data, including calibration and monitoring sample (left panel) and only monitoring sample (right panel).}

\section{Process capability analysis}
%-------------------------------------------

The analysis of the capability of a process in the case of statistical quality control is done through the calculation of the so-called capability. 
These indices measure whether a process is capable or not of meeting the corresponding technical specifications set by the customer, or the manufacturer, by comparing those with the natural variability of the CTQ variable that characterizes the process. 
The interpretation of these indices is associated with the result of this relation. 
Capability indices are generally calculated as the ratio between the length of the specification interval and the natural variability of the process in terms of$$. 
Large values of these indices mean that the corresponding process is capable of producing articles that meet the requirements of the client and manufacturers.
In other words, the larger the value of the capability index, the smaller the number of products outside the specification limits.

In this section, we describe the capability indices for processes whose underlying distribution is normal and not normal (exponential, Weibull, etc.).
However, it is important to note that the development of programming tools for nonparametric capability analysis is one of the main goals and contributions of the \href{https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=qcr}{\texorpdfstring%
{{\normalfont\fontseries{b}\selectfont qcr}}%
{qcr}} package. 
In addition to the estimation of capability indices, a graphical output is provided. 
Based on the proposal of \texorpdfstring%
{{\normalfont\fontseries{b}\selectfont qualityTools}}%
{qualityTools} package, the \href{https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=qcr}{\texorpdfstring%
{{\normalfont\fontseries{b}\selectfont qcr}}%
{qcr}} graphical output for capability analysis includes a normality test for the CTQ variable, a Q-Q plot, a histogram with the theoretical Gaussian distribution density, parametric and nonparametric estimates of capability indices and a contour capability control chart.
In the following lines, parametric and nonparametric capability analysis utilities are described using different examples of applications.

%-------------------------------------------
\subsection{Assuming a normal distribution}
%-------------------------------------------

The most widely used capability indexes in the industry analyze the process capability under the assumptions of a 
stabilized process (in control) and a Gaussian distributed CTQ variable.
Table \ref{PCR} shows the main parametric (assuming Gaussian distribution) indices, namely$C_p$,$C\_pk$,$C\_pm$, and$C\_pmk$.

\citet{vannman1995unified} proposed a general formulation of these indices by an expression that depends on the non-negative parameters$u$and$v$:$$C_p\left( u,v\right)= \frac{d-u\vert \mu - m\vert}{3\sqrt{\sigma^2+v\left( \mu - T\right)^2}},$$whereby$d=(USL-LSL)/2$,$m=(LSL+USL)/2$,$USL$is the upper specification limit, the$LSL$is the lower specification limit,$$is the theoretical standard deviation,$$accounts for the theoretical mean of the CTQ variable, and$T$is the specification target (by default the mean between the$LSL$and$USL$). 
The indices shown in Table \ref{PCR} are obtained from this expression just considering values of 0 or 1 for$u$and$v$:$C_p(
0, 0) = C_p$,$C_p( 1, 0) = C\_pk$,$C_p( 0, 1) = C\_pm$,$C_p( 1, 1) =
C\_pmk$.\\

\begin{table}[!htb]

\label{PCR}
\end{table}

The piston rings data set is used to illustrate the calculation of the capability indices using the \texorpdfstring%
{{\normalfont\ttfamily\hyphenchar\font=-1 qcs.cp()}}%
{qcs.cp()} function based on the expressions previously described in Table \ref{PCR}. From the statistics obtained from the$\|x$control chart of pistonrings dataset, the$$and$$values are estimated, and the corresponding capability index is computed.
\begin{example}
R> data("pistonrings")
R> xbar <- qcs.xbar(pistonrings[1:125, ], plot = FALSE)
R> limits <- c(lsl = 73.99, usl = 74.01)
R> # qcs.cp(object = xbar, parameters = c(0, 0), limits = limits, 
R> #        contour = FALSE)
R> # qcs.cp(object = xbar, parameters = c(1, 0), limits = limits, 
R> #        contour = FALSE)
R> # qcs.cp(object = xbar, parameters = c(0, 1), limits = limits, 
R> #        contour = FALSE)
R> qcs.cp(object = xbar, parameters = c(1, 1), limits = limits, 
+         contour = FALSE)
\end{example}
\begin{example}
     Cpmk delta.usl gamma.usl 
   0.2984    0.1176    0.9785 
\end{example}

Consequently, the obtained results are$
C_p=0.3407$,$C\_pk=0.3006$,$C\_pm=0.3382$, and$
C\_pmk=0.2984$, respectively. The argument \texorpdfstring%
{{\normalfont\ttfamily\hyphenchar\font=-1 parameters}}%
{parameters} account for$u$and$v$values, while \texorpdfstring%
{{\normalfont\ttfamily\hyphenchar\font=-1 object}}%
{object} is the type of control chart from which the$$is estimated, \texorpdfstring%
{{\normalfont\ttfamily\hyphenchar\font=-1 limits}}%
{limits} are the specification control limits, and \texorpdfstring%
{{\normalfont\ttfamily\hyphenchar\font=-1 contour}}%
{contour} is the parameter that indicates when the process capability contour chart is plotted.

%-------------------------------------------
\subsection{Process capability plot}
%-------------------------------------------
In \citet{vannman2001graphical} and \citet{deleryd1999process}, a graphical method (based on common capability indices) to analyze the capability of a process is proposed. 
The goal of using this type of plot (if compared with respect to only capability indices calculation) is to provide immediate information of the location and spread of the CTQ feature and about the capability to meet the specifications of the corresponding process. 
When using this chart, a process will be$capable$if the process capability index is higher than a certain value$k$, with$k\>
1$. 
The most used values for$k$are$k = 1$,$k = 4/3$, or$k =
5/3$, even 2 at a Six Sigma level, taking into account the usual index limits for which a process could be assumed capable.  
It will also be assumed that the target value matches the center of the specification interval, that is,$T
= = m$. 
Then, one of the indices defined by the$C_p(
u,v)$family is used, e.g.,$C\_pk$or$C\_pm$,
and the process will be defined as capable if$C_p( u, v )\>
k$, given the values of$u$,$v$, and$k$. 
Also note that if$= T$, all the$C_p( u,
v)$indices are defined by the same expression as the$C_p$. 
Moreover, different setting for$u$,$v$, and$k$impose different constraints on the process parameters$(
, )$. 
This can be easily seen through a process capability plot. 
This graph is a contour plot of$C_p( u, v) =
k$as a function of$$and$$, but it can also be defined as a function of$$and$$, with$=
$and$= $. 
The contour line is obtained by rewriting the index$C_p(
u,v)$as a function of$$and$$as follows$ C_p( u,v)= $. 
Therefore, the$C_p( u,v) =
k$equation is solved, plotting$$depending on the values of$$. 
The resulting expressions are:$$\gamma = \sqrt{\frac{\left( 1-u\vert\delta\vert\right)}{9k^2}-v\delta^2}, \; \vert\delta\vert \leq \frac{1}{u+3k\sqrt{v}}, \; \left( u,v\right) \neq \left(0,0 \right)$$When$u
= v = 0$, that is, when we consider the index$C_p=k$, we have$= $and$$. 
It is important to highlight that the$$-axis accounts for the process spread, whereas the$$-axis accounts for the process location. 
The values of the parameters$$and$$which provide values$(
,)$within the region bounded by the contour line$C_p(u, v) =
k$and the$$-axis will provide a larger$C_p(u,
v)$value than$k$, leading a capable process. 
Furthermore, values of$$and$$which provide values$(
,)$outside this region will provide a value$C_p(u,
v)$smaller than$k$, i.e., a non-capable process. 
In the case of the process not being capable, this type of plot is useful to understand if the corrective actions have to be performed to decrease the process spread, or the process location (deviation with respect to target), or even when both changes are needed to improve the process capability. 
This can be observed by observing the distance with respect to the$x$and$y$-axis. 
Below are some examples of capability plot application which can be generated through the application of the \texorpdfstring%
{{\normalfont\ttfamily\hyphenchar\font=-1 qcs.cp}}%
{qcs.cp} function with \texorpdfstring%
{{\normalfont\ttfamily\hyphenchar\font=-1 contour=TRUE}}%
{contour=TRUE} and \texorpdfstring%
{{\normalfont\ttfamily\hyphenchar\font=-1 k=1}}%
{k=1} (default values):
\begin{example}
R> oldpar <- par(mfrow = c(2, 2))
R> qcs.cp(object = xbar, parameters = c(0, 0), limits = limits, 
+         ylim = c(0, 1))
R> qcs.cp(object = xbar, parameters = c(1, 0), limits = limits,  
+         ylim = c(0, 1))
R> qcs.cp(object = xbar, parameters = c(0, 1), limits = limits,  
+         ylim = c(0, 1))
R> qcs.cp(object = xbar, parameters = c(1, 1), limits = limits,  
+         ylim = c(0, 1))
R> par(oldpar)
\end{example}
The result is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:cpplot}. In all the cases, the points in red are out of the area defined by the line in blue and the$$axis. 
Thus, the corresponding process is not capable, no matter the capability index that is used.
In any case, note that the$C\_p$index is useless in identifying non-capable processes due to location shifts 
with respect to the target. 
In the same way, the$C\_pk$index assumes as capable processes that are far from the target as long as they were close to the specification limits (as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:cpplot}). 
Thus, the use of the$C\_pm$and$C\_pmk$are recommended due to they take into account both shifts from the target and the spread. 
In the present case, the process is not capable due to the spread rather than the target shift.
Therefore, the process changes could be due to decreases in the variability process.

\end{figure}

%-------------------------------------------
\subsection{Estimated process capability plot}
%-------------------------------------------


In practice, the process parameters are unknown and we need to estimate them.  We can perform a decision rule based on the sample statistics that provide a sample estimate of the capability index and, finally the so called estimated process capability plot, also called$\^\*-\^\*$plot \citep{deleryd1999process}. 
It allows us to decide whether a process is capable or not assuming that$$and$$parameters are unknown and estimated by$=\|X$and$\^2=\_i=1\^nX\^2_i-\|X\^2$. 
They are the maximum likelihood estimators when the CTQ variable of the process is normally distributed, and$
X_1,X_2,...,X_n$is a random sample of a normal distribution with$$mean and$\^2$variance.\\
The \href{https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=qcr}{\texorpdfstring%
{{\normalfont\fontseries{b}\selectfont qcr}}%
{qcr}} package only provides the$\^\*-\^\*$plot corresponding to the$C\_pm$index taking into account that the other capability indices do not consider shifts from the target value in their calculations. 
For the general case, see the work of \cite{vannman2001graphical}. 
In order to obtain an appropriate decision rule for the case of$C\_pm$index, we test the hypotheses$H_0
: C\_pm k_0$versus$H_1 : C\_pm \>
k_0$, using$$\hat{C}_{pm}= \frac{d}{3\sqrt{\hat{\sigma}^2+\left( \hat{\mu} - T\right)^2}}$$as test statistic. 
The null hypothesis will be rejected if$\_pm \>
c\_$, where the constant$c\_$is determined by previously defining a signifition test level$$. 
\citet{vannman2001graphical} showed that the null hypothesis$H_0:C\_pm
k_0$can be reduced to$H_0:C\_pm=k_0$. 
Thus, for given values of$$and$n$, the process will be considered capable if$\_pm
\> c\_$, with$c\_ \> k_0$. 
\citet{hubele2004effect} proved that, when the$C\_pm$index is used, the critical value for a given$$is obtained as$$c_{\alpha}=k_0\sqrt{\frac{n}{\chi^2_{\alpha,n}}},$$where$\^2\_,n$is the quantile$$of a$\^2$distribution with$n$degrees of freedom.
The \href{https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=qcr}{\texorpdfstring%
{{\normalfont\fontseries{b}\selectfont qcr}}%
{qcr}} package includes the \texorpdfstring%
{{\normalfont\ttfamily\hyphenchar\font=-1 qcs.hat.cpm()}}%
{qcs.hat.cpm()} function to obtain both the theoretical capability plot and the estimated capability plot from sample statistics. 
Among other options, the user can indicate the control chart from which the estimates$$and$$are obtained (alternatively,$$and$$can be introduced through \texorpdfstring%
{{\normalfont\ttfamily\hyphenchar\font=-1 mu}}%
{mu} and \texorpdfstring%
{{\normalfont\ttfamily\hyphenchar\font=-1 std.dev}}%
{std.dev}), and the specification limits using \texorpdfstring%
{{\normalfont\ttfamily\hyphenchar\font=-1 limits}}%
{limits}. 
Furthermore, the signification level and the capability limit can be modified, as they are set to$$and$k_0=1$by default. 
The following code illustrates its application to \texorpdfstring%
{{\normalfont\ttfamily\hyphenchar\font=-1 pistonrings}}%
{pistonrings} data. 
\begin{example}
R> xbar <- qcs.xbar(pistonrings[1:125, ], plot = FALSE)
R> limits <- c(lsl = 73.99, usl = 74.01)
R> # qcs.hat.cpm(object = xbar, limits = limits, ylim = c(0,1))
R> mu <- xbar$center R\> std.dev \<- xbar$std.dev
R> qcs.hat.cpm(limits = limits, mu = mu, std.dev = std.dev, ylim = c(0,1))
\end{example}
The result is shown in Figure \ref{fig:cpplot2}. 
The contour line corresponding to the capability region obtained from the capability index sample is always more restrictive than the corresponding theoretical one.

\subsection{Nonparametric capability analysis}
%-------------------------------------------

Traditional assumptions about data such as normality or independence are frequently violated in many real situations. 
Thus, in scenarios in which assumptions of normality are not verified, the indices defined in the previous sections are not valid. 
\citet{pearn1997practical} and \citet{tong1998lower} proposed generalizations of$C_p(u,
v)$for the case of arbitrary distributions of data$$C_{Np}\left( u,v\right)= \frac{d-u\vert M - m\vert}{3\sqrt{\left(\frac{F_{99.865}-F_{0.135}}{6} \right)^2+v\left( M - T\right)^2}},$$where$F\_$is the percentile$$\% of the corresponding distribution and$M$the median of the process. 
However, the distribution of the underlying process is always unknown. 
\cite{chang1994pci} calculated estimates for$F\_99.865$,$F\_0.135$and$M$based on the sample percentiles.

\citet{pearn1997practical} proposed the following estimator$$\hat{C}_{Np}\left( u,v\right)= \frac{d-u\vert \hat{M} - m\vert}{3\sqrt{\left(\frac{U_p-L_p}{6} \right)^2+v\left( \hat{M} - T\right)^2}}$$where$U_p$is an estimator for$F\_99.865$,$L_p$is an estimator for$F\_0.135$, and$$is an estimator for$M$, obtained from the tables developed by \cite{gruska1989non}. 

The \texorpdfstring%
{{\normalfont\ttfamily\hyphenchar\font=-1 qcs.cpn()}}%
{qcs.cpn()} function of \href{https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=qcr}{\texorpdfstring%
{{\normalfont\fontseries{b}\selectfont qcr}}%
{qcr}} calculates$C\_Np$,$C\_Npk$,$C\_Npm$, and$C\_Npmk$using the formulation described by \citet{tong1998lower}. 
The code that illustrates its use is shown below. 
To obtain the nonparametric capability indices it is necessary to indicate the$u$and$v$parameters.
\begin{example}
R> xbar <- qcs.xbar(pistonrings[1:125, ], plot = FALSE)
R> limits <- c(lsl = 73.99, usl = 74.01)
R> # x <- xbar$statistics\[\[1\]\] R\> \# median \<- median(x) R\> \# q
= quantile(x, probs = c(0.00135, 0.99865)) \# c(lq, uq) R\> \#
qcs.cpn(parameters = c(0, 0), limits = limits, median = median, q = q)
R\> \# qcs.cpn(object = xbar, parameters = c(0, 0), limits = limits) R\>
\# qcs.cpn(object = xbar, parameters = c(1, 0), limits = limits) R\> \#
qcs.cpn(object = xbar, parameters = c(0, 1), limits = limits) R\>
qcs.cpn(object = xbar, parameters = c(1, 1), limits = limits)

CNpmk 0.9015

Thus, the values obtained are $C_{Np}=1.0082$, $C_{Npk}=0.9275$,
$C_{Npm}=0.9799$ and $C_{Npmk}=0.9015$. If a capability limit of $k=1$
or $k=1.33$ is assumed, we can infer that the process is not actually
capable to meet the customers or manager's requirements.

## Tools for a comprehensive processs capability analysis

Function qcs.ca() provides a comprehensive information of the capability
of a process, summarized through a graphical output. This function
calculates the process capability indices $C_p$, $C_{pk}$, $C_{pL}$,
$C_{pU}$, $C_{pm}$, $C_{pmk}$ from a qcs object, assuming a Gaussian
distribution. Moreover, it computes confidence limits for $C_p$ using
the method described by @chou1990lower. Approximate confidence limits
for $C_{pl}$, $C_{pu}$, and $C_{pk}$ are also estimated using the method
described in @bissell1990reliable, while the confidence limits for
$C_{pm}$ are based on the approximated method of @boyles1991taguchi that
assumes the target is the mean of the specification limits. Moreover,
the $C_{Np}$, $C_{Npk}$, $C_{Npm}$, and $C_{Npmk}$ nonparametric
capability indices are also obtained. There is also a specific box
within the summary plot that shows the proportion of observations and
expected observations under the Gaussian assumption out of the
specification limits (nonconforming observations). Further, a histogram
of the data sample is provided, in addition to the corresponding
Gaussian density curves obtained from the sample estimates (one per
standard deviation estimate procedure). They are displayed along with
the specification limits, a quantile-quantile plot for the specified
distribution, and a process capability plot obtained from the $C_{pm}$
index (both using theoretical and sample alternatives). In order to
describe the qcs.ca() performance, the following code corresponds to the
analysis of the first 125 observations of the pistonrings dataset (the
corresponding output is shown in Figure
[8](#fig:caplot){reference-type="ref" reference="fig:caplot"}).

# Conclusions

The [qcr](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=qcr) package has been
developed to provide users with a comprehensive set of functions that
manage statistical process control, ranging from univariate parametric
analysis to multivariate and FDA nonparametric statistics. This package
includes the main types of control charts and capability indices. It
combines the main features of reputed SQC packages in R such as
[qcc](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=qcc) and qualityTools with the
proposal of a new graphical appearance and the implementation of new SQC
tools with increasing importance in Industry 4.0 such as multivariate
and nonparametric analysis.\
In addition to some utilities provided by reference R packages such as
[qcc](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=qcc),
[SixSigma](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=SixSigma), and
qualityTools, [qcr](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=qcr) implements
very important statistical techniques of Control and Analysis tasks of
the Six Sigma procedure that are not included in other libraries. In the
case of multivariate control charts, these tools are the MEWMA and
MCUSUM multivariate control charts, on the one hand, and the $r$, $Q$
and $S$ nonparametric control charts based on data depth, on the other
hand. In addition, Phase I and Phase II control charts for functional
data (monthly, daily, hourly curves) based on functional data depth,
bootstrap procedures, and nonparametric rank charts have also been
implemented in the [qcr](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=qcr)
package. These control charts for functional data provide tools to
control and improve processes when their CTQ variables are obtained as
hourly, monthly, daily, yearly smooth curves.\
It is also very important to note that
[qcr](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=qcr) provides functions to
perform nonparametric capability analysis. In addition, the new
implementation of the process capability plots for the main parametric
capability indices allows us to analyze if improvements in process
spread or/and process location are needed to obtain a capable process.
The comparison between suppliers, machines, etc., is enabled through
capability plots.\
All these utilities intend to make
[qcr](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=qcr) a useful tool for users of
a wide variety of industries, providing a competitive alternative to
commercial software.
