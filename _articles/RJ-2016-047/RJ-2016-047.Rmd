title: Calculating Biological Module Enrichment or Depletion and Visualizing Data
  on Large-scale Molecular Maps with ACSNMineR and RNaviCell Packages
abstract: Biological pathways or modules represent sets of interactions or functional
  relationships occurring at the molecular level in living cells. A large body of
  knowledge on pathways is organized in public databases such as the KEGG, Reactome,
  or in more specialized repositories, the Atlas of Cancer Signaling Network (ACSN)
  being an example. All these open biological databases facilitate analyses, improving
  our understanding of cellular systems. We hereby describe ACSNMineR for calculation
  of enrichment or depletion of lists of genes of interest in biological pathways.
  ACSNMineR integrates ACSN molecular pathways gene sets, but can use any gene set
  encoded as a GMT file, for instance sets of genes available in the Molecular Signatures
  Database (MSigDB). We also present RNaviCell, that can be used in conjunction with
  ACSNMineR to visualize different data types on web-based, interactive ACSN maps.
  We illustrate the functionalities of the two packages with biological data taken
  from large-scale cancer datasets.
