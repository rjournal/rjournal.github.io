title: ShinyItemAnalysis for Teaching Psychometrics and to Enforce Routine Analysis
  of Educational Tests
abstract: This work introduces ShinyItemAnalysis, an R package and an online shiny
  application for psychometric analysis of educational tests and items. ShinyItemAnalysis
  covers a broad range of psy chometric methods and offers data examples, model equations,
  parameter estimates, interpretation of results, together with a selected R code,
  and is therefore suitable for teaching psychometric concepts with R. Furthermore,
  the application aspires to be an easy-to-use tool for analysis of educational tests
  by allowing the users to upload and analyze their own data and to automatically
  generate analysis reports in PDF or HTML. We argue that psychometric analysis should
  be a routine part of test development in order to gather proofs of reliability and
  validity of the measurement, and we demonstrate how ShinyItemAnalysis may help enforce
  this goal.
