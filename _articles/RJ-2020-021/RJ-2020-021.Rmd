title: 'tsmp: An R Package for Time Series with Matrix Profile'
abstract: This article describes tsmp, an R package that implements the MP concept
  for TS. The tsmp package is a toolkit that allows all-pairs similarity joins, motif,
  discords and chains discovery, semantic segmentation, etc. Here we describe how
  the tsmp package may be used by showing some of the use-cases from the original
  articles and evaluate the algorithm speed in the R environment. This package can
  be downloaded at https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=tsmp.
