title: Prinsimp
abstract: Principal Components Analysis (PCA) is a common way to study the sources
  of variation in a high-dimensional data set. Typically, the leading principal components
  are used to understand the variation in the data or to reduce the dimension of the
  data for subsequent analysis. The remaining principal components are ignored since
  they explain little of the variation in the data. However, the space spanned by
  the low variation principal components may contain interesting structure, structure
  that PCA cannot find. Prinsimp is an R package that looks for interesting structure
  of low variability. “Interesting” is defined in terms of a simplicity measure. Looking
  for interpretable structure in a low variability space has particular importance
  in evolutionary biology, where such structure can signify the existence of a genetic
  constraint.
