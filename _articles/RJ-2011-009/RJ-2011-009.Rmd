title: Probabilistic Weather Forecasting in R
abstract: This article describes two R packages for probabilistic weather forecasting,
  ensembleBMA, which offers ensemble postprocessing via Bayesian model averaging (BMA),
  and ProbForecastGOP, which implements the geostatistical output perturbation (GOP)
  method. BMA forecasting models use mixture distributions, in which each component
  corresponds to an ensemble member, and the form of the component distribution depends
  on the weather parameter (temperature, quantitative precipitation or wind speed).
  The model parameters are estimated from training data. The GOP technique uses geostatistical
  methods to produce probabilistic forecasts of entire weather fields for temperature
  or pressure, based on a single numerical forecast on a spatial grid. Both packages
  include functions for evaluating predictive performance, in addition to model fitting
  and forecasting.
