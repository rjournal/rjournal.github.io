title: 'treeClust: An R Package for Tree-Based Clustering Dissimilarities'
abstract: This paper describes treeClust, an R package that produces dissimilarities
  useful for cluster ing. These dissimilarities arise from a set of classification
  or regression trees, one with each variable in the data acting in turn as a the
  response, and all others as predictors. This use of trees produces dissim ilarities
  that are insensitive to scaling, benefit from automatic variable selection, and
  appear to perform well. The software allows a number of options to be set, affecting
  the set of objects returned in the call; the user can also specify a clustering
  algorithm and, optionally, return only the clustering vector. The package can also
  generate a numeric data set whose inter-point distances relate to the treeClust
  ones; such a numeric data set can be much smaller than the vector of inter-point
  dissimilarities, a useful feature in big data sets.
