title: 'betategarch: Simulation, Estimation and Forecasting of Beta-Skew-t-EGARCH
  Models'
abstract: This paper illustrates the usage of the betategarch package, a package for
  the simulation, estimation and forecasting of Beta-Skew-t-EGARCH models. The Beta-Skew-t-EGARCH
  model is a dynamic model of the scale or volatility of financial returns. The model
  is characterised by its robustness to jumps or outliers, and by its exponential
  specification of volatility. The latter enables richer dynamics, since parameters
  need not be restricted to be positive to ensure positivity of volatility. In addition,
  the model also allows for heavy tails and skewness in the conditional return (i.e.
  scaled return), and for leverage and a time-varying long-term component in the volatility
  specification. More generally, the model can be viewed as a model of the scale of
  the error in a dynamic regression.
