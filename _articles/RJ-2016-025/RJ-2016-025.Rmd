title: Using DECIPHER v2.0 to Analyze Big Biological Sequence Data in R
abstract: In recent years, the cost of DNA sequencing has decreased at a rate that
  has outpaced improvements in memory capacity. It is now common to collect or have
  access to many gigabytes of biological sequences. This has created an urgent need
  for approaches that analyze sequences in subsets without requiring all of the sequences
  to be loaded into memory at one time. It has also opened opportunities to improve
  the organization and accessibility of information acquired in sequencing projects.
  The DECIPHER package offers solutions to these problems by assisting in the curation
  of large sets of biological sequences stored in compressed format inside a database.
  This approach has many practical advantages over standard bioinformatics workflows,
  and enables large analyses that would otherwise be prohibitively time consuming.
