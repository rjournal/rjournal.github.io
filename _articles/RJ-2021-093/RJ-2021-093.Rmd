title: 'mgee2: An R package for marginal analysis of longitudinal ordinal data with
  misclassified responses and covariates'
abstract: Marginal methods have been widely used for analyzing longitudinal ordinal
  data due to their simplicity in model assumptions, robustness in inference results,
  and easiness in the implementation. However, they are often inapplicable in the
  presence of measurement errors in the variables. Under the setup of longitudinal
  studies with ordinal responses and covariates subject to misclassification, Chen
  et al. (2014) developed marginal methods for misclassification adjustments using
  the second-order estimating equations and proposed a two-stage estimation approach
  when the validation subsample is available. Parameter estimation is conducted through
  the Newton-Raphson algorithm, and the asymptotic distribution of the estimators
  is established. While the methods of Chen et al. (2014) can successfully correct
  the misclassification effects, its implementation is not accessible to general users
  due to the lack of a software package. In this paper, we develop an R package, mgee2,
  to implement the marginal methods proposed by Chen et al. (2014). To evaluate the
  performance and illustrate the features of the package, we conduct numerical studies.
