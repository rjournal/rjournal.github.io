title: 'Welfare, Inequality and Poverty Analysis with rtip: An Approach Based on Stochastic
  Dominance'
abstract: Disparities in economic welfare, inequality and poverty across and within
  countries are of great interest to sociologists, economists, researchers, social
  organizations and political scientists. Information about these topics is commonly
  based on surveys. We present a package called rtip that implements techniques based
  on stochastic dominance to make unambiguous comparisons, in terms of welfare, poverty
  and inequality, among income distributions. Besides providing point estimates and
  confidence intervals for the most commonly used indicators of these characteristics,
  the package rtip estimates the usual Lorenz curve, the generalized Lorenz curve,
  the TIP (Three I’s of Poverty) curve and allows to test statistically whether one
  curve is dominated by another.
