title: 'PAsso: an R Package for Assessing Partial Association between Ordinal Variables'
abstract: Partial association, the dependency between variables after adjusting for
  a set of covariates, is an important statistical notion for scientific research.
  However, if the variables of interest are ordered categorical data, the development
  of statistical methods and software for assessing their partial association is limited.
  Following the framework established by Liu et al. (2021), we develop an R package
  PAsso for assessing Partial Associations between ordinal variables. The package
  provides various functions that allow users to perform a wide spectrum of assessments,
  including quantification, visualization, and hypothesis testing. In this paper,
  we discuss the implementation of PAsso in detail and demonstrate its utility through
  an analysis of the 2016 American National Election Study.
