title: 'Weighted Distance Based Discriminant Analysis: The R Package WeDiBaDis'
abstract: 'The WeDiBaDis package provides a user friendly environment to perform discriminant
  analysis (supervised classification). WeDiBaDis is an easy to use package addressed
  to the biological and medical communities, and in general, to researchers interested
  in applied studies. It can be suitable when the user is interested in the problem
  of constructing a discriminant rule on the basis of distances between a relatively
  small number of instances or units of known unbalanced-class membership measured
  on many (possibly thousands) features of any type. This is a current situation when
  analyzing genetic biomedical data. This discriminant rule can then be used both,
  as a means of explaining differences among classes, but also in the important task
  of assigning the class membership for new unlabeled units. Our package implements
  two discriminant analysis procedures in an R environment: the well-known distance-based
  discriminant analysis (DB-discriminant) and a weighted distance-based discriminant
  (WDB-discriminant), a novel classifier rule that we introduce. This new procedure
  is based on an improvement of the DB rule taking into account the statistical depth
  of the units. This article presents both classifying procedures and describes the
  implementation of each in detail. We illustrate the use of the package using an
  ecological and a genetic experimental example. Finally, we illustrate the effectiveness
  of the new proposed procedure (WDB), as compared with DB. This comparison is carried
  out using thirty-eight, high-dimensional, class-unbalanced, cancer data sets, three
  of which include clinical features.'
