title: 'IndexNumber: An R Package for Measuring the Evolution of Magnitudes'
abstract: ' Index numbers are descriptive statistical measures useful in economic
  settings for comparing simple and complex magnitudes registered, usually in two
  time periods. Although this theory has a large history, it still plays an important
  role in modern today''s societies where big amounts of economic data are available
  and need to be analyzed. After a detailed revision on classical index numbers in
  literature, this paper is focused on the description of the R package [IndexNumber](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=IndexNumber)
  with strong capabilities for calculating them. Two of the four real data sets contained
  in this library are used for illustrating the determination of the index numbers
  in this work. Graphical tools are also implemented in order to show the time evolution
  of considered magnitudes simplifying the interpretation of the results. '
