title: Generalized Hermite Distribution Modelling with the R Package hermite
abstract: The Generalized Hermite distribution (and the Hermite distribution as a
  particular case) is often used for fitting count data in the presence of overdispersion
  or multimodality. Despite this, to our knowledge, no standard software packages
  have implemented specific functions to compute basic probabilities and make simple
  statistical inference based on these distributions. We present here a set of computational
  tools that allows the user to face these difficulties by modelling with the Generalized
  Hermite distribution using the R package hermite. The package can also be used to
  generate random deviates from a Generalized Hermite distribution and to use basic
  functions to compute probabilities (density, cumulative density and quantile functions
  are available), to estimate parameters using the maximum likelihood method and to
  perform the likelihood ratio test for Poisson assumption against a Generalized Hermite
  alternative. In order to improve the density and quantile functions performance
  when the parameters are large, Edgeworth and Cornish-Fisher expansions have been
  used. Hermite regression is also a useful tool for modeling inflated count data,
  so its inclusion to a commonly used software like R will make this tool available
  to a wide range of potential users. Some examples of usage in several fields of
  application are also given.
