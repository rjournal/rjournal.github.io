title: 'PivotalR: A Package for Machine Learning on Big Data'
abstract: PivotalR is an R package that provides a front-end to PostgreSQL and all
  PostgreSQL-like databases such as Pivotal Inc.’s Greenplum Database (GPDB) (Pivotal
  Inc., 2013a), HAWQ (Pivotal Inc., 2013b). When running on the products of Pivotal
  Inc., PivotalR utilizes the full power of parallel computation and distributive
  storage, and thus gives the normal R user access to big data. PivotalR also provides
  the R wrapper for MADlib. MADlib is an open-source library for scalable in-database
  analytics. It provides data-parallel implementations of mathematical, statistical
  and machine-learning algorithms for structured and unstructured data. Thus PivotalR
  also enables the user to apply machine learning algorithms onto big data.
