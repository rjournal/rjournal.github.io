title: 'GeoAdjust: Adjusting for Positional Uncertainty in Geostatistial Analysis
  of DHS Data'
abstract: |
  The R-package GeoAdjust adjusts for positional uncertainty in GPS
  coordinates and performs fast empirical Bayesian geostatistical
  inference for household survey data from the Demographic and Health
  Surveys (DHS) Program. DHS household survey data is important for
  tracking demographic and health indicators, but is published with
  intentional positional error to preserve the privacy of the household
  respondents. Such jittering has recently been shown to deteriorate
  geostatistical inference and prediction, and GeoAdjust is the first
  software package that corrects for jittering in geostatistical models
  containing both spatial random effects and raster- and distance-based
  covariates. The package provides inference for model parameters and
  predictions at unobserved locations, and supports Gaussian, binomial
  and Poisson likelihoods with identity link, logit link, and log link
  functions, respectively. GeoAdjust provides functions that make model
  and prior specification intuitive and flexible for the user, as well
  as routines for plotting and output analysis.
