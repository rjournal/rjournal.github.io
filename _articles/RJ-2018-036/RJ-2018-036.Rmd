title: Small Area Disease Risk Estimation and Visualization Using R
abstract: Small area disease risk estimation is essential for disease prevention and
  control. In this paper, we demonstrate how R can be used to obtain disease risk
  estimates and quantify risk factors using areal data. We explain how to define disease
  risk models and how to perform Bayesian inference using the INLA package. We also
  show how to make interactive maps of estimates using the leaflet package to better
  understand the disease spatial patterns and communicate the results. We show an
  example of lung cancer risk in Pennsylvania, United States, in year 2002, and demonstrate
  that R represents an excellent tool for disease surveillance by enabling reproducible
  health data analysis.
