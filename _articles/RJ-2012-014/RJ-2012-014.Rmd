title: 'Rfit: Rank-based Estimation for Linear Models'
abstract: In the nineteen seventies, Jurečková and Jaeckel proposed rank estimation
  for linear models. Since that time, several authors have developed inference and
  diagnostic methods for these estimators. These rank-based estimators and their associated
  inference are highly efficient and are robust to outliers in response space. The
  methods include estimation of standard errors, tests of general linear hypotheses,
  confidence intervals, diagnostic procedures including studentized residuals, and
  measures of influential cases. We have developed an R package, Rfit, for computing
  of these robust procedures. In this paper we highlight the main features of the
  package. The package uses standard linear model syntax and includes many of the
  main inference and diagnostic functions.
