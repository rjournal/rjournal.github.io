title: Raster Images in R Graphics
abstract: The R graphics engine has new support for rendering raster images via the
  functions rasterImage() and grid.raster(). This leads to better scaling of raster
  images, faster rendering to screen, and smaller graphics files. Several examples
  of possible applications of these new features are described.
