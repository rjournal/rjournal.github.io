title: Exploring Interaction Effects in Two-Factor Studies using the hiddenf Package
  in R.
abstract: In crossed, two-factor studies with one observation per factor-level combination,
  interaction effects between factors can be hard to detect and can make the choice
  of a suitable statistical model difficult. This article describes *hiddenf*, an
  R package that enables users to quantify and characterize a certain form of interaction
  in two-factor layouts. When effects of one factor (a) fall into two groups depending
  on the level of another factor, and (b) are constant within these groups, the interaction
  pattern is deemed \"hidden additivity\" because within groups, the effects of the
  two factors are additive, while between groups the factors are allowed to interact.
  The *hiddenf* software can be used to estimate, test, and report an appropriate
  factorial effects model corresponding to hidden additivity, which is intermediate
  between the unavailable full factorial model and the overly-simplistic additive
  model. Further, the software also conducts five statistical tests for interaction
  proposed between 1949 and 2014. A collection of 17 datasets is used for illustration.

# Introduction {#Intro}

The crossed, two-factor layout with one observation per factor-level
combination is a simple and widely used plan. These designs arise in the
context of (a) completely randomized two-factor experiments, (b)
randomized complete block experiments that block on a source of nuisance
variability, and (c) observational studies with two factors. If the
effects of the two factors do not interact, then this design permits
inference for both factors simultaneously. The following model is
commonly used for data collected using these designs:

$$\label{eq:RCBD}
  y_{ij}=\mu + \tau_i + \beta_j + \epsilon_{ij},   (\#eq:eqRCBD)$$

where $i=1,\ldots,c$ and $j=1,\ldots,r$ are indices for levels of the
two factors $C$ and $R$, $\mu$ represents the overall mean of the
outcome $y_{ij}$, and the $\tau_i$ and $\beta_j$ terms quantify the
effects of factors $C$ and $R$. The errors are frequently assumed
independent and identically normally distributed, with constant error
variance $\sigma^2$. Since data from these designs are easy to display
using two-way tables, frequently the levels of factors $R$ and $C$ are
called \"rows\" and \"columns,\" respectively. In this report (and the
[*hiddenf*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=hiddenf) manual), Factor
$R$ is referred to as the \"row\" or \"grouped\" factor, while factor
$C$ is called the \"column\" factor.\
Model (\@ref(eq:eqRCBD)) assumes that the effect of the row factor on
the response $y_{ij}$ does not depend on the level of the column factor,
and vice versa. In statistical parlance this is known as the assumption
of \"additivity.\" This assumption is sometimes made out of necessity as
the alternative of including the interaction term from the full
factorial effects model precludes statistical inference. After computing
the interaction mean square, zero degrees of freedom remain with which
to estimate the error variance, $\sigma^2$. Data arising from
(\@ref(eq:eqRCBD)) are shown in Figure [1](#Figure1) panel A.\
If the effect of factor $C$ varies across levels of the factor $R$, then
there is statistical interaction. In this case (\@ref(eq:eqRCBD)) is
misspecified. Graphical assessment of additivity is commonly made using
an interaction plot. Figure [1](#Figure1) panel B is an interaction plot
for the `cjejuni.mtx` data set included in the *hiddenf* package
[@yucanqiu].\

![Figure 1: Interaction plots. Lines correspond to levels of factor $R$
and tick marks on the horizontal axis correspond to levels of factor
$C$. Panel A is simulated data from (\@ref(eq:eqRCBD)). These data do
not exhibit statistical interaction so departure from parallel lines is
due to random noise. Panel B is `cjejuni.mtx` data, which visually
exhibit non-additivity.](Figure1.png){#Figure1 width="100.0%"
style="text-align: center" alt="graphic without alt text"}

Since the data in Figure [1](#Figure1) panel B do not exhibit
parallelism, there is graphical evidence to suggest that
(\@ref(eq:eqRCBD)) may not be a suitable model. This is problematic
because inferences conducted under (\@ref(eq:eqRCBD)) will be incorrect
if (\@ref(eq:eqRCBD)) fails to describe the true nature of the variables
under investigation. Fortunately, many methods have been devised to
assess non-additivity in these designs, including those in [@Tukey],
[@Anscombe], [@Mandel1], [@Mandel2], [@JohnsonD], [@Hirotsu], [@KKSA],
[@Tusell], [@Boik], [@Franck], and [@Malik]. [@Alin] provide a review of
methods available up to 2006. We return to the analysis of these and
other data in subsequent sections of the paper.\
Despite the wide usage of unreplicated two-way designs, computational
tools to assess non-additivity are lacking, particularly for more recent
methods. Currently, the
[*additivityTests*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=additivityTests)
package [@Simecek] provides test statistics, critical thresholds, and
binary reject/fail to reject decisions for tests proposed in [@Tukey],
[@Mandel1], [@Boik], [@Tusell], [@JohnsonD], and [@Simecek]. The
*additivityTests* package does not produce p-values.

# The *hiddenf* package {#Package}

This paper describes the R package *hiddenf*, which makes available
several tools for the analysis of non-additivity in unreplicated two-way
layouts. This package contributes to available computational resources
by (a) providing statistical and graphical diagnostic tools within the
context of hidden additivity that enable the user to go beyond overall
tests of additivity towards the inferential goal of characterizing and
quantifying the magnitude of interaction, and (b) providing p-value
computations for five methods to detect non-additivity. Supported tests
include those proposed in [@Tukey], [@Mandel1], [@KKSA], [@Franck], and
[@Malik]. The latter three are newly available in an open-source
repository via the *hiddenf* package, which is available from the
Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN).\
Hidden additivity occurs when the levels of factor $R$ fall into a
smaller number of groups, such that within these groups the effect of
factor $C$ is constant across levels of factor $R$, but there is
$C \times group$ interaction [@Franck]. Group membership of levels of
$R$ can be regarded as latent, unobservable random variables. Inspection
of Figure [1](#Figure1) panel B provides an example. If one group is
formed from the two lines (processing plants) that reach their peak in
year 3, and another from the two lines that reach their peak in year 4,
then the year and plant effects are roughly additive within these
groups.\
The `HiddenF()` function accepts an $r \times c$ data matrix as input
and returns an object of the *HiddenF* class. Objects of this class
store the p-value from the all-configurations maximum interaction F
(ACMIF) test [@Franck] for hidden additivity, the number of
configurations under consideration, the configuration that achieves the
maximum interaction F score (or maximum hidden additivity), and the data
as a list. Several generic functions, including `print()`, `anova()`,
`summary()` and `plot()`, can be applied to objects of the *HiddenF*
class to produce output useful for the quantification and
characterization of interaction. By default, the `HiddenF()` function
considers the row factor as the variable to group. Submitting a
transposed matrix executes the grouping on the column variable. Deciding
which factor to group is subjective, and can be approached using domain
knowledge or a trial-and-error approach. Figure [2](#flowchart)
summarizes the functionality of the *hiddenf* package.\

![Figure 2: Flowchart of *hiddenf* functionality. The user supplies a
$r \times c$ data matrix to the `HiddenF()` function, which returns an
object of the *HiddenF* class. The user can then characterize hidden
additivity and obtain p-values for tests of
non-additivity.](Pub_flow_chart.png){#flowchart width="100%"

The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. The *C. jejuni* data
are first described as a relevant example. The following section reviews
the testing procedure for hidden additivity. Functionality to detect
hidden additivity using *hiddenf* is then detailed. Four other supported
methods to detect non-additivity are then reviewed. Seventeen data sets
are described and explored using the methods supported by *hiddenf*. The
article concludes with a summary.

# Example {#Example}

We now return to the data from Figure [1](#Figure1) panel B. The
vertical axis in this plot is the proportion of disease-resistant
bacteria samples of the *C. jejuni* strain taken from turkey processing
facilities. These data were collected over a five year period across
four processing plants in North Carolina. Each line corresponds to a
plant, and the year labels correspond to 2008-2012. The matrix
`cjejuni.mtx` contains the fractions of bacteria that are classified as
the strain *C. jejuni*.\

# Testing for hidden additivity {#HA}

Hidden additivity is a useful concept for the analysis of many types of
data because the structure is easy to visualize and interpret. The ACMIF
test [@Franck] to detect hidden additivity assigns classical
significance testing-based p-values. A combined testing and plotting
approach allows the researcher to interpret the way in which column
effects change across groups of the rows.\
The ACMIF test works by (1) considering each placement of factor $R$
levels into two nonempty groups, (2) testing factor $C \times group$
interaction, and (3) considering the test that provides the most
evidence of interaction (and greatest additivity of $C$ and $R$ within
groups) after correcting for multiplicity using a Bonferroni adjustment.
Simulation suggests that the Bonferroni correction is not overly
conservative for $r \leq 7$ despite the magnitude of the correction
factor $2^{r-1}-1$, because the Bonferroni adjusted thresholds are
remarkably similar to simulated critical thresholds for a variety of $c$
and $r$ values [@Franck]. If $g$ is an index for the latent group
membership such that $g=1,2$, then the factorial effects model
corresponding to the hidden additivity structure is given by

$$\label{eq:groupmod}
  y_{ij}^g = \mu + \tau_i + \gamma_g + (\tau\gamma)_{ig} + \beta_{j(g)} + \epsilon_{ijg} \\   (\#eq:eqgroupmod)$$

where $\mu$ is the overall mean, $\tau_i$ and $\gamma_g$ are the main
effects of factor $C$ and the grouping variable, $(\tau\gamma)_{ig}$
represents factor $C \times group$ interaction, and $\beta_{j(g)}$ is
the effect of factor $R$, nested within group. The ACMIF test is based
on the largest $F$-ratio corresponding to $H_0: (\tau\gamma)_{ig} = 0$
among all assignments of $R$ factor levels into two non-empty groups.

# Characterizing hidden additivity {#CHA}

Objects in the *HiddenF* class can be used to characterize hidden
additivity further with application of the generic `plot()`, `print()`,
`summary()`, and `anova()` functions. The following code produces an
enhanced interaction plot to help visualize hidden additivity (Figure
[3](#hiddenfplotcj)):\

``` r
> cjejuni.out <-HiddenF(cjejuni.mtx)
> plot(cjejuni.out, main="Hidden Additivity of time effects across plants",
+ rfactor="plant", cfactor="year", colorvec=c("blue", "red"), lwd=3, legendx=TRUE)
```

![Figure 3: Hidden additivity plot for the `cjejuni.mtx` data. Lines are
color-coded to correspond to the configuration that achieves the maximal
$C \times group$ interaction $F$ statistic. Individual rows are
distinguished by line type to allow the user to easily identify specific
contributions of rows to hidden additivity
.](Figure_3_final.png){#hiddenfplotcj width="100%"
style="text-align: center" alt="graphic without alt text"}

The enhanced interaction plot in Figure [3](#hiddenfplotcj) displays
levels of factor $C$ (year) on the horizontal axis, levels of factor $R$
(plant) using lines that are visually distinguished by line type, and
the outcome values on the vertical axis. Color is used to display which
levels of factor $R$ are assigned to which groups based on the maximal
interaction $F$ statistic among all possible configurations and
(\@ref(eq:eqgroupmod)). Note that the grouping colors appear whether or
not the ACMIF p-value (test for $C \times group$) to detect hidden
additivity is significant. The default colors are black and red for the
two groups, but they can be customized by supplying an argument called
`colorvec` which is a vector of length two giving color names. Another
optional argument, `legendx`, may be set to `TRUE` in order to provide a
legend whose location will be determined according to where on the plot
the user clicks.\
Because of the ellipsis(...), arguments such as `main` (for a title) or
`lwd` (for specifying line widths) can be passed to `matplot` or
`legend`. The arguments `lty`, `type`, `ylab`, and `xlab` are utilized
by the `plot.HiddenF()` function to produce the enhanced interaction
plot and therefore are not available for customization by the user.

The `print()` function returns results from the ACMIF test.\

``` r
> print(cjejuni.out)
The ACMIF test for the hidden additivity form of interaction
F=8.965 p-value =0.03309 df=4,8
(Bonferroni-adjusted for all 7 possible configurations) 
```

This output can also be obtained by typing the name of an object of
class *HiddenF* into the console. The $p$-value above has been adjusted
for multiplicity using the Bonferroni multiplier of $2^{4-1}-1=7$.
Additionally, the `method` argument in the `print.HiddenF()` function
supports all of the methods supported by the *hiddenf* package discussed
later. To see which of these seven possible configurations of rows in
two non-empty groups leads to the greatest additivity within groups, use
the generic `summary()` function, which returns information useful for
analysis based on (\@ref(eq:eqgroupmod)):\

``` r
> summary(cjejuni.out)
Number of configurations: 7 
Minimum adjusted pvalue: 0.03308869 

Rows in group 1: 1 3 
Rows in group 2: 2 4 

Column means for grp 1: 0.16 0.08 0.5 0.16 0.18 
Column means for grp 2: 0.14 0.13 0.185 0.485 0.145 
```

The output above includes the number of configurations under
consideration, the smallest Bonferroni adjusted p-value among these, the
identity of the rows that fall into each group and the means across
levels of $C$ for both groups. Each of these items is returned in a list
(not shown). To produce an ANOVA table:

``` r
> anova(cjejuni.out)
The ACMIF test for the hidden additivity form of interaction
Analysis of Variance Table

Response: y
          Df  Sum Sq  Mean Sq F value   Pr(>F)
group      1 0.00000 0.000005  0.0009 0.977350
col        4 0.18753 0.046882  8.0450 0.006606
row        2 0.03673 0.018365  3.1514 0.097874

C.Total   19 0.47986                          
(Pvalues in ANOVA table are NOT corrected for multiplicity.)
```

For these data, the interaction between time (`col`) and plant group
(`group`) accounts for more variability ($43\%$) than any other term in
the hidden additivity model. This partial coefficient of determination
is computed by dividing the group $\times$ column sums of squares by the
total sum of squares displayed above. The anova() function can also
accommodate other tests for non-additivity by specifying the `method`
argument as \"KKSA\", \"Mandel\" or \"Tukey\" (see Other Tests for
Non-additivity section).\
Levels of factor $C$ can be grouped instead by transposing the input
data matrix before applying the `HiddenF()` function. The output below
suggests no statistical evidence for hidden additivity in the levels of
factor $C$.

``` r
> cjejuni.trans.mtx<-t(cjejuni.mtx)
> cjejuni.trans.out<-HiddenF(cjejuni.trans.mtx)
> print(cjejuni.trans.out)
The ACMIF test for the hidden additivity form of interaction
F=3.63 p-value =0.8671 df=3,9
(Bonferroni-adjusted for all 15 possible configurations)
```

Note that support for more than 20 rows is not yet included due to the
exponential increase in computational demand as the number of grouped
levels increases. Factors with more levels than this will be
accommodated in future versions of the software.

## Centering

The `center` option in the plot command allows the user to graph the
hidden additivity plot with data centered at the row means to better see
the concordance of rows with regard to column effects. This is a way of
de-noising the plot. Figure [4](#Graybillplot) demonstrates this feature
using data from [@Graybillex]. These data will be further analyzed
later. Inspection of the right panel of Figure [4](#Graybillplot)
suggests that the third genotype appears to give inferior yields for
rows in the red group (relative to the performance of other genotypes in
these blocks), but does better for rows colored black. To produce this
plot:\

``` r
> data(Graybill.mtx)
> Graybill.out <- HiddenF(Graybill.mtx)
> par(mfrow=c(1,2))
> plot(Graybill.out)
> plot(Graybill.out, center=TRUE, main="Hidden Additivity plot\ncenter=TRUE")
```

![Figure 4: Hidden additivity plots for the wheat yield data
[@Graybillex]. The left and right panels exhibit the uncentered and
centered graphical options,
respectively.](./Figure4rev.png){#Graybillplot width="100.0%"
style="text-align: center" alt="graphic without alt text"}

# Other tests for non-additivity

The ACMIF approach [@Franck] to detect hidden additivity has been
described above. The subsections below include code examples and briefly
review the other four supported approaches to detect non-additivity in
unreplicated studies.

## One degree of freedom approach {#Tukapproach}

The one degree of freedom test [@Tukey] is the earliest and most
widely-known approach. The following model for non-additivity
corresponds to Tukey's procedure:

$$\label{eq:tukmod}
y_{ij}=\mu + \tau_i + \beta_j + \nu\tau_i\beta_j + \epsilon_{ij}.   (\#eq:eqtukmod)$$

A hypothesis test for this approach is based on the null hypothesis
$H_0:\nu=0$. Under the null, (\@ref(eq:eqtukmod)) reduces to
(\@ref(eq:eqRCBD)). The one degree of freedom test arises by fitting the
squared fitted values from the additive model as a model term, then
assessing the partial F-test for statistical significance corresponding
to this term.\
The `TukeyPvalue()` function accepts an object of class *HiddenF* and
returns a list that contains the p-value for the one degree of freedom
test and an *lm* object that contains the model that includes the
squared predictions from (\@ref(eq:eqRCBD)) as described above. The
`method` argument in the `anova.HiddenF()` function can be used to
produce an ANOVA table for this test. Since the p-value is large, the
output below does not provide statistical evidence for non-additivity of
the form suggested in (\@ref(eq:eqtukmod)).

``` r
> TukeyPvalue(cjejuni.out)
$pvalue
[1] 0.7077391

$singledf.out

Call:
lm(formula = y ~ rows + cols + psq, data = hfobj$tall)

(Intercept)        rows2        rows3        rows4        cols2        cols3

   0.044568   0.006369     1.569601
```

## Rows-linear approach {#RLapproach}

An extension of the one degree of freedom test is based on the following
model [@Mandel1]:

$$\label{eq:mandelmod}
y_{ij}=\mu + \tau_i + \beta_j + \theta_i\beta_j + \epsilon_{ij},   (\#eq:eqmandelmod)$$

where $\epsilon_{ij}$ are i.i.d. $N(0,\sigma^2)$. The test for
rows-linear non-additivity is based on the null hypothesis
$H_0: \theta_i = 0$ for $i=1,\ldots, t$. Under this null,
(\@ref(eq:eqmandelmod)) reduces to (\@ref(eq:eqRCBD)).\
By setting $\mu_i = \mu + \tau_i$ and $\theta_i = (\phi_i-1)$, the
response variable $y_{ij}$ in (\@ref(eq:eqmandelmod)) can be represented
as an intercept $\mu_i$ and slope $\phi_i$ that depend on effect
$\beta_j$. Letting $i$ and $j$ index \"rows\" and \"columns\"
respectively leads to the phrase \"rows-linear\" model, which was
established later [see @Alin].\
The ANOVA table sum of squares associated with the $\theta_i$ term is

$$SS_{rowlin}=\sum_i( \frac{\sum_j y_{ij}(\bar{y}_{.j}-\bar{y}_{..})}{\sum_j(\bar{y}_{.j}-\bar{y}_{..})^2} -1 )^2 \sum_j(\bar{y}_{.j}-\bar{y}_{..})^2.$$

The residual sum of squares has the following form:

$$SS_{res}=\sum_i \sum_j  [(y_{ij}-\bar{y}_{i.}) - \frac{\sum_j y_{ij}(\bar{y}_{.j}-\bar{y}_{..})}{\sum_j(\bar{y}_{.j}-\bar{y}_{..})^2}(\bar{y}_{.j}-\bar{y}_{..})  ]^2.$$

The test statistic is:

$$F_{rowlin} = \frac{SS_{rowlin}/(a-1)}{SS_{res}/(a-1)(b-2)}.$$

The statistic $F_{rowlin}$ has an $F$ distribution with $(a-1)$
numerator and $(a-1)(b-2)$ denominator degrees of freedom under the null
hypothesis. Construction of a columns-linear test is accomplished by
defining a *HiddenF* object on the transposed data matrix and calling
the `MandelPvalue()` in a similar fashion.\
The `MandelPvalue()` function accepts an object of class *HiddenF* and
returns a list that includes a p-value, sums of squares, F ratio, and
degrees of freedom for the rows-linear test. The output below fails to
detect interaction using Mandel's rows-linear test:

``` r
> MandelPvalue(cjejuni.out)
$pvalue
[1] 0.9458807

$SumSq
      SSRow       SSCol    SSMandel         SSE       SSTot 
0.036735000 0.187530000 0.009849526 0.245740474 0.479855000 

$Fratio
[1] 0.120243

$df
[1] 3 9
```

## Error mean square subtable comparison approach {#KKSAapproach}

The error mean square (MSE) subtable comparison approach [@KKSA] forms
an $F$ statistic that is the ratio of residual sums of squares that
arise from rows being placed into two groups, with each group containing
at least two rows,

$$F_{KKSA} = \frac{(r_2-1)SS_{E1}}{(r_1-1)SS_{E2}}.$$

Under the assumptions of additivity and homogeneous variance, $F_{KKSA}$
has an $F$ distribution with $(r_1-1)(c-1)$ numerator and $(r_2-1)(c-1)$
denominator degrees of freedom under the null hypothesis, no matter
which rows are placed into which group. This approach suggests
non-additivity when error mean square values within the subtables are
discrepant.\
As with the ACMIF procedure, grouping is subjective and is accomplished
by choosing one of the two factors upon which to form the groups, and
then placing that factor's levels into two groups. Different groupings
result in different p-values. Groups are typically chosen based on *a
priori* knowledge, inspection of an interaction plot, or by screening
several candidate groupings and applying multiplicity adjustment to the
resulting p-values. The *hiddenf* package adopts the authors' [@KKSA]
suggestion of assessing the $2^{r-1}-r-1$ possible groupings for factor
$R$ and Bonferroni adjusting the resulting p-values to achieve an
$\alpha$ level test.\
The `KKSAPvalue()` function accepts an object of class *HiddenF* and
returns a list that contains the maximal $F$ statistic among
configurations, a Bonferroni adjusted p-value, a length $r$ vector that
indicates the groupings of levels of factor $R$ that correspond to the
calculated p-value, and numerator and denominator degrees of freedom for
the test statistic. Data may be transposed in order to form subtables
according to factor $C$. At significance level $\alpha=.05$ the output
below does not reject the null hypothesis of additivity according to the
MSE subtable comparison approach when grouping levels of factor $R$.\

``` r
> t(KKSAPvalue(cjejuni.out))
         fmax     pvalue  grp.vector   NumDf DenomDf
[1,]   1.748821     1     Numeric,4      4     4      
```

## Residual clustering approach

A recent approach [@Malik] considers non-additivity elicited due to cell
values which are remote relative to the additive model. Not all cells
are assumed to contribute to the interaction pattern. The method detects
non-additivity by exploiting the large residuals that arise under this
structure.\
Execution of the residual clustering method proceeds as follows. First,
residuals from (\@ref(eq:eqRCBD))
$\hat{r}_{ij(1)} = y_{ij} - \hat{y}_{ij(1)}$ are placed into 3 groups
using k-means clustering [@MacQueen] in one dimension. Then, a two
degrees of freedom cluster effect is incorporated into the additive
model:

$$y_{ij}=\mu + \tau_i + \beta_j + \kappa_{k(ij)} + \epsilon_{ij}$$

where $\kappa_{k(ij)}$ represents the effect of the $kth$ cluster,
$k=1,2,3$. The subscript $k(ij)$ indicates that the $ijth$ residual is
assigned to exactly one of the $k$ clusters for $i=1,\ldots,c$ and
$j=1,\ldots,r$. Since the cluster term is suggested by the data, the
partial $F$ test corresponding to the cluster term does *not* exhibit a
central $F$ distribution under the null. Rather, the null distribution
for this statistic may be approximated via Monte Carlo simulation for
the purpose of conducting statistical inference. Critical thresholds for
a variety of $c$ and $r$ are available [@Malik]. The *hiddenf* package
computes p-values and critical thresholds for user-supplied $c$ and $r$
using the functions `MalikPvalue` and `MalikTab`, respectively. By
default $N=500$ Monte Carlo replicates are used to approximate the
p-value, which guarantees the standard error of the p-value
$SE(p-value) \leq 0.023$.\
The `MalikPvalue` function accepts an object of class *HiddenF* and
returns a Monte Carlo p-value, observed test statistic, and Monte Carlo
sample size used in the computation. The k-means approach uses the
method of [@HartiganWong] with 100 starting values per Monte Carlo
iteration. The output below suggests that the *C. jejuni* data do not
exhibit non-additivity of the form suggested by this method. This
approach is invariant to data transposition.\

``` r
> t(MalikPvalue(cjejuni.out, N=10000))
(Pvalue from Malik's test estimated with N=10000 Monte Carlo datasets) 
     pvalue    Tc      N    
[1,] 0.8498 40.97983 10000
```

The *MalikTab* function accepts as input a user-specified $r$ and $c$,
and returns a Monte Carlo estimate of the 90%, 95%, and 99% for the null
distribution of the test statistic. A variety of such thresholds are
provided in [@Malik]. The default number of Monte Carlo replicates is
$N=1,000$. An example is given below.

``` r
> Mtab.24.6<-MalikTab(r=24, c=6, N=10000)
> ls(Mtab.24.6)
[1] "q"     "Tcsim"
> Mtab.24.6\$q
      r        c      99%      95%      90% 
 24.0000   6.0000 445.5725 404.3399 384.0591
```

## The `additivityPvalues` function

The `additivityPvalues` function accepts an object of class *HiddenF*
and returns p-values for each of the supported methods.

``` r
> t(additivityPvalues(cjejuni.out))
(Pvalue from Malik's test estimated with N=500 Monte Carlo datasets) 
     Malik.pvalue Mandel.pvalue Tukey.pvalue KKSA.pvalue ACMIF.pvalue
[1,]    0.834        0.9459       0.7077           1       0.0331      
```

# Data examples {#DE}

Table 1 summarizes an investigation of 17 data sets using the methods
supported by *hiddenf*. These examples are taken from bioinformatic,
agricultural, industrial, and medical settings, and are all publicly
available. To our knowledge, this is the largest collection and
description of data that has been used to study non-additivity in the
literature to date. Table 1 includes columns for references, labels, and
p-values. Note that ACMIF c, columns-linear, and KKSA c are obtained by
submitting the transposed data matrix to `HiddenF()`. A brief
description of each data set follows.\
The \"Liming\" data arises from an experiment that explores the utility
of seven types of blast furnace slags as liming material in agriculture
on three types of soil [@Carter]. The data were analyzed in the context
of non-additivity in [@JohnsonD] and [@KKSA]. The outcome variable is
yields of corn in bushels per acre.\
The \"Penicillin\" data set [@Davies] assesses variability between six
samples of penicillin on 24 plates. The outcome variable is the diameter
of the zone of inhibition. The data were analyzed for non-additivity in
[@Malik].\
The \"Osmotic\" data set [@KKSA] explores five varieties of safflower
grown in solutions with six osmotic potentials. Safflowers are an
important crop due to their oil which can be used for cooking and their
flowers which can be used as a substitute for saffron. The outcome
variable is average root weight.\
The \"Fertilizer\" example originally appeared in [@Ostle] and was
re-analyzed to detect non-additivity in [@KKSA]. This example explores
the ratio of dry to wet wheat in four blocks for four fertilizers.\
 

The \"Bottles\" example was originally analyzed in [@OttSnee] and also
explored in [@Boik2] and [@KKSA]. The study assesses the performance of
a six-headed machine on five occasions.\
The \"Grain Yields\" data measures the yield of a grain crop in bushels
per acre for five levels of fertilizer on five blocks. The data come
from [@Ostle] and are re-analyzed in [@KKSA].\
The \"Absorbance\" data [@Mandel3] measures absorbancy of wood pulp of
nine polysachharide concentrations from seven different laboratories.
The data are also analyzed in [@Alin].\
The \"Permeability\" example examines permeability of three sheets of
building material on nine different days. The data appear in [@Hald] and
[@GiesGump].\
The \"Wool\" data [@Lentner] examines four cleaning processes for wool
from five different batches. The outcome is losses in weight in $mg$ of
the sample after cleaning.\
The \"Red Blood Cells\" data measures the number of red blood cells
counted by five doctors in ten counting chambers. The data appear in
[@Biggs] and were also analyzed in [@Boik].\
The \"Tukey\" data set is an illustrative example that includes three
rows and four columns from [@Tukey].\
The \"Ethyl Alcohol\" data [@OsborneNS] measures the density of aqueous
solutions of ethyl alcohol at six concentrations and seven temperatures.
These data were also analyzed in [@Mandel2].\
The \"Insecticide\" data [@OttLongnecker] comes from a complete block
design that measures the impact of four plots and three insecticides on
the number of string bean seedlings that emerge.\
The \"Rubber\" data [@Mandel1] contains data on stress measurements in
$Kg/cm^2$ on seven types of natural rubber vulcanizates from 11
laboratories.\
The \"*C. jejuni*\" data measures the fraction of bacteria found on
disease-resistant turkeys [@yucanqiu]. These data were collected over a
five year period across four turkey plants in North Carolina. These data
are displayed in Figures [1](#Figure1) and [3](#hiddenfplotcj).\
The \"Wheat\" data [@Graybillex] measures wheat yields in bushels per
acre in four varieties in 13 locations. These data are plotted in Figure
[4](#Graybillplot).\
The eight Copy number variation data sets \"CNV1-CNV8\" compare
discrepancies in the copy number signal between normal and tumor tissue
samples from a comparative genomic hybridization array. Each data set
corresponds to a separate location in the genome that is tested with the
assay. Six dogs each had two tissue samples (one normal and one tumor)
upon which the assay was conducted. The eight specific sets were
selected from 5899 sets that were analyzed in a previous study and
because they showed evidence of hidden additivity [@Franck]. The hidden
additivity exhibited in these copy number responses might suggest the
existence of multiple tumor sub-types for lymphoma in dogs. The full
data for this example may be accessed here:
<http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167947313001618>.

The results of non-additivity tests using methods supported by the
*hiddenf* package are reported in Table 1. The data come from 17
sources, and there are 24 total sets with the copy number variation
contributing eight individual sets. This collection is not intended as a
representative sample of the larger class of all unreplicated two-factor
data, since many sets were included due to their apparent
non-additivity. This exercise is intended to show the breadth of
applications for which the study of non-additivity is important. To
facilitate discussion, the standard p-value less than $\alpha=0.05$
criterion is used to declare statistical significance without further
multiplicity correction, although the reader is invited to interpret the
raw p-values however they like. The ACMIF test for hidden additivity was
significant for 16 of 24 sets when grouping levels of factor $R$. The
test was significant for eight of 16 sets when grouping levels of factor
$C$. The Tukey test was significant for eight of 24 sets. The
rows-linear and columns-linear tests showed significant non-additivity
for seven and six sets (out of 16 possible), respectively. The KKSA test
grouping levels of $R$ and $C$ revealed non-additivity for 13 of 22 and
five of 13 sets, respectively. The Malik approach yielded significant
non-additivity for nine of 24 sets. Since all tests assume different
restrictions on the form of interaction, no single test is optimal for
every conceivable pattern. Hence, differential performance among methods
is expected for different types of data. Each test excels at detecting
different patterns of non-additivity.

# Summary {#conclude}

This paper describes the main functionality of the *hiddenf* package.
*hiddenf* provides descriptive and inferential tools to visualize and
characterize hidden additivity. Further, *hiddenf* includes the ability
to compute p-values for five tests for non-additivity. The package is
illustrated using seventeen data sets spanning studies in industrial
applications, agriculture, and the medical sciences. Non-additivity is
evident in many of these data sets, motivating the importance of
statistical interaction in unreplicated studies across a variety of
scientific domains. The *hiddenf* package contributes to existing
software resources specifically by making three recent tests for
non-additivity available in an open-source repository for the first time
(in addition to two historical methods) and by providing visualization
and descriptive tools to further explore hidden additivity.
