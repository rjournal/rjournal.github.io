title: Exploring Interaction Effects in Two-Factor Studies using the hiddenf Package
  in R.
abstract: In crossed, two-factor studies with one observation per factor-level combination,
  interaction effects between factors can be hard to detect and can make the choice
  of a suitable statistical model difficult. This article describes hiddenf, an R
  package that enables users to quantify and characterize a certain form of interaction
  in two-factor layouts. When effects of one factor (a) fall into two groups depending
  on the level of another factor, and (b) are constant within these groups, the interaction
  pattern is deemed "hidden additivity" because within groups, the effects of the
  two factors are additive, while between groups the factors are allowed to interact.
  The hiddenf software can be used to estimate, test, and report an appropriate factorial
  effects model corresponding to hidden additivity, which is intermediate between
  the unavailable full factorial model and the overly-simplistic additive model. Further,
  the software also conducts five statistical tests for interaction proposed between
  1949 and 2014. A collection of 17 datasets is used for illustration.
