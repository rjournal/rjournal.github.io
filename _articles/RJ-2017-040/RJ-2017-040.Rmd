title: 'dGAselID: An R Package for Selecting a Variable Number of Features in High
  Dimensional Data'
abstract: The dGAselID package proposes an original approach to feature selection
  in high dimen sional data. The method is built upon a diploid genetic algorithm.
  The genotype to phenotype mapping is modeled after the Incomplete Dominance Inheritance,
  overpassing the necessity to define a dominance scheme. The fitness evaluation is
  done by user selectable supervised classifiers, from a broad range of options. Cross
  validation options are also accessible. A new approach to crossover, inspired from
  the random assortment of chromosomes during meiosis is included. Several mutation
  operators, inspired from genetics, are also proposed. The package is fully compatible
  with the data formats used in Bioconductor and MLInterfaces package, readily applicable
  to microarray studies, but is flexible to other feature selection applications from
  high dimensional data. Several options for the visualization of evolution and outcomes
  are implemented to facilitate the interpretation of results. The package’s functionality
  is illustrated by examples.
