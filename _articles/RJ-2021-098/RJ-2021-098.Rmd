title: 'EMSS: New EM-type algorithms for the Heckman selection model in R'
abstract: 'When investigators observe non-random samples from populations, sample
  selectivity problems may occur. The Heckman selection model is widely used to deal
  with selectivity problems. Based on the EM algorithm, Zhao et al. (2020) developed
  three algorithms, namely, ECM, ECM(NR), and ECME(NR), which also have the EM algorithm’s
  main advantages: stability and ease of imple mentation. This paper provides the
  implementation of these three new EM-type algorithms in the package EMSS and illustrates
  the usage of the package on several simulated and real data examples. The comparison
  between the maximum likelihood estimation method (MLE) and three new EM-type algorithms
  in robustness issues is further discussed.'
