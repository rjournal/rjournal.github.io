title: 'rpostgis: Linking R with a PostGIS Spatial Database'
abstract: With the proliferation of sensors and the ease of data collection from online
  sources, large datasets have become the norm in many scientific disciplines, and
  efficient data storage, management, and retrival is imperative for large research
  projects. Relational databases provide a solution, but in order to be useful, must
  be able to be linked to analysis and visualization tools, such as R. Here, we present
  a package intended to facilitate integration of R with the open-source database
  software PostgreSQL, with a focus on its spatial extension, PostGIS. The package
  rpostgis (version 1.4.1) provides methods for spatial data handling (vector and
  raster) between PostGIS-enabled databases and R, methods for R "data.frame"s storage
  in PostgreSQL, and a set of convenient wrappers for common database procedures.
  We thus expect rpostgis to be useful for both (1) existing users of spatial data
  in R and/or PostGIS, and (2) R users who have yet to adopt relational databases
  for their projects.
