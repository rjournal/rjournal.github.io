title: Computing Pareto Frontiers and Database Preferences with the rPref Package
abstract: The concept of Pareto frontiers is well-known in economics. Within the database
  community there exist many different solutions for the specification and calculation
  of Pareto frontiers, also called Skyline queries in the database context. Slight
  generalizations like the combination of the Pareto operator with the lexicographical
  order have been established under the term database preferences. In this paper we
  present the rPref package which allows to efficiently deal with these concepts within
  R. With its help, database preferences can be specified in a very similar way as
  in a state-of-the-art database management system. Our package provides algorithms
  for an efficient calculation of the Pareto-optimal set and further functionalities
  for visualizing and analyzing the induced preference order.
