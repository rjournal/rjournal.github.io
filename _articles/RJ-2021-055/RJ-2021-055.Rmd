title: 'distr6: R6 Object-Oriented Probability Distributions Interface in R'
abstract: distr6 is an object-oriented (OO) probability distributions interface leveraging
  the extensibility and scalability of R6 and the speed and efficiency of Rcpp. Over
  50 probability distributions are currently implemented in the package with 'core'
  methods, including density, distribution, and generating functions, and more 'exotic'
  ones, including hazards and distribution function anti-derivatives. In addition
  to simple distributions, distr6 supports compositions such as truncation, mixtures,
  and product distributions. This paper presents the core functionality of the package
  and demonstrates examples for key use-cases. In addition, this paper provides a
  critical review of the object-oriented programming paradigms in R and describes
  some novel implementations for design patterns and core object-oriented features
  introduced by the package for supporting distr6 components.
