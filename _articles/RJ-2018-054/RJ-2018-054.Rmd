title: 'rcss: R package for optimal convex stochastic switching'
abstract: The R package rcss provides users with a tool to approximate the value functions
  in the Bellman recursion under certain assumptions that guarantee desirable convergence
  properties. This R package represents the first software implementation of these
  methods using matrices and nearest neighbors. This package also employs a pathwise
  dynamic method to gauge the quality of these value function approximations. Statistical
  analysis can be performed on the results to obtain other useful practical insights.
  This paper describes rcss version 1.6.
