title: Collaborative Software Development Using R-Forge
abstract: 'Open source software (OSS) is typically created in a decentralized self-organizing
  process by a community of developers having the same or similar interests (see the
  famous essay by ?). A key factor for the success of OSS over the last two decades
  is the Internet: Developers who rarely meet face-to-face can employ new means of
  communication, both for rapidly writing and deploying software (in the spirit of
  Linus Torvald’s “release early, release often paradigm”). Therefore, many tools
  emerged that assist a collaborative software development process, including in particular
  tools for source code management (SCM) and version control.'
