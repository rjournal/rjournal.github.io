# Introduction {#introduction .unnumbered}

Open source software (OSS) is typically created in a decentralized
self-organizing process by a community of developers having the same or
similar interests [see the famous essay by @forge:Raymond:1999]. A key
factor for the success of OSS over the last two decades is the Internet:
Developers who rarely meet face-to-face can employ new means of
communication, both for rapidly writing and deploying software (in the
spirit of Linus Torvald's "release early, release often paradigm").
Therefore, many tools emerged that assist a collaborative software
development process, including in particular tools for source code
management (SCM) and version control.

In the R world, SCM is not a new idea; in fact, the R Development Core
Team has always been using SCM tools for the R sources, first by means
of Concurrent Versions System [CVS, see @forge:Cederqvist:2006], and
then via Subversion [SVN, see
@forge:Pilato+Collins-Sussman+Fitzpatrick:2004]. A central repository is
hosted by ETH Zürich mainly for managing the development of the base R
system. Mailing lists like R-help, R-devel and many others are currently
the main communication channels in the R community.

Also beyond the base system, many R contributors employ SCM tools for
managing their R packages, e.g., via web-based SVN repositories like
SourceForge (<http://SourceForge.net/>) or Google Code
(<http://Code.Google.com/>). However, there has been no central SCM
repository providing services suited to the specific needs of R package
developers. Since early 2007, the R-project offers such a central
platform to the R community. R-Forge (<http://R-Forge.R-project.org/>)
provides a set of tools for source code management and various web-based
features. It aims to provide a platform for collaborative development of
R packages, R-related software or further projects. R-Forge is closely
related to the most famous of such platforms---the world's largest OSS
development website---namely <http://SourceForge.net/>.

The remainder of this article is organized as follows. First, we present
the core features that R-Forge offers to the R community. Second, we
give a hands-on tutorial on how users and developers can get started
with R-Forge. In particular, we illustrate how people can register, set
up new projects, use R-Forge's SCM facilities, provide their packages on
R-Forge, host a project-specific website, and how package maintainers
submit a package to the Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN,
<http://CRAN.R-project.org/>). Finally, we summarize recent developments
and give a brief outlook to future work.

# R-Forge

R-Forge offers a central platform for the development of R packages,
R-related software and other projects.

R-Forge is based on GForge [@forge:copeland_et_al:2006] which is an open
source fork of the 2.61 SourceForge code maintained by Tim Perdue, one
of the original SourceForge authors. GForge has been modified to provide
additional features for the R community, namely a CRAN-style repository
for hosting development releases of R packages as well as a quality
management system similar to that of CRAN. Packages hosted on R-Forge
are provided in source form as well as in binary form for Mac OS X and
Windows. They can be downloaded from the website of the corresponding
project on R-Forge or installed directly in R; for a package *foo*, say,
`install.packages("foo", repos = "http://R-Forge.R-project.org")`.

On R-Forge, developers organize their work in so-called "Projects".
Every project has various tools and web-based features for software
development, communcation and other services. All features mentioned in
the following sections are accessible via so-called "Tabs": e.g., user
accounts can be managed in the *My Page* tab or a list of available
projects can be displayed using the *Project Tree* tab.

Since starting the platform in early 2007, more and more interested
users registered their projects on R-Forge. Now, after more than two
years of development and testing, around 350 projects and more than 900
users are registered on R-Forge. This and the steadily growing list of
feature requests show that there is a high demand for centralized source
code management tools and for releasing prototype code frequently among
the R community.

In the next three sections, we summarize the core features of R-Forge
and what R-Forge offers to the R community in terms of collaborative
development of R-related software projects.

## Source code management

When carrying out software projects, source files change over time, new
files get created and old files deleted. Typically, several authors work
on several computers on the same and/or different files and keeping
track of every change can become a tedious task. In the open source
community, the general solution to this problem is to use version
control, typically provided by the majority of SCM tools. For this
reason R-Forge utilizes SVN to facilitate the developer's work when
creating software.

A central repository ensures that the developer always has access to the
current version of the project's source code. Any of the authorized
collaborators can "check out" (i.e., download) or "update" the project
file structure, make the necessary changes or additions, delete files
from the current revision and finally "commit" changes or additions to
the repository. More than that, SVN keeps track of the complete history
of the project file structure. At any point in the development stage it
is possible to go back to any previous stage in the history to inspect
and restore old files. This is called version control, as every stage
automatically is assigned a unique version number which increases over
time.

On R-Forge such a version-controlled repository is automatically created
for each project. To get started, the project members just have to
install the client of their choice (e.g., Tortoise SVN on Windows or
svnX on Mac OS X) and check out the repository. In addition to the
inherent backup of every version within the repository a backup of the
whole repository is generated daily.

A rights management system assures that, by default, anonymous users
have read access and developers have write access to the data associated
with a certain project on R-Forge. More precisely, registered users can
be granted one of several roles: e.g., the "Administrator" has all
rights including the right to add new users to the project or release
packages directly to CRAN. He/she is usually the package maintainer, the
project leader or has registered the project originally. Other members
of a project typically have either the role "Senior Developer" or
"Junior Developer" which both have permission to commit to the project
SVN repository and examine the log files in the *R Packages* tab (the
differences between the two roles are subtle, e.g., senior developers
additionally have administrative privileges in several places in the
project). When we speak of developers in subsequent sections we refer to
project members having the rights at least of a junior developer.

## Release and quality management {#sec:release_and_quality_management}

Development versions of a software project are typically prototypes and
are subject to many changes. Thus, R-Forge offers two tools which assist
the developers in improving the quality of their source code.

First, it offers a quality management system similar to that of CRAN.
Packages on R-Forge are checked in a standardized way on different
platforms based on `R CMD check` at least once daily. The resulting log
files can be examined by the project developers so that they can improve
the package to pass all tests on R-Forge and subsequently on CRAN.

Second, bug tracking systems allow users to notify package authors about
problems they encounter. In the spirit of OSS---given enough eyeballs,
all bugs are shallow [@forge:Raymond:1999]---peer code review leads to
an overall improvement of the quality of software projects.

## Additional features

A number of further tools, of increased interest for larger projects,
help developers to coordinate their work and to communicate with their
user base. These tools include:

-   Project websites: Developers may present their work on a subdomain
    of R-Forge, e.g., <http://foo.R-Forge.R-project.org/>, or via a link
    to an external website.

-   Mailing lists: By default a list `foo-commits@`\
    `lists.R-Forge.R-project.org` is automatically created for each
    project. Additional mailing lists can be set up easily.

-   Project categorization: Administrators may categorize their project
    in several so-called "Trove Categories" in the *Admin* tab of their
    project (under *Trove Categorization*). For each category three
    different items can be selected. This enables users to quickly find
    what they are looking for using the *Project Tree* tab.

-   News: Announcements and other information related to a project can
    be put on the project summary page as well as on the home page of
    R-Forge. The latter needs approval by one of the R-Forge
    administrators. All items are available as RSS feeds.

-   Forums: Discussion forums can be set up separately by the project
    administrators.

# How to get started

This section is intended to be a hands-on tutorial for new users.
Depending on familiarity with the systems/tools involved the
instructions might be somewhat brief. In case of problems we recommend
consulting the user's manual [@forge:usermanual:2008] which contains
detailed step-by-step instructions.

![Figure 1: Home page of R-Forge on
2009-03-10](rforge_main_snapshot_modified.png){#fig:home_page
width="100%" alt="graphic without alt text"}

When accessing the URL <http://R-Forge.R-project.org/> the home page is
presented (see Figure [1](#fig:home_page)). Here one can

-   login,

-   register a user or a project,

-   download the documentation,

-   examine the latest news and changes,

-   go to a specific project website either by searching for available
    projects (top middle of the page), by clicking on one of the
    projects listed on the right, or by going through the listing in the
    *Project Tree* tab.

Registered users can access their personal page via the tab named *My
Page*. Figure [2](#fig:my_page) shows the personal page of the first
author.

![Figure 2: The My Page tab of the first
author](rforge_my_page_snapshot.png){#fig:my_page width="100%" alt="graphic without alt text"}

## Registering as a new user

To use R-Forge as a developer, one has to register as a site user. A
link on the main web site called *New Account* on the top right of the
home page leads to the corresponding registration form.

After submitting the completed form, an e-mail is sent to the given
address containing a link for activating the account. Subsequently, all
R-Forge features, including joining existing or creating new projects,
are available to logged-in users.

## Registering a project

There are two possibilities to register a project: Clicking on *Register
Your Project* on the home page or going to the *My Page* tab and
clicking on *Register Project* (see Figure [2](#fig:my_page) below the
main tabs). Both links lead to a form which has to be filled out in
order to finish the registration process. In the text field "Project
Public Description" the registrant is supposed to enter a concise
description of the project. This text and the "Project Full Name" will
be shown in several places on R-Forge (see e.g.,
Figure [1](#fig:home_page)). The text entered in the field "Project
Purpose And Summarization" is additional information for the R-Forge
administrators, inspected for approval. "Project Unix Name" refers to
the name which uniquely determines the project. In the case of a project
that contains a single R package, the project Unix name typically
corresponds to the package name (in its lower-case version).
Restrictions according to the Unix file system convention force Unix
names to be in lower case (and will be converted automatically if they
are typed in upper case).

After the completed form is submitted, the project has to be approved by
the R-Forge administrators and a confirmation e-mail is sent to the
registrant upon approval. After that, the registrant automatically
becomes the project administrator and the standardized web area of the
project (`http://R-Forge.R-project.org/projects/foo/`) is immediately
available on R-Forge. This web area includes a *Summary* page, an
*Admin* tab visible only to the project administrators, and various
other tabs depending on the features enabled for this project in the
*Admin* tab. To present the new project to a broader community the name
of the project additionally is promoted on the home page under "Recently
Registered Projects" (see Figure [1](#fig:home_page)).

Furthermore, within an hour after approval a default mailing list and
the project's SVN repository containing a file and two pre-defined
directories called and are created. The content of these directories is
used by the R-Forge server for creating R packages and a project
website, respectively.

## SCM and R packages

The first step after creation of a project is typically to start
generation of content for one (or more) R package(s) in the directory.
Developers can either start committing changes via SVN as usual or---if
the package is already version-controlled somewhere else---the
corresponding parts of the repository including the history can be
migrated to R-Forge (see Section 6 of the user's manual).

The *SCM* tab of a project explains how the corresponding SVN repository
located at `svn://svn.R-Forge.R-project.org/svnroot/foo` can be checked
out. From this URL the sources are checked out either anonymously
without write permission (enabled by default) or as developer using an
encrypted authentication method, namely secure shell (`ssh`). Via this
secure protocol (`svn+ssh://` followed by the registered user name)
developers have full access to the repository. Typically, the developer
is authenticated via the registered password but it is also possible to
upload a secure shell key (updated hourly) to make use of public/private
key authentication. Section 3.2 of the user's manual explains this
process in more detail.

To make use of the package builds and checks the package source code has
to be put into the directory of the repository (i.e., , , , etc.) or,
alternatively, a subdirectory of . The latter structure allows
developers to have more than one package in a single project; e.g., if a
project consists of the packages `foo` and `bar`, then the source code
is located in and , respectively.

R-Forge automatically examines the directory of every repository and
builds the package sources as well as the package binaries on a daily
basis for Mac OS X and Windows (if applicable). The package builds are
provided in the *R Packages* tab (see Figure [3](#fig:rpackages_tab))
for download or can be installed directly in R using
`install.packages("foo", repos="http://R-Forge.R-project.org")`.
Furthermore, in the *R Packages* tab developers can examine logs of the
build and check process on different platforms.

To release a package to CRAN the project administrator clicks on *Submit
this package to CRAN* in the *R Packages* tab. Upon confirmation, a
message will be sent to and the latest successfully built source package
(the file) is automatically copied to
<ftp://CRAN.R-project.org/incoming/>. Note that packages are built once
daily, i.e., the latest source package does not include more recent code
committed to the SVN repository.

Figure [3](#fig:rpackages_tab) shows the *R Packages* tab of the *tm*
project (<http://R-Forge.R-project.org/projects/tm/>) as one of the
project administrators would see it. Depending on whether you are a
member of the project or not and your rights you will see only parts of
the information provided for each package.

![Figure 3: R Packages tab of the tm
project](rforge_tm_packages_developer_snapshot.png){#fig:rpackages_tab
width="100%" alt="graphic without alt text"}

## Further steps

A customized project website, accessible through
<http://foo.R-Forge.R-project.org/> where `foo` corresponds to the unix
name of the project, is managed via the directory. The website gets
updated every hour.

The changes made to the project can be examined by entering the
corresponding standardized web area. On entry, the *Summary* page is
shown. Here, one can

-   examine the details of the project including a short description and
    a listing of the administrators and developers,

-   follow a link leading to the project homepage,

-   examine the latest news announcements (if available),

-   go to other sections of the project like *Forums*, *Tracker*,
    *Lists*, *R Packages*, etc.

-   follow the download link leading directly to the available packages
    of the project (i.e., the *R Packages* tab).

Furthermore, meta-information about a project can be supplied in the
*Admin* tab via so-called "Trove Categorization".

# Recent and future developments {#recent-and-future-developments .unnumbered}

In this section, we briefly summarize the major changes and updates to
the R-Forge system during the last few months and give an outlook to
future developments.

Recently added features and major changes include:

-   New defaults for freshly registered projects: Only the tabs *Lists*,
    *SCM* and *R packages* are enabled initially. *Forums*, *Tracker*
    and *News* can be activated separately (in order not to overwhelm
    new users with too many features) using *Edit Public Info* in the
    *Admin* tab of the project. Experienced users can decide which
    features they want and activate them.

-   An enhanced structure in the SVN repository allowing multiple
    packages in a single project (see above).

-   The R package *RForgeTools* [@forge:theussl:2008] contains
    platform-independent package building and quality management code
    used on the R-Forge servers.

-   A modified *News* submit page offering two types of submissions:
    project-specific and global news. The latter needs approval by one
    of the R-Forge administrators (default: project-only submission).

-   Circulation of SVN commit messages can be enabled in the *SCM Admin*
    tab by project administrators. The mailing list mentioned in the
    text field is used for delivering the SVN commit messages (default:
    off).

-   Mailing list search facilities provided by the Swish-e engine which
    can be accessed via the *List* tab (private lists are not included
    in the search index).

Further features and improvements which are currently on the wishlist or
under development include

-   a Wiki,

-   task management facilities,

-   a re-organized tracker more compatible with R package development
    and,

-   an update of the underlying GForge system to its successor
    FusionForge (<http://FusionForge.org/>).
