title: 'spherepc: An R Package for Dimension Reduction on a Sphere'
abstract: ' Dimension reduction is a technique that can compress given data and reduce
  noise. Recently, a dimension reduction technique on spheres, called spherical principal
  curves (SPC), has been proposed. SPC fits a curve that passes through the middle
  of data with a stationary property on spheres. In addition, a study of local principal
  geodesics (LPG) is considered to identify the complex structure of data. Through
  the description and implementation of various examples, this paper introduces an
  R package [spherepc](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=spherepc) for dimension
  reduction of data lying on a sphere, including existing methods, SPC and LPG. '
