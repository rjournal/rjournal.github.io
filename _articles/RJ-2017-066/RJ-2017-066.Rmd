title: glmmTMB Balances Speed and Flexibility Among Packages for Zero-inflated Generalized
  Linear Mixed Modeling
abstract: Count data can be analyzed using generalized linear mixed models when observations
  are correlated in ways that require random effects. However, count data are often
  zero-inflated, containing more zeros than would be expected from the typical error
  distributions. We present a new package, glmmTMB, and compare it to other R packages
  that fit zero-inflated mixed models. The glmmTMB package fits many types of GLMMs
  and extensions, including models with continuously distributed responses, but here
  we focus on count responses. glmmTMB is faster than glmmADMB, MCMCglmm, and brms,
  and more flexible than INLA and mgcv for zero-inflated modeling. One unique feature
  of glmmTMB (among packages that fit zero-inflated mixed models) is its ability to
  estimate the Conway-Maxwell-Poisson distribution parameterized by the mean. Overall,
  its most appealing features for new users may be the combination of speed, flexibility,
  and its interface’s similarity to lme4.
