title: 'CompModels: A Suite of Computer Model Test Functions for Bayesian Optimization'
abstract: The CompModels package for R provides a suite of computer model test functions
  that can be used for computer model prediction/emulation, uncertainty quantification,
  and calibration. Moreover, the CompModels package is especially well suited for
  the sequential optimization of computer models. The package is a mix of real-world
  physics problems, known mathematical functions, and black-box functions that have
  been converted into computer models with the goal of Bayesian (i.e., sequential)
  optimization in mind. Likewise, the package contains computer models that represent
  either the constrained or unconstrained optimization case, each with varying levels
  of difficulty. In this paper, we illustrate the use of the package with both real-world
  examples and black-box functions by solving constrained optimization problems via
  Bayesian optimization. Ultimately, the package is shown to provide users with a
  source of computer model test functions that are reproducible, shareable, and that
  can be used for benchmarking of novel optimization methods.
