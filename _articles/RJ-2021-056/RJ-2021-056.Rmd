title: A Method for Deriving Information from Running R Code
abstract: It is often useful to tap information from a running R script. Obvious use
  cases include monitoring the consumption of resources (time, memory) and logging.
  Perhaps less obvious cases include tracking changes in R objects or collecting the
  output of unit tests. In this paper, we demonstrate an approach that abstracts the
  collection and processing of such secondary information from the running R script.
  Our approach is based on a combination of three elements. The first element is to
  build a customized way to evaluate code. The second is labeled *local masking* and
  it involves temporarily masking a user-facing function so an alternative version
  of it is called. The third element we label *local side effect*. This refers to
  the fact that the masking function exports information to the secondary information
  flow without altering a global state. The result is a method for building systems
  in pure R that lets users create and control secondary flows of information with
  minimal impact on their workflow and no global side effects.
