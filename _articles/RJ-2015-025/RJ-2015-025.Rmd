title: 'BSGS: Bayesian Sparse Group Selection'
abstract: An R package BSGS is provided for the integration of Bayesian variable and
  sparse group selection separately proposed by Chen et al. (2011) and Chen et al.
  (in press) for variable selection problems, even in the cases of large p and small
  n. This package is designed for variable selection problems including the identification
  of the important groups of variables and the active variables within the important
  groups. This article introduces the functions in the BSGS package that can be used
  to perform sparse group selection as well as variable selection through simulation
  studies and real data.
