title: 'sgr: A Package for Simulating Conditional Fake Ordinal Data'
abstract: Many self-report measures of attitudes, beliefs, personality, and pathology
  include items that can be easily manipulated by respondents. For example, an individual
  may deliberately attempt to manipulate or distort responses to simulate grossly
  exaggerated physical or psychological symptoms in order to reach specific goals
  such as, for example, obtaining financial compensation, avoiding being charged with
  a crime, avoiding military duty, or obtaining drugs. This article introduces the
  package sgr that can be used to perform fake data analysis according to the sample
  generation by replacement approach. The package includes functions for making simple
  inferences about discrete/ordinal fake data. The package allows to quantify uncertainty
  in inferences based on possible fake data as well as to study the implications of
  fake data for empirical results.
