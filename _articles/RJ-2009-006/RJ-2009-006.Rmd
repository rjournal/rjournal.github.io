title: Drawing Diagrams with R
abstract: R provides a number of well-known high-level facilities for producing sophisticated
  statistical plots, including the “traditional” plots in the graphics package (R
  Development Core Team, 2008), the Trellis-style plots provided by lattice (Sarkar,
  2008), and the grammar-of-graphics-inspired approach of ggplot2 (Wickham, 2009).
