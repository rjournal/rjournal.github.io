title: A Software Tool For Sparse Estimation Of A General Class Of High-dimensional
  GLMs
abstract: ' Generalized linear models are the workhorse of many inferential problems.
  Also in the modern era with high-dimensional settings, such models have been proven
  to be effective exploratory tools. Most attention has been paid to Gaussian, binomial
  and Poisson settings, which have efficient computational implementations and where
  either the dispersion parameter is largely irrelevant or absent. However, general
  GLMs have dispersion parameters $\phi$ that affect the value of the log-likelihood.
  This in turn, affects the value of various information criteria such as AIC and
  BIC, and has a considerable impact on the computation and selection of the optimal
  model. The R-package [dglars](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=dglars) is one
  of the standard packages to perform high-dimensional analyses for GLMs. Being based
  on fundamental likelihood considerations, rather than arbitrary penalization, it
  naturally extends to the general GLM setting. In this paper, we present an improved
  predictor-corrector (IPC) algorithm for computing the differential geometric least
  angle regression (dgLARS) solution curve, proposed in [@Augug13] and [@pazira].
  We describe the implementation of a stable estimator of the dispersion parameter
  proposed in [@pazira] for high-dimensional exponential dispersion models. A simulation
  study is conducted to test the performance of the proposed methods and algorithms.
  We illustrate the methods using an example. The described improvements have been
  implemented in a new version of the R-package [dglars](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=dglars). '
