title: Performance Attribution for Equity Portfolios
abstract: 'The pa package provides tools for conducting performance attribution for
  long-only, single currency equity portfolios. The package uses two methods: the
  Brinson-Hood-Beebower model (hereafter referred to as the Brinson model) and a regression-based
  analysis. The Brinson model takes an ANOVA-type approach and decomposes the active
  return of any portfolio into asset allocation, stock selection, and interaction
  effect. The regression-based analysis utilizes estimated coefficients, based on
  a regression model, to attribute active return to different factors.'
