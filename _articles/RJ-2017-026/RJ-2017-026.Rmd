title: 'Hosting Data Packages via drat: A Case Study with Hurricane Exposure Data'
abstract: Data-only packages offer a way to provide extended functionality for other
  R users. However, such packages can be large enough to exceed the package size limit
  (5 megabytes) for the Comprehen sive R Archive Network (CRAN). As an alternative,
  large data packages can be posted to additional repostiories beyond CRAN itself
  in a way that allows smaller code packages on CRAN to access and use the data. The
  drat package facilitates creation and use of such alternative repositories and makes
  it particularly simple to host them via GitHub. CRAN packages can draw on packages
  posted to drat repositories through the use of the ‘Additonal_repositories’ field
  in the DESCRIPTION file. This paper describes how R users can create a suite of
  coordinated packages, in which larger data packages are hosted in an alternative
  repository created with drat, while a smaller code package that interacts with this
  data is created that can be submitted to CRAN.
