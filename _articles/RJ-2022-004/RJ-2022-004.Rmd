title: Measuring the Extent and Patterns of Urban Shrinkage for Small Towns Using
  R
abstract: 'Urban shrinking is a phenomenon as common as urban expansion nowadays and
  it affects urban settlements of all sizes, especially from developed and industrialized
  countries in Europe, America and Asia. The paper aims to assess the patterns of
  shrinkage for small and medium sized towns in Oltenia region (Romania), considering
  demographic, economic and social indicators with a methodological approach which
  considers the use of different functions and applications of R packages. Thirteen
  selected indicators are analysed to perform the multivariate analysis on Principal
  Component Analysis using the `prcomp()` function and the [*ggplot2*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=ggplot2)
  package to visualize the patterns of urban shrinkage. Two composite indicators were
  additionally created to measure the extent of urban shrinkage: CSI (Composite Shrinking
  Index) and RDC (Regional Demographic Change) for two-time intervals. Based on the
  CSI, three major categories of shrinking were observed: persistent shrinkage, mild
  shrinking or slow evolution toward shrinking, where the vast majority of towns are
  found (including mining towns, where there still is a delayed restructuring of state-owned
  enterprises, and towns characterised by the agrarization of local economies), and
  stagnant/stabilized shrinkage.'

# Introduction

Shrinking cities, considered up until recently a politically taboo
subject in Europe, systematically disregarded as a dominant development
trend of some urban areas [@wiechmann_what_2007; @nelle_urban_2017], and
a stigmatized topic in planning research [@pallagst_viewpoint_2010], are
ever more present among the research topic of various scholars
throughout the world, as well as the agenda of public authorities and
policy makers. Thus, the concept of shrinking cities differs from the
classic notion of urban decline since new processes are at stake
[@cunningham-sabot_theoretical_2014].

From a historical perspective, the current period of shrinkage is
distinguishable from the earlier period of decline and an earlier period
of growth as well, mainly due to the prevalence of population loss, less
so in its severity and not in its persistence or lack thereof
[@beauregard_shrinking_2013]. Today, the concept of shrinking cities
connotes the urban degenerative effects of the breakdown of Fordist
agglomeration economies, as well as the effects of urban agglomerative
and dissipative forces associated with the global diffusion of
contemporary, post-Fordist systems of production
[@audirac_shrinking_2014].

Beginning with the 20th century, shrinking cities have developed
continuously into a global phenomenon, being located mainly in Central
Europe, the US, Japan and Eastern European transformation countries
[@oswalt_atlas_2006]. They tend to have a common industrial past and are
now faced with large challenges as a result of economic restructuring
[@urban_audit_state_2007]. In Europe, the number of growing cities has
been falling steadily since the 1960s, while almost a quarter (24%) of
the cities have registered a medium-term decline (almost half of all the
Russian, Polish and Romanian cities with a population over 200,000
inhabitants) and more than a third showed a clear downturn since 1990
[@turok_trajectories_2007]. Still, the phenomenon is not equally spread
throughout Europe, some countries and regions being more affected, i.e.
post socialist countries, where almost half of cities can be described
as shrinking [@wiechmann_urban_2013], while others, such as France,
experiencing a more-limited intensity in terms of number of cities
affected and population loss [@wolff_shrinking_2013].

Since the publication of *Die Schrympfende Stadt (the Shrinking City)*
[@gob_schrumpfende_1977] and *Coping with City Shrinkage*
[@breckenfeld_coping_1978], some of the ways of understanding the city
have changed in emphasis. Researchers' efforts have focused on capturing
the main features of the phenomenon due to its role in the
reconfiguration of the urban space, which resulted in a substantial
literature on urban shrinking that is undoubtedly an incontrovertible
and increasingly important phenomenon, and a major challenge for future
urban policies
[@agirre-maskariano_politiques_2019; @bernt_policy_2012; @mallach_shrinking_2017; @nelle_urban_2017; @pallagst_viewpoint_2010; @wiechmann_responding_2015; @wiechmann_urban_2013].

The last two decades saw an emergence of a corpus of research and
projects designed to assess general causes and models of shrinkage.
Several authors identify four to five major drivers for shrinkage, which
are often found in a combination of two or more of these causes: i)
suburbanization (flight of people and jobs to the suburbs, hollowing out
of the core city, triggered by urban
sprawl)[@wiechmann_types_2006; @wiechmann_responding_2015; @cunningham-sabot_theoretical_2014; @audirac_shrinking_2014; @reckien_why_2011; @wiechmann_responding_2015],
ii) economic decline and industrial transformation
[@wiechmann_types_2006; @rink_addressing_2010; @haase_conceptualizing_2014],
iii) demographic change (e.g. falling birth rates, outmigration in rural
depopulation areas)
[@rink_addressing_2010; @haase_conceptualizing_2014; @wiechmann_responding_2015];
iv) structural upheaval (economic reorganization, collapse of an entire
political system, unrest, resettlements) and environmental pollution
[@wiechmann_types_2006; @haase_conceptualizing_2014; @cunningham-sabot_theoretical_2014; @wiechmann_responding_2015].

Over the past decades, shrinkage has become a \"normal pathway\" of
development for cities and regions all across Europe
[@rink_addressing_2010]. Recent writing and research on the shrinking
cities have also focused on indicators of urban shrinkage, which should
be necessarily dynamic and capable of detecting medium-term tendencies,
distinguishing between episodic or acute shrinkage (when developments
fluctuate in a certain period, but have an overall negative evaluation)
and continuous or chronic shrinking [@wolff_indicators_2014]. Since
population loss, which is an initial clue of urban processes and a major
indicator for urban shrinkage, does not encompass the various aspects of
the phenomenon, there is a continuous focus on indicators to measure
shrinking cities. They can be summarized into three main categories:
demographic indicators, economic indicators and social indicators.

Among the demographic indicators, migration, population natural increase
and a shifting population structure (ageing and feminization) are key
factors of population decline, highly connected to other social,
economic and built environment variables
[@turok_trajectories_2007; @guimaraes_shrinking_2015; @haase_varieties_2016; @banica_challenges_2017; @cauchi-duval_decroissance_2017; @hartt_how_2018].
Indicators related to economic changes (employment, unemployment, firms,
services) are more difficult to gather and raise issues in terms of
comparability among countries [@martinez-fernandez_shrinking_2015], but
should not be neglected as the economic decline is among the drivers of
shrinkage. Social indicators usually considered when analysing shrinkage
refer either to households (housing permit rates, housing start rate,
number of households)
[@bontje_facing_2004; @wolff_indicators_2014; @guimaraes_shrinking_2015; @lauf_effects_2016; @hartt_how_2018],
or to the number of students enrolled in education units
[@guimaraes_shrinking_2015]. This decreases attractiveness of a city as
an educational place. Consequently, it causes a decreasing number of
students enrolled in compulsory education levels and the closure of
educational institutions [@wolff_indicators_2014].

Most of the studies regarding shrinking cities focus on larger urban
centres, exceeding two hundred thousand inhabitants. However, many of
the spatial planning and development strategies of the European Union
focus on small and medium-sized towns, often seen as the chronic
patients of regional policy, constantly in need of care but never
getting well [@wirth_peripheralisation_2016]. Most of the French
shrinking cities are small urban areas, with less than 50,000
inhabitants, while in Germany the most dramatic decrease occurs in
medium sized cities [@martinez-fernandez_shrinking_2015]. In Hungary,
almost every small town has shrunk during at least the last decade
[@pirisi_between_2015]. In Romania, the discussion within urban planning
has also begun, despite focusing on some larger towns, researchers from
various fields drawing attention to this issue
[@banica_challenges_2017; @jucu_economic_2016; @jucu_post-communist_2019; @paun_constantinescu_shrinking_2019; @popescu_deindustrialization_2014; @schoenberg_urban_2014; @stoica_exploring_2020; @steinfuhrer_small_2020]
since the Romanian towns clearly witness a decline on short or medium
term, which is uneven, but in perpetuum
[@paun_constantinescu_shrinking_2013].

# Data and methods

The multidimensional concept of shrinking cities has a comprehensive
meaning, as the drivers which determine this process are complex
(demographic, economic, social). Therefore official statistics from the
last three censuses (1992, 2002, 2011) and from 2018 were used to
calculate indicators. We applied simple standard formulae in population
geography regarding the demographic and economic phenomena such as
population natural increase, feminization, migration, ageing,
unemployment, i.e. *k*~1~-*k*~6~ and construct composite indices. All
indices used in the analysis of this phenomenon were based on their
importance and relationship to each other and to the concept itself.
After a thorough documentation focusing on other studies referring to
shrinking cities
[@haase_varieties_2016; @hartt_how_2018; @mallach_shrinking_2017; @rink_addressing_2010; @wiechmann_responding_2015; @wiechmann_urban_2013]
we selected a series of demographic and socio-economic indicators that
met the criteria of availability and relevance for the study.
Availability and consistency of data for small Romanian towns
represented a major issue, as there are missing time series and uneven
statistics. Thus, in order to perform the calculation without errors
caused by missing values, authors imputed these missing values with
zero, as the frequency of missingness was not high and it was observed
that zero imputing does not affect the results of the study. This major
issue played an important role in the selection of the best indicators
considered for the multivariate analysis and the aggregation method. The
chosen indicators vary in terms of measurement unit, as they are
expressed as absolute or computed data (Table [1](#table:1)), but we
also weighted their strengths and weaknesses.

The work flow consists in several stages, the main step concentrating on
the creation and use of the composite indicators (CSI and RDC) (Figure
[1](#figure:workflow)).

![Figure 1: Overall workflow for the research methodology, depicting the
main steps of the process, from the selection of indicators to the

width="100%" alt="graphic without alt text"}

As defined by @oecd_handbook_2008 in the Glossary of Statistical terms
*\"a composite indicator is obtained from the combination of individual
indicators into a single index, on the basis of an underlying model of
the multidimensional concept that is being measured\"*.

The study uses two types of composite indices to observe and analyse the
dynamics of the shrinking process specific for the cities in the South
West Development Region of Oltenia. The first composite indicator used
is the Regional Demographic Change (RDC) obtained by applying the
methodology described by @tivig_mapping_2008 in the *Final Report of the
Mapping Regional Demographic Change and Regional Demographic Location
Risk in Europe*. The RDC index was initially used to describe the
process of ageing and shrinking of the population in 27 European states
from 264 regions. We adapted the methodology to compute this index for
34 towns located in the South West Development Region of Oltenia. The
RDC index captures the extent and time-path of demographic change by
accounting for two of its dimensions: population ageing with the
perspective of shrinking. The RDC index is calculated using raw
indicators for age, like the mean age, and population size like
population density. Based on these two indicators for population age and
density, the ageing and shrinking process are calculated and assessed in
absolute terms for each town and three periods of time (please see
research data, sheet *mean_age* and *density* for calculated data).
Thus, the index was calculated for 3 time-intervals: 1992-2018;
2018-2030 and 1992-2030. In order to be able to make cross-period
comparison, a rescaling was necessary. For analyzing the relative
position of the towns within the region in terms of ageing and shrinking
the values computed previously had been z-standardized
[@tivig_mapping_2008]. If the RDC index shows the demographic change
that takes place in the small towns under analysis, the RDC type
indicate whether their population ages faster or slower and grows less
or shrinks as compared to the average of the region. The four types of
the RDC-index were applied to one regional dimension (South West
Development Region of Oltenia) and represented showing the overall trend
(1992-2030) and the future trend (2018-2030).

The second composite indicator (CSI) was created based on thirteen
sub-indices (*k*~1~...~13~) computed for all 34 towns located in the
study area and aggregated into a single index using the additive method
[@gan_when_2017; @nardo_tools_2005; @oecd_handbook_2008; @saisana_state_2002; @syrovatka_measuring_2019].
The additive aggregation method, and especially the weighted arithmetic
mean, is the widest used method
[@gan_when_2017; @pollesch_applications_2015] as it sums up the
normalized values of sub-indicators. The Principal Component Analysis
(PCA) was performed to analyse the correlation between the
sub-indicators. We intended to use similar indicators as in other
studies (Table [1](#table:1)), but approach a different method and
process data in R. The multiple packages make this language a powerful
tool for data processing and visualization [@barry_collections_2018]
with multiple possibilities of application, especially in spatial
analysis [@lovelace_geocomputation_2019]. As the sub-indicators had
different measurement scales, variable standardization was handled using
the option `scale=true` in `prcomp()`. Complying with the minimum
required rule of 3:1 [@jollands_usefulness_2003], the use of this method
allows summarizing the entire set of individual indicators
[@paul_methodological_2013; @jolliffe_principal_2016], while preserving
the maximum possible proportion of the total variation in the original
data set [@sharma_applied_1996]. The PCA results were represented using
the *ggplot2* package [@kassambara_r_2017; @wickham_ggplot2_2016].

# Results

PCA was used to analyse the interrelationships among all thirteen
variables (Table [1](#table:1)) observed in 34 small towns located in
Oltenia region, in two reference years 1992 and 2018. The main
characteristic of this method is the reduction of a great number of
variables to a smaller number (principal components), as linear
combinations of the variables in the multivariate set, with minimum loss
of information. Principal components outputs where computed using
`prcomp()` for an improved numerical accuracy and displayed using
`screeplot()`.

![Figure 2: Scree plot of the principal components. The graphic
representation of variances allows for easier selection of relevant
components.](screeplot.png){#figure:screeplot width="100%"
alt="graphic without alt text"}

Analysing the scree plots, there are small differences in the
eigenvalues of the components comparing the two years observed (Figure
[2](#figure:screeplot)). If we use the Kaiser criterion, we see that
only the first four (1992), respectively three (2018) components have
eigenvalues greater than 1. But these components explain only 79.5% of
the variation in the data for 1992 and 73.2% for 2018 and usually a
cumulative proportion of at least 85%, that explain an acceptable level
of variance, is obtained by the first five principal components. The
fourth and fifth eigenvalues of the principal components in 2018 are
only close to the value of 1. Therefore, values which are greater than
0.75 are considered as \"strong\". For an acceptable level of variance,
we selected the first five principal components for analysis (Table
[2](#table:2)).

  : Table 4: The first five values of the principal components for the
  variables $k_{1}$-$k_{13}$ in 1992 and 2018.
:::

For this set of results, the first principal component is strongly
correlated with almost all the original variables of the social and
economic factors in 1992 and 2018. It has exclusively negative
correlations with almost all (except unemployment rate) variables
observed in 2018. So, this component measures primarily the
social-economic factors that influence the shrinking process of small
cities. The second component measures the demographic dimension of
shirking, as it has negative correlations for the rate of natural
increase and positive correlations for the rest of the demographic
variables like the feminization index, the percent of elders and the
mean age. This fact suggests that the five criteria in 1992 and six in
2018 vary together, increasing or decreasing. The third and fourth
components indicate correlations with both economic and demographic
variables. The third component has negative correlations in 1992 and
positive in 2018 for the migration rate and unemployment rate. In 2018,
the third component is also strongly correlated with the number of
employees. The fourth component shows a shift in correlations, as they
are positive in 1992 with the introduction of a variable from the social
sector (number of schools) and negative in 2018 for the demographic
variables, but positive for the unemployment rate. The fifth component
indicates also several changes in 2018 as compared to 1992, because in
2018 it has correlations only for the social variables (positive for the
number of doctors and hospital beds and negative correlations for the
number of libraries and schools) (Table [4](#table:4)).

The scope of this analysis is to identify the directions (principal
components) along which the variation in the data is the highest. As the
first two components account for most of the variance in the date, to
achieve this goal, the dimensionality of the multivariate data was
reduced into two principal components, in order to be able to visualize
them graphically. The two graphs were generated in R using the
*ggplot2*, [*ggrepel*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=ggrepel),
[*gridExtra*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=gridExtra) and
[*readxl*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=readxl) packages (see
`shrinking_cities.r` from supplemental material).

The graphic visualization of the results allows to analyse the variance
of the variables and the change in direction trends for 1992 and 2018.
Analysing the scores of the second principal component versus the scores
of the first principal component, we notice that, in 1992, the first
principal component has large positive associations with the number of
houses, libraries, doctors, pupils, schools and hospital beds and
negative associations with the number of employees. So, it measures
mainly the social dimension of the cities as shrinkage factors. The
second component measures primarily the demographic dimension as it has
large positive loadings on the rate of elders and mean age (Figure
[3](#figure:pca), 1992). This aspect is changing entirely in 2018, if we
observe the directions along which we have the highest variance of the
date. Thus, the demographic variables (migration rate and elders)
strongly influence component 1, while the social-economic variables
influence the second component. For a better view of differences amongst
towns, the points representing the urban settlements, vary in size and
intensity according to the values of the third and fourth components
(Figure [3](#figure:pca), 2018).

The changes in population, especially the processes of ageing and
shrinking, have a direct influence on the socio-economic dimension of
settlements. As in most European countries, the ageing of the population
is a phenomenon that characterizes almost all the settlements in Romania
and will continue, but with different intensities; however, ageing
greatly varies among the towns considered for analysis. The dimension of
shrinking is given by the decrease in the number of inhabitants, which
is better expressed by the decrease in the population density. The data
indicated that, same as the ageing process, depopulation is another
characteristic of the selected towns.

We used the RDC index to compare, at regional level, the dimension of
ageing and shrinking of all 34 small towns located in Oltenia. Three
time-intervals were considered (1992-2018 - past; 2018-2030 - future and
1992-2030 - overall) to show the overall and the future trend (Figure
[4](#figure:rdc)).

![Figure 4: Future (2018-2030, left) and Overall (1992-2030, right)
trends of Regional Demographic Change (RDC-type) for small towns in
South-West Development Region of Oltenia](rdc.png){#figure:rdc
width="100%" alt="graphic without alt text"}

After examining the population trend for every town, we identified four
categories, differentiated by ageing, population evolution and
shrinking. This shows that some towns are more resilient to shrinkage
than others, due to a combination of factors. However, there is clear
evidence that a significant number of towns (about 40%) are shrinking,
while 80% face a fast-ageing process of the population.

The results indicated that there are some demographic changes between
the future trend and the overall trend. If the share of towns included
in the first two categories remains unchanged during the two analysed
periods, their number shows a slight change for the fourth and third
types. These results indicate that some settlements will pass in the
future from higher growth and slower ageing (type III) to higher growth
and faster ageing (IV) (Figure [4](#figure:rdc) & Table [5](#table:5)).

Using the composite indicator (CSI) we computed the values for the
beginning and present period and analysed the dimension of change for
all 34 towns at demographic and social-economic levels for the future
period (2030). The indicator includes all thirteen sub-indices (Table
[1](#table:1)) considered important in the shrinking process of cities.
The values of CSI for 1992 and 2018 were calculated using the following
formula:

$$\label{formula}
	CSI = \sum_{i=1}^{n}\frac{k_{i}-min\left(k_{i}\right)}{n\left(max\left(k_{i}\right)-min\left(k_{i}\right)\right)}   (\#eq:formula)$$

where:\

  --------------------------------------- -------------------------------
  $n$:                                    subindicator count

  $k_{i}$:                   selected subindicator

  $min\left(k_{i}\right)$:   minimum value of subindicator

  $max\left(k_{i}\right)$:   maximum value of subindicator
  --------------------------------------- -------------------------------

  : 

To observe the shrinking trend of small towns for future period, the
values for year 2030 were calculated based on the computed values of CSI
for 1992, 2002, 2011 and 2018 using the forecast function in Microsoft
Office Excel to predict the values for 2030. Standard deviation
(St.dev.) values were calculated to observe highest values. The results
were compared and represented, observing that thirteen towns have high
variations and St.dev. values \> 0.04 (Table [6](#table:6) & Figure
[5](#figure:scatterplot)).

# Discussions

As we initially calculated the RDC index for all 34 towns to analyse the
dimension of shrinking, we deem necessary to use a more complex index to
include economic and social dimensions. @tivig_mapping_2008 analyses the
dimension of shrinking using only demographic indices, classifying
cities in four categories. However, the scientific literature considers
the topic of shrinking cities as a more complex process, which involves
social and economic factors
[@bernt_policy_2012; @martinez-fernandez_shrinking_2015; @wolff_indicators_2014].

Besides the general factors, local features also contribute to the
shrinking process of cities, especially for smaller ones. Therefore, we
deem necessary to also use another, more complex, composite indicator.
After comparing the results, we concluded that only six towns undergo a
clear shrinking process, falling into the category of persistent
shrinkage, while eighteen have a moderate or slow evolution toward
shrinking (recent or mild shrinkage). There are also ten settlements
that had a linear, almost stagnant, evolution for the entire reference
period with the same future trend (Figure [6](#figure:shrinking)).

According to CSI values the towns can be classified in three categories:
persistent shrinkage, a mild evolution towards shrinkage and stagnant
shrinkage. The first category includes only 6 towns, which is less than
a fifth of the analysed towns, and except for OrÈova, they did not
benefit during the communist period from any state-owned flagship
companies and did not have any significant industrial base. This
category varies largely in terms of population size, population loss,
economic activities and rural/urban characteristics. The smaller and
more rural in character the town, the greater the pressure on shrinkage
is. Just as in other regions, the regional and local economic
restructuring alter the urban communities [@jucu_economic_2016].

A mild/slow evolution toward shrinkage characterizes the towns of
BÄileÈti, Bechet, Calafat, Tismana, BumbeÈti, Novaci, Èicleni, TÃ¢rgu
CÄrbuneÈti, FiliaÈi, Motru, Rovinari, Baia de AramÄ, VÃ¢nju Mare, BalÈ,
Corabia, ScorniceÈti, CÄlimÄneÈti and DrÄgÄÈani. There is a diversity of
different town types (resourced-based mining towns, old ports, rural
small towns, some tourism activities), scattered throughout the entire
region, testifying that there are multiple factors causing shrinkage.
Few of these towns have managed to keep their industrial activities due
to the strategic importance of their power plants for the production of
electricity. Most of them did not succeed to foster any new economic
activities, nor modernise traditional branches, so there were no major
new investments since the 1980s. This situation may be partially
attributed to the towns location and poor accessibility, but also lack
of entrepreneurial culture and poor administration that was hardly able
to cope with the economic decline and transition to the market economy.

A stagnant/stabilized shrinkage was noted for ten towns (Figure
[6](#figure:shrinking)). Some of these towns have kept and developed
some forms of tourism activities (holiday homes, private camps,
accommodation and leisure facilities), benefiting from considerable
investments following various programmes financed by the EU for
fostering the tourism sector.

Small towns that relied heavily on agriculture, forestry or mining
activities will continue to be affected by shrinking, which will
definitely put a stain on their physical and social structure, the need
for viable alternatives to smart shrinkage being of utmost importance.

This analysis provides empirical confirmation that many small towns in
Oltenia are in fact shrinking, despite different economic and
demographic background, and that mainly the demographic indicators
(population decrease, out-migration and ageing), followed by economic
ones, are the most important factors for urban shrinkage in the region.
However, these towns do not only face loses of population, but also a
mismatch between the physical urban structure and the population needs.

What are the main causes for shrinking in the case of small and medium
towns in Oltenia? After analysing the situation in other European
countries, we can definitely say that the experience of this region has
some specifics, as the urban shrinkage is not caused by suburbanization
and to a larger extent, neither by deindustrialization. In 1992, most
(3/4) of the small and medium-small towns in the region had a location
quotient of industry below the urban average of 1.029
[@popescu_deindustrialization_2014], which might in part explain this
situation. Moreover, these towns were ranked much lower in the urban
hierarchy and had limited economic options, hosting mainly local
resource-based industries.

Shrinking is rather caused by the overlapping of simultaneous
demographic processes - out-migration, drops in birth rates, ageing
(which leads to population decline) and economic difficulties (loss of
jobs, lack of private companies, lack of entrepreneurial culture, heavy
reliance on agriculture and subsidies from the government).

The current study provides a critical analysis on the extent of
shrinking phenomenon that severely affects more than a third of the
small and medium-size towns in the region of Oltenia and the outcomes of
the post-socialist urban changes. In the long run, this shrinkage will
definitely affect labour and the social and technical infrastructure,
putting a great strain on the local budgets.

# Conclusions

During the last decade, the issue of *shrinking cities* is pervasive for
the research interest of academics and the political discourse of many
countries. Unfortunately, despite the evident urban decline of small
Romanian towns, from both the economic and demographic perspective
during the last 3 decades, the politicians and authorities seem to miss
the extent of this phenomenon, which has become rather common in Romania
and Oltenia region as well.

The decrease in size of the population, the increase of the mean age and
the ageing of the population has repercussions on the economy by
reducing the labour force. It also influences the values of social
criteria directly influencing the number of households, number of
schools or the school population. The evolution of settlements may also
correlate with the local factors like their proximity to a disfavoured
area or to a dominantly rural area.

The thirteen indicators taken into consideration reflect demographic,
economic and social aspects that point to vulnerabilities and lack of
adaptability in Romanian shrinking cities [@banica_challenges_2017]
rather than to aspects of resilience capacity. Also, the indicators were
thought-out to be used as a base-model in analysing the dimension of a
complex phenomenon like urban shrinking for other case studies which may
include larger urban settlements. Of course, depending on other factors,
the indicators considered for analysis may be modified. The three types
of shrinkage testify for the existence of different patterns (rhythms,
trajectories, effects), which means that there is no miracle solution
that could be applied to all the towns.

What are the alternatives for smart urban shrinkage? Considering that
shrinking is seldom a rapid process, and it rather takes place over
generations, providing the luxury of time to adapt the planning and
designing process, the condition of shrinking does not have to be a
terminal diagnosis for a small town [@fugate_shrinking_2007]. Numerous
studies point to the need for the involvement of communities to promote
the principle of re-growing smaller and more sustainable. Another
solution might focus on the assumed decision for turning to rural,
considering the opportunity of using European funds and projects for
rural development.

There are no policies for shrinking cities at national or regional
level, despite the numerous strategies for sustainable development,
which fail to acknowledge the extent and severity of this phenomenon,
affecting mainly small and medium-size towns. All the strategies for
development seem to disregard the context and consequences of urban
shrinkage, choosing to focus instead mainly on economic growth, which
seems to evade almost all these towns during the last decades. These
towns lack any capacity to cope with the consequences of urban
shrinkage, their development strategies lacking both awareness and
preparedness to actively respond to this issue.
