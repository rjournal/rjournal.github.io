title: Measuring the Extent and Patterns of Urban Shrinkage for Small Towns Using
  R
abstract: 'Urban shrinking is a phenomenon as common as urban expansion nowadays and
  it affects urban settlements of all sizes, especially from developed and industrialized
  countries in Europe, America and Asia. The paper aims to assess the patterns of
  shrinkage for small and medium sized towns in Oltenia region (Romania), considering
  demographic, economic and social indicators with a methodological approach which
  considers the use of different functions and applications of R packages. Thirteen
  selected indicators are analysed to perform the multivariate analysis on Principal
  Component Analysis using the prcomp() function and the [ggplot2](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=ggplot2)
  package to visualize the patterns of urban shrinkage. Two composite indicators were
  additionally created to measure the extent of urban shrinkage: CSI (Composite Shrinking
  Index) and RDC (Regional Demographic Change) for two-time intervals. Based on the
  CSI, three major categories of shrinking were observed: persistent shrinkage, mild
  shrinking or slow evolution toward shrinking, where the vast majority of towns are
  found (including mining towns, where there still is a delayed restructuring of state-owned
  enterprises, and towns characterised by the agrarization of local economies), and
  stagnant/stabilized shrinkage.'
