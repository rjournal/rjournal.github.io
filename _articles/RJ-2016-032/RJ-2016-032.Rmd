title: Design of the TRONCO BioConductor Package for TRanslational ONCOlogy
abstract: Models of cancer progression provide insights on the order of accumulation
  of genetic alterations during cancer development. Algorithms to infer such models
  from the currently available mutational profiles collected from different cancer
  patients (cross-sectional data) have been defined in the literature since late the
  90s. These algorithms differ in the way they extract a graphical model of the events
  modelling the progression, e.g., somatic mutations or copy-number alterations. TRONCO
  is an R package for TRanslational ONcology which provides a series of functions
  to assist the user in the analysis of cross-sectional genomic data and, in particular,
  it implements algorithms that aim to model cancer progression by means of the notion
  of selective advantage. These algorithms are proved to outperform the current state-of-the-art
  in the inference of cancer progression models. TRONCO also provides functionalities
  to load input cross-sectional data, set up the execution of the algorithms, assess
  the statistical confidence in the results, and visualize the models. Availability.
