title: 'SurvBoost: An R Package for High-Dimensional Variable Selection in the Stratified
  Proportional Hazards Model via Gradient Boosting'
abstract: High-dimensional variable selection in the proportional hazards (PH) model
  has many successful applications in different areas. In practice, data may involve
  confounding variables that do not satisfy the PH assumption, in which case the stratified
  proportional hazards (SPH) model can be adopted to control the confounding effects
  by stratification without directly modeling the confounding effects. However, there
  is a lack of computationally efficient statistical software for high-dimensional
  variable selection in the SPH model. In this work an R package, SurvBoost, is developed
  to implement the gradient boosting algorithm for fitting the SPH model with high-dimensional
  covariate variables. Simulation studies demonstrate that in many scenarios SurvBoost
  can achieve better selection accuracy and reduce computational time substantially
  compared to the existing R package that implements boosting algorithms without stratification.
  The proposed R package is also illustrated by an analysis of gene expression data
  with survival outcome in The Cancer Genome Atlas study. In addition, a detailed
  hands-on tutorial for SurvBoost is provided.
