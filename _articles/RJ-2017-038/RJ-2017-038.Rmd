title: 'ctmcd: An R Package for Estimating the Parameters of a Continuous-Time Markov
  Chain from Discrete-Time Data'
abstract: This article introduces the R package ctmcd, which provides an implementation
  of methods for the estimation of the parameters of a continuous-time Markov chain
  given that data are only available on a discrete-time basis. This data consists
  of partial observations of the state of the chain, which are made without error
  at discrete times, an issue also known as the embedding problem for Markov chains.
  The functions provided comprise matrix logarithm based approximations as described
  in Israel et al. (2001), as well as Kreinin and Sidelnikova (2001), an expectation-maximization
  algorithm and a Gibbs sampling approach, both introduced by Bladt and Sørensen (2005).
  For the expectation maximization algorithm Wald confidence intervals based on the
  Fisher information estimation method of Oakes (1999) are provided. For the Gibbs
  sampling approach, equal-tailed credibility intervals can be obtained. In order
  to visualize the parameter estimates, a matrix plot function is provided. The methods
  described are illustrated by Standard and Poor’s discrete-time corporate credit
  rating transition data.
