title: 'mle.tools: An R Package for Maximum Likelihood Bias Correction'
abstract: 'Recently, Mazucheli (2017) uploaded the package mle.tools to CRAN. It can
  be used for bias corrections of maximum likelihood estimates through the methodology
  proposed by Cox and Snell (1968). The main function of the package, coxsnell.bc(),
  computes the bias corrected maximum likelihood estimates. Although in general, the
  bias corrected estimators may be expected to have better sampling properties than
  the uncorrected estimators, analytical expressions from the formula proposed by
  Cox and Snell (1968) are either tedious or impossible to obtain. The purpose of
  this paper is twofolded: to introduce the mle.tools package, especially the coxsnell.bc()
  function; secondly, to compare, for thirty one continuous distributions, the bias
  estimates from the coxsnell.bc() function and the bias estimates from analytical
  expressions available in the literature. We also compare, for five distributions,
  the observed and expected Fisher information. Our numerical experiments show that
  the functions are efficient to estimate the biases by the Cox-Snell formula and
  for calculating the observed and expected Fisher information.'
