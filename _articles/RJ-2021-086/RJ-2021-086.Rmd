title: 'The vote Package: Single Transferable Vote and Other Electoral Systems in
  R'
abstract: We describe the vote package in R, which implements the plurality (or first-past-the-post),
  two-round runoff, score, approval, and Single Transferable Vote (STV) electoral
  systems, as well as methods for selecting the Condorcet winner and loser. We emphasize
  the STV system, which we have found to work well in practice for multi-winner elections
  with small electorates, such as committee and council elections, and the selection
  of multiple job candidates. For single-winner elections, STV is also called Instant
  Runoff Voting (IRV), Ranked Choice Voting (RCV), or the alternative vote (AV) system.
  The package also implements the STV system with equal preferences, for the first
  time in a software package, to our knowledge. It also implements a new variant of
  STV, in which a minimum number of candidates from a specified group are required
  to be elected. We illustrate the package with several real examples.
