title: 'MoTBFs: An R Package for Learning Hybrid Bayesian Networks Using Mixtures
  of Truncated Basis Functions'
abstract: ' This paper introduces [MoTBFs](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=MoTBFs),
  an R package for manipulating mixtures of truncated basis functions. This class
  of functions allows the representation of joint probability distributions involving
  discrete and continuous variables simultaneously, and includes mixtures of truncated
  exponentials and mixtures of polynomials as special cases. The package implements
  functions for learning the parameters of univariate, multivariate, and conditional
  distributions, and provides support for parameter learning in Bayesian networks
  with both discrete and continuous variables. Probabilistic inference using forward
  sampling is also implemented. Part of the functionality of the MoTBFs package relies
  on the [bnlearn](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=bnlearn) package, which includes
  functions for learning the structure of a Bayesian network from a data set. Leveraging
  this functionality, the MoTBFs package supports learning of MoTBF-based Bayesian
  networks over hybrid domains. We give a brief introduction to the methodological
  context and algorithms implemented in the package. An extensive illustrative example
  is used to describe the package, its functionality, and its usage. '
