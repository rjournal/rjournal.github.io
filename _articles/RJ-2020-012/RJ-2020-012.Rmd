title: 'rcosmo: R Package for Analysis of Spherical, HEALPix and Cosmological Data'
abstract: The analysis of spatial observations on a sphere is important in areas such
  as geosciences, physics and embryo research, just to name a few. The purpose of
  the package rcosmo is to conduct efficient information processing, visualisation,
  manipulation and spatial statistical analysis of Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB)
  radiation and other spherical data. The package was developed for spherical data
  stored in the Hierarchical Equal Area isoLatitude Pixelation (Healpix) representation.
  rcosmo has more than 100 different functions. Most of them initially were developed
  for CMB, but also can be used for other spherical data as rcosmo contains tools
  for transforming spherical data in cartesian and geographic coordinates into the
  HEALPix representation. We give a general description of the package and illustrate
  some important functionalities and benchmarks.
