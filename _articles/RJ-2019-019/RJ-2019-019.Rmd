title: 'MDFS: MultiDimensional Feature Selection in R'
abstract: Identification of informative variables in an information system is often
  performed using simple one-dimensional filtering procedures that discard information
  about interactions between variables. Such an approach may result in removing some
  relevant variables from consideration. Here we present an R package MDFS (MultiDimensional
  Feature Selection) that performs identification of informative variables taking
  into account synergistic interactions between multiple descriptors and the decision
  variable. MDFS is an implementation of an algorithm based on information theory
  (Mnich and Rudnicki, 2017). The computational kernel of the package is implemented
  in C++. A high-performance version implemented in CUDA C is also available. The
  application of MDFS is demonstrated using the well-known Madelon dataset, in which
  a decision variable is generated from synergistic interactions between descriptor
  variables. It is shown that the application of multidimen sional analysis results
  in better sensitivity and ranking of importance.
