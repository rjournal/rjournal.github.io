title: 'Matching with Clustered Data: the CMatching Package in R'
abstract: Matching is a well known technique to balance covariates distribution between
  treated and control units in non-experimental studies. In many fields, clustered
  data are a very common occurrence in the analysis of observational data and the
  clustering can add potentially interesting information. Matching algorithms should
  be adapted to properly exploit the hierarchical structure. In this article we present
  the CMatching package implementing matching algorithms for clustered data. The package
  provides functions for obtaining a matched dataset along with estimates of most
  common parameters of interest and model-based standard errors. A propensity score
  matching analysis, relating math proficiency with homework completion for students
  belonging to different schools (based on the NELS-88 data), illustrates in detail
  the use of the algorithms.
