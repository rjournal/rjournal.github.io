title: 'ConvergenceConcepts: An R Package to Investigate Various Modes of Convergence'
abstract: 'ConvergenceConcepts is an R package, built upon the tkrplot, tcltk and
  lattice packages, designed to investigate the convergence of simulated sequences
  of random variables. Four classical modes of convergence may be studied, namely:
  almost sure convergence (a.s.), convergence in probability (P), convergence in law
  (L) and convergence in r-th mean (r). This investigation is performed through accurate
  graphical representations. This package may be used as a pedagogical tool. It may
  give students a better understanding of these notions and help them to visualize
  these difficult theoretical concepts. Moreover, some scholars could gain some insight
  into the behaviour of some random sequences they are interested in.'
