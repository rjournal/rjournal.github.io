title: 'ICSOutlier: Unsupervised Outlier Detection for Low-Dimensional Contamination
  Structure'
abstract: Detecting outliers in a multivariate and unsupervised context is an important
  and ongoing problem notably for quality control. Many statistical methods are already
  implemented in R and are briefly surveyed in the present paper. But only a few lead
  to the accurate identification of potential outliers in the case of a small level
  of contamination. In this particular context, the Invariant Coordinate Selection
  (ICS) method shows remarkable properties for identifying outliers that lie on a
  low-dimensional subspace in its first invariant components. It is implemented in
  the ICSOutlier package. The main function of the package, ics.outlier, offers the
  possibility of labelling potential outliers in a completely automated way. Four
  examples, including two real examples in quality control, illustrate the use of
  the function. Comparing with several other approaches, it appears that ICS is generally
  as efficient as its competitors and shows an advantage in the context of a small
  proportion of outliers lying in a low-dimensional subspace. In quality control,
  the method may help in properly identifying some defective products while not detecting
  too many false positives.
