title: A Unifying Framework for Parallel and Distributed Processing in R using Futures
abstract: A *future* is a programming construct designed for concurrent and asynchronous
  evaluation of code, making it particularly useful for parallel processing. The future
  package implements the *Future API* for programming with futures in R. This minimal
  API provides sufficient constructs for implementing parallel versions of well-established,
  high-level map-reduce APIs. The future ecosystem supports exception handling, output
  and condition relaying, parallel random number generation, and automatic identification
  of globals lowering the threshold to parallelize code. The *Future API* bridges
  parallel frontends with parallel backends, following the philosophy that end-users
  are the ones who choose the parallel backend while the developer focuses on what
  to parallelize. A variety of backends exist, and third-party contributions meeting
  the specifications, which ensure that the same code works on all backends, are automatically
  supported. The future framework solves several problems not addressed by other parallel
  frameworks in R.
