title: 'ari: The Automated R Instructor'
abstract: We present the ari package for automatically generating technology-focused
  educational videos. The goal of the package is to create reproducible videos, with
  the ability to change and update video content seamlessly. We present several examples
  of generating videos including using R Markdown slide decks, PowerPoint slides,
  or simple images as source material. We also discuss how ari can help instructors
  reach new audiences through programmatically translating materials into other languages.
