title: 'CryptRndTest: An R Package for Testing the Cryptographic Randomness'
abstract: In this article, we introduce the R package CryptRndTest that performs eight
  statistical randomness tests on cryptographic random number sequences. The purpose
  of the package is to provide software implementing recently proposed cryptographic
  randomness tests utilizing goodness of-fit tests superior to the usual chi-square
  test in terms of statistical performance. Most of the tests included in package
  CryptRndTest are not available in other software packages such as the R package
  RDieHarder or the C library TestU01. Chi-square, Anderson-Darling, Kolmogorov-Smirnov,
  and Jarque-Bera goodness-of-fit procedures are provided along with cryptographic
  randomness tests. CryptRndTest utilizes multiple precision floating numbers for
  sequences longer than 64-bit based on the package Rmpfr. By this way, included tests
  are applied precisely for higher bit-lengths. In addition CryptRndTest provides
  a user friendly interface to these cryptographic randomness tests. As an illustrative
  application, CryptRndTest is used to test available random number generators in
  R.
