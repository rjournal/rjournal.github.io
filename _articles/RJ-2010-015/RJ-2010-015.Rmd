title: 'cudaBayesreg: Bayesian Computation in CUDA'
abstract: Graphical processing units are rapidly gaining maturity as powerful general
  parallel comput ing devices. The package cudaBayesreg uses GPUâ€“oriented procedures
  to improve the performance of Bayesian computations. The paper motivates the need
  for devising high-performance computing strategies in the context of fMRI data analysis.
  Some features of the package for Bayesian analysis of brain fMRI data are illustrated.
  Comparative computing performance figures between sequential and parallel implementations
  are presented as well.
