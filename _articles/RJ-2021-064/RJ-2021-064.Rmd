title: g2f as a Novel Tool to Find and Fill Gaps in Metabolic Networks
abstract: During the building of a genome-scale metabolic model, there are several
  dead-end metabo lites and substrates which cannot be imported, produced, nor used
  by any reaction incorporated in the network. The presence of these dead-end metabolites
  can block out the net flux of the objective function when it is evaluated through
  Flux Balance Analysis (FBA), and when it is not blocked, bias in the biological
  conclusions increase. In this aspect, the refinement to restore the connectivity
  of the network can be carried out manually or using computational algorithms. The
  g2f package was designed as a tool to find the gaps from dead-end metabolites and
  fill them from the stoichiometric reactions of a reference, filtering candidate
  reactions using a weighting function. Additionally, this algorithm allows downloading
  all the sets of gene-associated stoichiometric reactions for a specific organism
  from the KEGG database. Our package is compatible with both 4.0.0 and 3.6.0 R versions.
