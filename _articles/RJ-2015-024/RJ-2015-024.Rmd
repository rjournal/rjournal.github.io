title: 'An R Package for the Panel Approach Method for Program Evaluation: pampe'
abstract: The pampe package for R implements the panel data approach method for program
  evalua tion designed to estimate the causal effects of political interventions or
  treatments. This procedure exploits the dependence among cross-sectional units to
  construct a counterfactual of the treated unit(s), and it is an appropriate method
  for research events that occur at an aggregate level like countries or regions and
  that affect only one or a small number of units. The implementation of the pampe
  package is illustrated using data from Hong Kong and 24 other units, by examining
  the economic impact of the political and economic integration of Hong Kong with
  mainland China in 1997 and 2004 respectively.
