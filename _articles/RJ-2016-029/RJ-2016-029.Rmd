title: 'sbtools: A Package Connecting R to Cloud-based Data for Collaborative Online
  Research'
abstract: The adoption of high-quality tools for collaboration and reproducibile research
  such as R and Github is becoming more common in many research fields. While Github
  and other version management systems are excellent resources, they were originally
  designed to handle code and scale poorly to large text-based or binary datasets.
  A number of scientific data repositories are coming online and are often focused
  on dataset archival and publication. To handle collaborative workflows using large
  scientific datasets, there is increasing need to connect cloud-based online data
  storage to R. In this article, we describe how the new R package sbtools enables
  direct access to the advanced online data functionality provided by ScienceBase,
  the U.S. Geological Surveyâ€™s online scientific data storage platform.
