title: 'carx: an R Package to Estimate Censored Autoregressive Time Series with Exogenous
  Covariates '
abstract: We implement in the R package carx a novel and computationally efficient
  quasi-likelihood method for estimating a censored autoregressive model with exogenous
  covariates. The proposed quasi-likelihood method reduces to maximum likelihood estimation
  in absence of censoring. The carx package contains many useful functions for practical
  data analysis with censored stochastic regression, including functions for outlier
  detection, model diagnostics, and prediction with censored time series data. We
  illustrate the capabilities of the carx package with simulations and an elaborate
  real data analysis.
