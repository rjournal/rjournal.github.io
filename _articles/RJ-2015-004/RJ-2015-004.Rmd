title: 'rdrobust: An R Package for Robust Nonparametric Inference in Regression-Discontinuity
  Designs'
abstract: 'This article describes the R package rdrobust, which provides data-driven
  graphical and in ference procedures for RD designs. The package includes three main
  functions: rdrobust, rdbwselect and rdplot. The first function (rdrobust) implements
  conventional local-polynomial RD treatment effect point estimators and confidence
  intervals, as well as robust bias-corrected confidence intervals, for average treatment
  effects at the cutoff. This function covers sharp RD, sharp kink RD, fuzzy RD and
  fuzzy kink RD designs, among other possibilities. The second function (rdbwselect)
  implements several bandwidth selectors proposed in the RD literature. The third
  function (rdplot) provides data-driven optimal choices of evenly-spaced and quantile-spaced
  partition sizes, which are used to implement several data-driven RD plots.'
