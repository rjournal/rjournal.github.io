# Introduction

The regression-discontinuity (RD) design is a widely employed
quasi-experimental research design in social, behavioral and related
sciences; for reviews see @Imbens-Lemieux_2008_JoE and
@Lee-Lemieux_2010_JEL. In this design, units are assigned to treatment
based on whether their value of an observed covariate is above or below
a known cutoff, and the probability of receiving treatment conditional
on this covariate jumps discontinuously at the cutoff. This jump induces
"variation" in treatment assignment that may be regarded, under
appropriate assumptions, as being unrelated to potential confounders.
Thus, inference in RD designs is typically conducted using only
observations near the cutoff or threshold, where the discontinuous
change in the probability of treatment assignment occurs. Due to its
local nature, RD average treatment effects estimators are usually
constructed using local-polynomial nonparametric regression, and
statistical inference is based on large-sample approximations.

This article gives an introduction to the R package
[*rdrobust*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=rdrobust) [@rdrobust],
which offers an array of data-driven local-polynomial and
partitioning-based inference procedures for RD designs. We introduce
three main functions implementing several data-driven nonparametric
point and confidence intervals estimators, bandwidth selectors, and
plotting procedures useful for RD empirical applications:

-   `rdrobust`(). This function implements the bias-corrected robust (to
    "large" bandwidth choices) inference procedure proposed by
    @Calonico-Cattaneo-Titiunik_2014_ECMA [CCT hereafter], as well as
    many other RD inference procedures employing local-polynomial
    regression. The function `rdrobust` offers bias-corrected robust
    confidence intervals for average treatment effects at the cutoff for
    sharp RD, sharp kink RD, fuzzy RD and fuzzy kink RD designs.

-   `rdbwselect`(). This function implements several data-driven
    bandwidth selectors for RD designs based on the recent work of
    @Imbens-Kalyanaraman_2012_REStud [IK hereafter] and CCT. Although
    this command may be used as a stand-alone bandwidth selector in RD
    applications, its main purpose is to provide fully data-driven
    bandwidth choices to be used by our main function `rdrobust()`.

-   `rdplot`(). This function implements several data-driven optimal
    choices of evenly-spaced and quantile-spaced bins, which are useful
    to produce RD plots that either approximate the regression function
    by local sample averages or represent the overall variability of the
    data in a disciplined way. These optimal choices are based on an
    integrated mean squared error expansion of appropriately constructed
    partitioning estimators, as discussed in
    @Calonico-Cattaneo-Titiunik_2015_JASA; see also
    @Cattaneo-Farrell_2013_JoE for related results. These binned sample
    means and partition size chosen are used to construct the popular RD
    plots commonly found in RD applications in a fully automatic way.

We first provide a brief review of all the methods implemented in
*rdrobust*, and then discuss an empirical illustration using some of the
features of our functions `rdrobust()`, `rdbwselect()` and `rdplot()`. A
full description of the capabilities of the package *rdrobust* is
available in its manual and help files. A companion Stata [@Stata13]
package is described in @Calonico-Cattaneo-Titiunik_2014_Stata.

# Review of methods {#section:methods}

We now present the basic RD framework, describe the population
parameters of interest, introduce the local-polynomial based estimators,
review different inference procedures, and briefly summarize the popular
RD plots. Regularity conditions and other technical aspects underlying
the estimands and estimators may be found in the references given
throughout. Recent results and further details on RD designs are
discussed in IK and CCT (see also the supplemental appendix), and
references therein.

## Setup and notation

We adopt the potential outcomes framework commonly employed in the
treatment effects literature (e.g., @Heckman-Vytlacil_2007_Handbook and
@Imbens-Wooldridge_2009_JEL). Let $\{(Y_i(0),Y_i(1),T_i(0),T_i(1),$
$X_i)' : i=1,2,\ldots,n\}$ be a random sample from
$(Y(0),Y(1),T(0),T(1),X)'$, where $Y(1)$ and $Y(0)$ denote the potential
outcomes with and without treatment, respectively, $T(0)$ and $T(1)$
denote potential treatment status, and the scalar regressor
$X_i\in\mathbb{R}$ is the so-called "running variable" or "score"
determining treatment assignment based on whether it exceeds a known
cutoff. In particular, unit $i$ is assigned treatment if $X_i>\bar{x}$
and not assigned treatment if $X_i<\bar{x}$, for some known fixed value
$\bar{x}\in\mathbb{R}$. $f(x)$ denotes the continuous (Lebesgue) density
of $X_i$.

This setup allows for imperfect compliance, which in the RD literature
is known as the *fuzzy RD design*. The case of perfect treatment
compliance is usually called the *sharp RD design*. In either case, the
observed outcome and treatment status are, respectively, $$Y_i =\left\{ 
    \begin{array}{ccl}
    Y_i(0) && \text{if } X_i<\bar{x} \\ 
    Y_i(1) && \text{if } X_i\ge\bar{x}\\ 
    \end{array}
\right.\qquad \text{and} \qquad
T_i =\left\{ 
    \begin{array}{ccl}
    T_i(0) && \text{if } X_i<\bar{x}\\ 
    T_i(1) && \text{if } X_i\ge\bar{x}\\ 
    \end{array}
\right..$$

The observed data is $\{(Y_i,T_i,X_i)' : i=1,2,\ldots,n\}$, a random
sample from a large population. In sharp RD designs,
$T_i=\mathbb{1}(X_i\ge\bar{x})$ with $\mathbb{1}(\cdot)$ denoting the
indicator function, which leads to
$\mathbb{P}[T_i=0|X_i<\bar{x}]=1=\mathbb{P}[T_i=1|X_i\ge\bar{x}]$. More
generally, in fuzzy RD designs, treatment assignment and treatment
status may differ (imperfect compliance). Therefore, for each unit $i$,
the scalar random variable $Y_i\in\mathbb{R}$ denotes the outcome of
interest, and $T_i\in\{0,1\}$ denotes actual treatment take-up ($T_i=1$
treatment taken, $T_i=0$ treatment not taken).

We introduce some additional notation. For
$\nu\in\mathbb{Z}_+=\{0,1,2,\ldots\}$, define
$$\mu_{Y+}^{(\nu)}(\bar{x})=\lim_{x\to\bar{x}^+}\frac{\partial^\nu}{\partial x^\nu} \mu_{Y+}(x),\qquad
   \mu_{Y-}^{(\nu)}(\bar{x})=\lim_{x\to\bar{x}^-}\frac{\partial^\nu}{\partial x^\nu} \mu_{Y-}(x),$$
with $\mu_{Y+}(x)=\mathbb{E}[Y(1)|X=x]$ and
$\mu_{Y-}(x)=\mathbb{E}[Y(0)|X=x]$, and
$$\mu_{T+}^{(\nu)}(\bar{x})=\lim_{x\to\bar{x}^+}\frac{\partial^\nu}{\partial x^\nu} \mu_{T+}(x),\qquad
   \mu_{T-}^{(\nu)}(\bar{x})=\lim_{x\to\bar{x}^-}\frac{\partial^\nu}{\partial x^\nu} \mu_{T-}(x),$$
with $\mu_{T+}(x)=\mathbb{E}[T(1)|X=x]$ and
$\mu_{T-}(x)=\mathbb{E}[T(0)|X=x]$. Whenever there is no ambiguity, we
drop the subindex denoting the dependent variable or the point of
evaluation in the conditional expectations and other functions.

## Population parameters of interest

We focus on average treatment effects at the cutoff in the sharp RD,
fuzzy RD, sharp kink RD and fuzzy kink RD designs, although the results
cover other possibilities. For further details on the interpretation of
these estimands and regularity conditions see, among others,
[@Hahn-Todd-vanderKlaauw_2001_ECMA], @Porter_2003_wp, @Lee_2008_JoE, IK,
CCT, [@Card-Lee-Pei-Weber_2014_wp], and references therein.

-   **Sharp RD designs**. Two popular parameters of interest are the
    sharp RD average treatment effect at the threshold, denoted by
    $\tau_0$, and the sharp kink RD average treatment effect at the
    threshold, denoted by $\tau_1/\kappa$, with $\kappa$ a known scale
    constant, and using the generic notation:
    $$\tau_\nu := \tau_{Y,\nu}(\bar{x}) = \left.\frac{\partial^\nu}{\partial x^\nu}\mathbb{E}[Y_i(1)-Y_i(0)|X_i=x]\right|_{x=\bar{x}}
                = \mu^{(\nu)}_{Y+} - \mu^{(\nu)}_{Y-},\qquad \nu\in\mathbb{Z}_+,$$
    where the definition drops the subindex denoting the dependent
    random variable and evaluation point for notational simplicity. The
    last equality is a nonparametric identification result that holds
    under mild continuity conditions: the parameter $\tau_\nu$ can be
    written as a function of observed data because
    $\mu^{(\nu)}_{Y+}=\mu^{(\nu)}_{Y+}(\bar{x})$ and
    $\mu^{(\nu)}_{Y-}=\mu^{(\nu)}_{Y-}(\bar{x})$ are estimable from the
    observed data; $\tau_\nu=\tau_{Y,\nu}$ is a difference of two
    (one-sided) nonparametric regression functions at $\bar{x}$.

-   **Fuzzy RD designs**. The parameters of interest take the form
    $$\varsigma_\nu := \varsigma_\nu(\bar{x}) 
          = \frac{\left.\frac{\partial^\nu}{\partial x^\nu}\mathbb{E}[Y_i(1)-Y_i(0)|X_i=x]\right|_{x=\bar{x}}}
                 {\left.\frac{\partial^\nu}{\partial x^\nu}\mathbb{E}[T_i(1)-T_i(0)|X_i=x]\right|_{x=\bar{x}}}
          = \frac{\tau_{Y,\nu}}{\tau_{T,\nu}} = \frac{\mu^{(\nu)}_{Y+} - \mu^{(\nu)}_{Y-}}{\mu^{(\nu)}_{T+} - \mu^{(\nu)}_{T-}},
       \qquad \nu\in\mathbb{Z}_+,$$ where the last two equalities
    represent a nonparametric identification result that holds under
    mild continuity conditions. Note that
    $\mu^{(\nu)}_{Y+}=\mu^{(\nu)}_{Y+}(\bar{x})$,
    $\mu^{(\nu)}_{Y-}=\mu^{(\nu)}_{Y-}(\bar{x})$,
    $\mu^{(\nu)}_{T+}=\mu^{(\nu)}_{T+}(\bar{x})$ and
    $\mu^{(\nu)}_{T-}=\mu^{(\nu)}_{T-}(\bar{x})$ are all estimable from
    the observed data, since $\tau_{Y,\nu}$ and $\tau_{T,\nu}$ are each
    a difference of two (one-sided) regression functions at $\bar{x}$,
    and $\varsigma_\nu$ is just their ratio. In the RD literature, the
    two main parameters of interest are $\varsigma_0$, the fuzzy RD
    average treatment effect at the cutoff, and $\varsigma_1$, the fuzzy
    kink RD average treatment effect at the cutoff.

## Local polynomial estimators

Statistical inference in the RD design reduces to nonparametric
regression inference at the induced boundary point $\bar{x}$, employing
observations at either side of the threshold separately.
Local-polynomial estimators have become the preferred choice of
nonparametric estimator in the RD literature because of their excellent
boundary properties [@Fan-Gijbels_1996_Book]. The package *rdrobust*
implements local polynomial estimators of various orders for the two
variables $Y_i$ and $T_i$ depending on the RD design considered, and
also includes different bandwidths selectors and alternative confidence
intervals estimators. All these features are briefly reviewed in the
following subsections, but first we introduce the local polynomial RD
estimators of order $p$ in general. To reduce repetition, we describe
the estimators using a generic outcome variable $Z$ which either takes
the value $Y$ or $T$, depending on the outcome variable under
consideration. For $Z\in\{Y,T\}$ and $\nu,p\in\mathbb{Z}_+$ with
$\nu\le p$,
$$\hat\tau_{Z,\nu,p}(x;h_n) = \hat\mu^{(\nu)}_{Z+,p}(x;h_n)-\hat\mu^{(\nu)}_{Z-,p}(x;h_n),$$
$$\hat\mu^{(\nu)}_{Z+,p}(x;h_n)=\mathbf{e}_\nu'\hat{\boldsymbol{\beta}}_{Z+,p}(x;h_n) \qquad\text{and}\qquad \hat{\mu}^{(\nu)}_{Z-,p}(x;h_n)=\mathbf{e}_\nu'\hat{\boldsymbol{\beta}}_{Z-,p}(x;h_n),$$
$$\hat{\boldsymbol{\beta}}_{Z+,p}(x;h_n)=\arg\min_{\boldsymbol{\beta}\in\mathbb{R}^{p+1}}\sum_{i=1}^n\mathbb{1}(X_i\ge x)(Z_i-\mathbf{r}_p(X_i-x)'\boldsymbol{\beta})^2 K_{h_n}(X_i-x),$$
$$\hat{\boldsymbol{\beta}}_{Z-,p}(x;h_n)=\arg\min_{\boldsymbol{\beta}\in\mathbb{R}^{p+1}}\sum_{i=1}^n\mathbb{1}(X_i<x)(Z_i-\mathbf{r}_p(X_i-x)'\boldsymbol{\beta})^2 K_{h_n}(X_i-x),$$
where here $\mathbf{r}_p(x)=(1,x,\ldots,x^p)'$, $\mathbf{e}_\nu$ is the
conformable ($\nu+1$)-th unit vector (e.g., $\mathbf{e}_1=(0,1,0)'$ if
$p=2$), $K_h(u)=K(u/h)/h$ with $K(\cdot)$ a kernel function and $h_n$ is
a positive bandwidth sequence.

Using the generic notation above, the sharp RD estimators are:
$$\hat\tau_{\nu,p}(h_n):=\hat\tau_{Y,\nu,p}(\bar{x};h_n), \qquad \nu\le p.$$
Similarly, for the fuzzy RD designs we have the RD estimators:
$$\hat\varsigma_{\nu,p}(h_n):=\frac{\hat\tau_{Y,\nu,p}(h_n)}{\hat\tau_{T,\nu,p}(h_n)},\qquad \hat\tau_{Y,\nu,p}(h_n):=\hat\tau_{Y,\nu,p}(\bar{x};h_n),\qquad \hat\tau_{T,\nu,p}(h_n):=\hat\tau_{T,\nu,p}(\bar{x};h_n), \qquad \nu\le p.$$

Assuming the bandwidth $h_n\to 0$ and other regularity conditions hold,
consistency of these estimators follows easily from well-known
properties of local polynomial estimators. In applications, the most
common choices are $p=1$ for $\tau_0$ (local-linear sharp RD estimator),
$p=2$ for $\tau_1$ (local-quadratic sharp kink RD estimator), $p=1$ for
$\varsigma_0$ (local-linear fuzzy RD estimator), and $p=2$ for
$\varsigma_1$ (local-quadratic fuzzy kink RD estimator).

The function `rdrobust()` implements the above RD point estimators with
options `c` to set $\bar{x}$, `deriv` to set $\nu$, `p` to set $p$,
`kernel` to set $K(\cdot)$, and `h` to set $h_n$, among others.

## Bandwidth selectors

The main obstacle in the practical implementation of RD local polynomial
estimators is bandwidth selection. The package *rdrobust* implements the
main two approaches for bandwidth selection available in the literature:
(i) plug-in rules based on mean squared error (MSE) expansions, and (ii)
cross validation. IK provide a comprehensive review of these approaches.

-   **Direct plug-in rules**. Direct plug-in (DPI) approaches to
    bandwidth selection are based on a mean squared error (MSE)
    expansion of the sharp RD estimators, leading to the MSE-optimal
    choice
    $$h_{\mathtt{MSE},\nu,p} = C_{\mathtt{MSE},\nu,p} \; n^{-\frac{1}{2p+3}},\qquad
       C_{\mathtt{MSE},\nu,p} = \left(\frac{(1+2\nu)\mathsf{V}_{\nu,p}}{2(p+1-\nu)\mathsf{B}_{\nu,p}^2}\right)^{\frac{1}{2p+3}},$$
    where $\mathsf{B}_{\nu,p}$ and $\mathsf{V}_{\nu,p}$ are the leading
    asymptotic bias and variance of the RD estimator, respectively.

    The package *rdrobust* implements two data-driven versions of this
    MSE-optimal bandwidth, one proposed by IK (available for $\nu=0$
    only) and the other proposed by CCT (valid for all choices of
    $\nu$). Both implementations include regularization as originally
    discussed in IK, although the option `scalereg` allows users to
    remove it. The IK implementation, denoted by
    $\hat{h}_{\texttt{IK},0,p}$, may be viewed as a nonparametric
    first-generation plug-in rule [e.g., @Wand-Jones_1995_Book],
    sometimes called a DPI-1 (direct plug-in of order 1) selector. The
    CCT implementation, denoted by $\hat{h}_{\texttt{CCT},\nu,p}$, may
    be viewed as a second-generation plug-in bandwidth selection
    approach. Further details on implementation of the bandwidth
    selectors may be found in IK, CCT and their supplemental materials.

-   **Cross validation**. This bandwidth choice is implemented as
    follows:
    $$\hat{h}_{\texttt{CV},p}=\arg \min_{h>0}\mathsf{CV}_\delta(h), \qquad \mathsf{CV}_\delta(h)=\sum_{i=1}^{n}\mathbb{1}(X_{-,[\delta]}\leq X_i \leq X_{+,[\delta]})\left(Y_i-\hat\mu_p\left(X_i;h\right)\right)^2,$$
    where 
    
    $$\hat\mu_p(x;h) =\left\{\begin{eqnarray}
    \mathbf{e}_0'\hat{\boldsymbol{\beta}}_{Y+,p}(x,h) && \text{if } x>\bar{x}\\
    \mathbf{e}_0'\hat{\boldsymbol{\beta}}_{Y-,p}(x,h) && \text{if } x<\bar{x}
    \end{eqnarray}
    \right. ,$$

    
    and, for $\delta \in (0,1)$,
    $X_{-,[\delta]}$ and $X_{+,[\delta]}$ denote the $\delta$-th
    quantile of $\{X_i:X_i<\bar{x}\}$ and $\{X_i:X_i>\bar{x}\}$,
    respectively. See IK for further discussion on this alternative
    approach, which is valid only for sharp RD designs ($\nu=0$).

The function `rdbwselect()` implements the above bandwidth selectors.

## Asymptotic properties and confidence intervals

We briefly review the main asymptotic properties of the local polynomial
RD estimators, with particular emphasis on the properties of the
associated confidence interval estimators. Specifically, we discuss
three types of confidence intervals (CI) based on Gaussian
approximations: (i) conventional CI (assuming "small" bias), (ii)
bias-corrected CI (not necessarily requiring undersmoothing), and (iii)
robust bias-corrected CI (not necessarily requiring undersmoothing).

-   **Optimal point estimators**. The package *rdrobust* implements the
    following data-driven RD treatment effect point estimators.
    $$\begin{aligned}
    \text{Sharp RD:} &\qquad \hat\tau_{\nu,p}(\hat{h}_{\texttt{CCT},\nu,p}), \qquad \hat\tau_{0,p}(\hat{h}_{\texttt{IK},0,p}), \qquad \hat\tau_{0,p}(\hat{h}_{\texttt{CV},p}), \qquad \nu\le p.\\
    \text{Fuzzy RD:} &\qquad \hat\varsigma_{\nu,p}(\hat{h}_{\texttt{CCT},\nu,p}), \qquad \hat\varsigma_{0,p}(\hat{h}_{\texttt{IK},0,p}), \qquad \hat\varsigma_{0,p}(\hat{h}_{\texttt{CV},p}),\qquad \nu\le p.
    \end{aligned}$$ These estimators are constructed employing
    MSE-optimal bandwidth choices for the sharp RD case, which means
    that $\hat\tau_{\nu,p}(\hat{h}_{\texttt{CCT},\nu,p})$,
    $\hat\tau_{0,p}(\hat{h}_{\texttt{IK},0,p})$ and
    $\hat\tau_{0,p}(\hat{h}_{\texttt{CV},p})$ may be interpreted as
    consistent and (asymptotically) MSE-optimal point estimators of
    $\tau_\nu$. For the fuzzy RD cases, the bandwidth choices employed
    are technically optimal only for the numerator of the estimators,
    but since the rate of the MSE-optimal bandwidth choice does not
    differ from the sharp RD case, the estimators
    $\hat\varsigma_{\nu,p}(\hat{h}_{\texttt{CCT},\nu,p})$,
    $\hat\varsigma_{0,p}(\hat{h}_{\texttt{IK},\nu,p})$ and
    $\hat\varsigma_{0,p}(\hat{h}_{\texttt{CV},p})$ may also be viewed as
    consistent and (asymptotically) MSE-optimal point estimators of
    $\varsigma_\nu$.

-   **Sharp RD confidence intervals**. Confidence intervals accompanying
    the point estimators discussed above rely on the following
    distributional approximation:

    $$\label{eq:clt}  
    \sqrt{nh^{1+2\nu}_n}\left(\hat\tau_{\nu,p}(h_n)-\tau_\nu-h_n^{p+1-\nu}\;\mathsf{B}_{\nu,p}\right) \to_{\text{d}}\mathcal{N}(0,\mathsf{V}_{\nu,p}), \qquad \nu\le p,  (\#eq:clt)  $$

    where $\mathsf{B}_{\nu,p}$ and $\mathsf{V}_{\nu,p}$ denote,
    respectively, the asymptotic bias and variance of the RD estimator.

    [Conventional confidence intervals]{.underline}. An asymptotic
    $100(1-\alpha)$-percent confidence interval for $\tau_\nu$ is
    $$\mathsf{CI}_{1-\alpha}(h_n) = \left[ \; \hat\tau_{\nu,p}(h_n)\pm\Phi^{-1}_{1-\alpha/2} \; \sqrt{\frac{\mathsf{V}_{\nu,p}}{nh^{1+2\nu}_n}} \; \right],$$
    where $\Phi^{-1}_a$ denotes the appropriate quantile of the Gaussian
    distribution (e.g., $1.96$ for $a=.975$). This approach is valid
    only if the leading bias in (\@ref(eq:clt)) is "small". This
    smoothing bias is ignored by relying on an "undersmoothing"
    argument, that is, by assuming the bandwidth chosen is "small"
    enough so that the bias is negligible. In practice, however, this
    procedure may be difficult to implement because most bandwidth
    selectors, such as $h_{\mathtt{MSE},\nu,p}$, will not satisfy the
    conditions required for undersmoothing. This fact implies that most
    empirical bandwidth selectors could in principle lead to a
    non-negligible leading bias in the distributional approximation,
    which in turn will bias the associated confidence intervals.

    [Bias-corrected confidence intervals]{.underline}. As an alternative
    to undersmoothing, we can directly bias-correct the estimator by
    constructing an estimator of $\mathsf{B}_{\nu,p}$, which is then
    subtracted from the RD point estimate in an attempt to eliminate the
    leading bias in (\@ref(eq:clt)). The resulting asymptotic
    $100(1-\alpha)$-percent confidence interval for $\tau_\nu$ is
    $$\mathsf{CI}^\texttt{bc}_{1-\alpha}(h_n,b_n) = \left[\left(\hat\tau_{\nu,p}(h_n)-h_n^{p+1-\nu}\;\hat{\mathsf{B}}_{\nu,p,q}\right)\pm\Phi^{-1}_{1-\alpha/2}\;\sqrt{\frac{\mathsf{V}_{\nu,p}}{nh^{1+2\nu}_n}} \right],$$
    where $\hat{\mathsf{B}}_{\nu,p,q}$ denotes the bias estimate, which
    is constructed using a possibly different bandwidth $b_n$. To
    implement this approach, CCT propose a MSE-optimal bandwidth choice
    of $b_n$ for the bias estimator $\hat{\mathsf{B}}_{\nu,p,q}$ taking
    the form
    $b_{\texttt{MSE},\nu,p,q}= \mathsf{C}_{\nu,p,q}^{1/(2q+3)} \; n^{-1/(2q+3)}$,
    where $\mathsf{C}_{\nu,p,q}$ denotes a constant depending on the
    data generating process. CCT also discuss an implementation
    procedure of $b_{\texttt{MSE},\nu,p,q}$, leading to the data-driven
    estimator denoted by $\hat{b}_{\texttt{CCT},\nu,p,q}$.

    [Robust bias-corrected confidence intervals]{.underline}. The
    confidence intervals discussed so far have some unappealing
    properties that may affect their performance in applications. On the
    one hand, the confidence intervals $\mathsf{CI}_{1-\alpha}(h_n)$
    require undersmoothing (or, alternatively, a "small" bias), which
    may lead to coverage distortions in cases where the bias is
    important. On the other hand, the bias-corrected confidence
    intervals $\mathsf{CI}^{\texttt{bc}}_{1-\alpha}(h_n,b_n)$, while
    theoretically justified for a larger range of bandwidths, are
    usually regarded as having poor performance in empirical settings,
    also leading to potentially large coverage distortions in
    applications.

    CCT propose an alternative, more robust confidence interval formula
    based on the bias-corrected RD treatment effect estimators, but
    employing a different variance for studentization purposes.
    Intuitively, the bias-corrected RD estimator does not perform well
    in finite-samples because the bias estimate introduces additional
    variability in the statistic, which is not accounted for when
    forming the associated confidence intervals
    $\mathsf{CI}^{\texttt{bc}}_{1-\alpha}(h_n,b_n)$. Thus, CCT propose
    the asymptotic $100(1-\alpha)$-percent confidence interval for
    $\tau_\nu$ given by
    $$\mathsf{CI}^{\texttt{rbc}}_{1-\alpha}(h_n,b_n) = \left[\left(\hat\tau_{\nu,p}(h_n)-h_n^{p+1-\nu}\;\hat{\mathsf{B}}_{\nu,p,q}\right)\pm\Phi^{-1}_{1-\alpha/2}\;\sqrt{\mathsf{V}^{\texttt{bc}}_{n,\nu,p,q}} \right],$$
    which includes the alternative variance formula
    $\mathsf{V}^{\texttt{bc}}_{n,\nu,p,q}(h_n,b_n)$ accounting for the
    additional variability introduced by the bias estimate. See CCT and
    @Calonico-Cattaneo-Farrell_2015_wp for further details.

-   **Sharp RD variance estimation**. To construct fully feasible
    confidence intervals the unknown asymptotic variance is replaced by
    a consistent estimator thereof. The asymptotic variance formulas
    introduced above have a "sandwich" structure coming from the
    weighted least-squares structure of local polynomials. The package
    *rdrobust* offers two distinct valid variance estimators, employing
    either "plug-in estimated residuals" or "fixed-matches estimated
    residuals".

    [Plug-in estimated residuals]{.underline}. In this approach, the
    unknown residuals are estimated directly using the RD local
    polynomial estimator. Usually the same bandwidth $h_n$ is employed,
    although his choice may not be optimal and could lead to poor
    finite-sample performance of the variance estimator.
    $\check{\mathsf{V}}_{n,\nu,p}$ and
    $\check{\mathsf{V}}^{\texttt{bc}}_{n,\nu,p,q}$ denote the resulting
    estimators of $\mathsf{V}_{n,\nu,p}$ and
    $\mathsf{V}^{\texttt{bc}}_{n,\nu,p,q}$, respectively.

    [Fixed-matches estimated residuals]{.underline}. CCT propose an
    alternative variance estimator employing a different construction
    for the residuals, motivated by the work of
    [@Abadie-Imbens_2006_ECMA]. This estimator is constructed using a
    simple nearest-neighbor (or fixed-matches) estimator for the
    residuals. $\hat{\mathsf{V}}_{n,\nu,p}$ and
    $\hat{\mathsf{V}}^{\texttt{bc}}_{n,\nu,p,q}$ denote the resulting
    estimators of $\mathsf{V}_{n,\nu,p}$ and
    $\mathsf{V}^{\texttt{bc}}_{n,\nu,p,q}$, respectively.

    results presented above extend to the case of fuzzy RD designs,
    which we omit here to conserve space. See IK and CCT for further
    details. The package *rdrobust* also implements fuzzy RD estimators
    and confidence intervals.

The function `rdrobust()` may be used to conduct inference in all RD
settings; by default, this function employs the function `rdbwselect()`
for bandwidth selection. Specifically, assuming $y$ is the output
variable, $t$ is the treatment status variable, $x$ is the running
variable and the cutoff is $c=0$, we have the following generic cases
(with default options and bandwidth selection procedure):

-   Sharp RD:\
    `rdrobust(y = y, x = x)`

-   Sharp Kink RD:\
    `rdrobust(y = y, x = x, deriv = 1)`

-   Fuzzy RD:\
    `rdrobust(y = y, x = x, fuzzy = t)`

-   Fuzzy Kink RD:\
    `rdrobust(y = y, x = x, fuzzy = t, deriv = 1)`

## RD plots

Because of the simplicity of the RD design, it is customary (and
advisable) to summarize the main features of the RD design in a
graphical way. The package *rdrobust* also implements the results in
@Calonico-Cattaneo-Titiunik_2015_JASA, which offer several optimal
data-driven choices of tuning parameters useful to produce several
versions of the popular RD plots. These plots present global and local
estimates of the regression functions, $\mu_{Y-}(x)$ and $\mu_{Y+}(x)$,
in an attempt to describe their shapes for control ($X_i<\bar{x})$ and
treated ($X_i\ge\bar{x}$) units. The plot typically includes two smooth
"global" polynomial regression curve estimates, for control and
treatment units separately, as well as binned sample means of the
outcome, which are included either to capture the local behavior of the
underlying regression functions or to represent the overall variability
of the raw data in a disciplined way. These binned sample means are used
to either (i) investigate whether other discontinuities are present, and
(ii) depict an informative "cloud of points" around the smooth global
polynomial fits.

The first ingredient of the RD plot (two regression curves estimated for
$X_i<\bar{x}$ and $X_i\ge\bar{x}$ separately) is easy to construct
because it requires only estimating a polynomial regression on the data;
typical choices are $4$-th and $5$-th order global polynomials. The
second ingredient of the RD plot requires computing sample means over
non-overlapping regions of the support of the running variable $X_i$ for
control and treatment units, separately. For implementation the
researcher needs to choose the number of bins to be used, denoted by
$J_{-,n}$ (control) and $J_{+,n}$ (treatment), and the length of each
bin; evenly-spaced bins is the most common partitioning scheme used.
@Calonico-Cattaneo-Titiunik_2015_JASA study the problem of selecting an
optimal number of bins $J_{-,n}$ and $J_{+,n}$ under two partitioning
schemes, evenly-spaced (ES) and quantile-spaced (QS), and propose
several consistent nonparametric selectors using spacings and polynomial
regression estimators. In particular, they propose two approaches to
select the number of bins: (i) IMSE-optimal (tailored to approximate the
underlying regression functions), and (ii) Mimicking Variance (tailored
to represent the overall variability of the data in a disciplined way).
These two proposed choices take the form, respectively,
$$\text{IMSE-optimal : }\quad J_{-,n}^* = \left\lceil\mathscr{C}_-\;n^{1/3}\right\rceil \quad\text{and}
                        \quad J_{+,n}^* = \left\lceil\mathscr{C}_+\;n^{1/3}\right\rceil,$$
and
$$\text{Mimicking Variance : }\quad J_{-,n}^* = \left\lceil\mathscr{C}_-\;\frac{n}{\log(n)^2}\right\rceil\quad\text{and}
                              \quad J_{+,n}^* = \left\lceil\mathscr{C}_+\;\frac{n}{\log(n)^2}\right\rceil,$$
where $\lceil\cdot\rceil$ denotes the ceiling function, and the unknown
constants take different values depending on the targeted method and
partitioning scheme used. Once the partitioning scheme is selected, the
optimal choices $J_{-,n}^*$ and $J_{+,n}^*$ can be estimated using
preliminary plug-in estimators of $\mathscr{C_-}$ and $\mathscr{C_+}$.

The function `rdplot()` offers eight distinct automatic implementations
for RD plots depending on (i) the choice of partitioning (ES or QS),
(ii) the goal of the plot (IMSE-optimal or Mimicking Variance), and
(iii) the estimation approach used (spacings or polynomial regression).
Specifically, the function `rdplot()` covers the following.

-   Population quantities:\
    $J_{\mathtt{ES}\text{-}\mu,\cdot,n}=$ IMSE-optimal choice with
    evenly-spaced (ES) bins.\
    $J_{\mathtt{ES}\text{-}\vartheta,\cdot,n}=$ Mimicking Variance
    choice with evenly-spaced (ES) bins.\
    $J_{\mathtt{QS}\text{-}\mu,\cdot,n}=$ IMSE-optimal choice with
    quantile-spaced (QS) bins.\
    $J_{\mathtt{QS}\text{-}\vartheta,\cdot,n}=$ Mimicking Variance
    choice with quantile-spaced (QS) bins.\

-   Estimators:\
    $\hat{J}_{\mathtt{ES}\text{-}\mu,\cdot,n}\text{ and }\hat{J}_{\mathtt{QS}\text{-}\mu,\cdot,n}=$
    spacings implementations of $J_{\mathtt{ES}\text{-}\mu,\cdot,n}$ and
    $J_{\mathtt{QS}\text{-}\mu,\cdot,n}$, respectively.\
    $\check{J}_{\mathtt{ES}\text{-}\mu,\cdot,n}\text{ and }\check{J}_{\mathtt{QS}\text{-}\mu,\cdot,n}=$
    polynomial regression implementations of
    $J_{\mathtt{ES}\text{-}\mu,\cdot,n}$ and
    $J_{\mathtt{QS}\text{-}\mu,\cdot,n}$, respectively.\
    $\hat{J}_{\mathtt{ES}\text{-}\vartheta,\cdot,n}\text{ and }\hat{J}_{\mathtt{QS}\text{-}\vartheta,\cdot,n}=$
    spacings implementations of
    $J_{\mathtt{ES}\text{-}\vartheta,\cdot,n}$ and
    $J_{\mathtt{QS}\text{-}\vartheta,\cdot,n}$, respectively.\
    $\check{J}_{\mathtt{ES}\text{-}\vartheta,\cdot,n}\text{ and }\check{J}_{\mathtt{QS}\text{-}\vartheta,\cdot,n}=$
    polynomial regression implementations of
    $J_{\mathtt{ES}\text{-}\vartheta,\cdot,n}$ and
    $J_{\mathtt{QS}\text{-}\vartheta,\cdot,n}$, respectively.\

# The *rdrobust* package: Empirical illustration {#section:package}

We employ an extract of the dataset constructed by
@Cattaneo-Frandsen-Titiunik_2015_JCI to illustrate some of the features
of our R package *rdrobust*. This dataset contains information on
elections for the U.S. Senate during the period 1914--2010. We focus on
the RD effect of the Democratic party winning a U.S. Senate seat on the
vote share obtained in the following election for that same seat,
mimicking the analysis conducted in [@Lee_2008_JoE] for the U.S. House.
The dataset `rdrobust_RDsenate` contains two variables: *vote* and
*margin*. The variable *vote* records the state-level vote share of the
Democratic party in a given statewide election for a Senate seat, while
the variable *margin* records the margin of victory of the Democratic
party in the previous election for the same Senate seat (i.e., six years
prior).

First, we load the database and present basic summary statistics. The
functions included in the R package *rdrobust* allow for missing values,
which are automatically excluded for estimation purposes.

``` r
> library(rdrobust)
> data(rdrobust_RDsenate)
> vote <- rdrobust_RDsenate$vote
> margin <- rdrobust_RDsenate$margin
> summary(vote)
   Min. 1st Qu.  Median    Mean 3rd Qu.    Max.    NA's 
   0.00   42.67   50.55   52.67   61.35  100.00      93 
> summary(margin)
    Min.  1st Qu.   Median     Mean  3rd Qu.     Max. 
-100.000  -12.210    2.166    7.171   22.770  100.000 
```

This data set has a total of $1,297$ complete observations. The variable
*margin* ranges from $-100$ to 100, and records the margin of victory in
a given election for a given U.S. Senate seat, defined as the vote share
of the Democratic party minus the vote share of the strongest opponent.
When *margin* is above zero, the Democratic party wins the election for
that seat, otherwise it loses. The variable *vote* ranges from 0 to 100
because it records the outcome of the (two-periods ahead) election for
that given seat. Thus, observations for years 2008 and 2010 have missing
*vote*. As it is usual in the literature, we exploit the discontinuity
in incumbency status that occurs at 0 on *margin* to employ an RD
design.

We use `rdplot()` to construct an automatic plot of the RD design.

``` r
> (rdplot(y = vote, x = margin, title = "RD Plot - Senate Elections Data",
+   y.label = "Vote Share in Election at time t+1", 
+   x.label = "Vote Share in Election at time t"))
Call:
rdplot(y = vote, x = margin, title = "RD Plot - Senate Elections Data", 
   x.label = "Vote Share in Election at time t", 
   y.label = "Vote Share in Election at time t+1")

FigureÂ [1](#fig:1) is constructed using the default options in the
command `rdplot`, which produce an RD plot with evenly-spaced bins
selected to mimic the underlying variability of the data and is
implemented using spacings estimators. Using the notation introduced
above, the number of optimal bins for control and treatment units are
$\hat{J}_{-,n}=15$ and $\hat{J}_{+,n}=35$, respectively, implying bin
lengths of 6.661 and 2.856 percentage points, respectively. The global
polynomial is constructed using a $4th$ degree polynomial ($p=4$ for
$\hat{\mu}_{-.p,1}(x)$ and $\hat{\mu}_{+.p,1}(x)$).

Next, we construct an alternative RD plot using evenly-spaced bins
selected to trace out the underlying regression function (i.e., using
the IMSE-optimal selector), also implemented using spacings estimators.
The resulting plot is given in FigureÂ [2](#fig:2).

``` r

While providing a good approximation to the underlying regression
function (taking the global polynomial fit as benchmark), the
IMSE-optimal number of bins will usually be too small in applications.
This happens because the optimal formulas seek to balance squared bias
and variance in order to approximate the underlying regression function
globally. To obtain a visual "cloud of points" we need to increase the
number of bins, that is, undersmooth the estimator. In other words, in
order to increase the overall variability of the plotted points, we may
reduce the bin-length -- which is done by increasing the total number of
bins used. This may be easily done using the option `scale` as follows:

``` r
> (rdplot(y = vote, x = margin, binselect = "es", scale = 5, 
+   title = "RD Plot - Senate Elections Data",
+   y.label = "Vote Share in Election at time t+1",
+   x.label = "Vote Share in Election at time t"))
Call:
rdplot(y = vote, x = margin, binselect = "es", scale = 5, 
   title = "RD Plot - Senate Elections Data", 
   x.label = "Vote Share in Election at time t", 
   y.label = "Vote Share in Election at time t+1")

FigureÂ [3](#fig:3) shows the resulting (undersmoothed) RD plot, where
now the number of bins used is five times larger than the optimal choice
in an integrated mean squared error sense. The resulting estimator is
naturally more variable than before.

Next, we conduct fully data-driven RD treatment effect estimation and
inference. The function `rdrobust()` using its default options leads to
the following output:

``` r
> rdrobust(y = vote, x = margin)

Call:
rdrobust(y = vote, x = margin)

```

These results contain a variety of information, which is organized in
three panels. The first two contain a summary of the main choices
selected to construct the RD treatment effect estimators, while the
lower panel includes the main estimation results. Specifically, using
the notation introduced above, this table shows:

1.  The total number of observations is $1,297$, with effective $343$
    control and $310$ treated units (given the bandwidth $h_n$ chosen;
    see below). The estimation is conducted using a local-linear ($p=1$)
    estimator with a local-quadratic ($q=2$) bias-correction estimate,
    with a triangular kernel. The standard error estimators are the ones
    proposed by CCT, computed using 3 nearest-neighbors.

2.  The bandwidth selection procedure is the one proposed by CCT,
    leading to $\hat{h}_{\mathtt{CCT},\nu,p}=16.7936$ with $p=1$, and
    $\hat{b}_{\mathtt{CCT},\nu,p,q}=27.4372$ with $q=2$. Recall
    $\hat{h}_{\mathtt{CCT},\nu,p}$ and $\hat{b}_{\mathtt{CCT},\nu,p,q}$
    are the estimated bandwidths used to construct the RD point
    estimator and the RD bias-correction, respectively, and $\nu=0$ in
    this illustration.

3.  The RD point estimator is
    $\hat\tau_p(\hat{h}_{\mathtt{CCT},\nu,p}) = 7.4253$ and the RD
    robust confidence intervals is
    $\hat{\mathsf{CI}}^{rbc}_{1-\alpha}(\hat{h}_{\mathtt{CCT},\nu,p},\hat{b}_{\mathtt{CCT},\nu,p,q}) = [\;4.0697\;,\;10.9833\;]$,
    with a default choice of $\alpha=0.05.$

The function `rdrobust()` also offers a more detailed output, which
includes all the point estimators, standard errors and confidence
intervals discussed previously. These results are retrieved using the
`all = TRUE` option. The corresponding output is as follows:

``` r
> rdrobust(y = vote, x = margin, all = TRUE)

Call:
rdrobust(y = vote, x = margin, all = TRUE)

```

Finally, we illustrate all the bandwidth selection procedures contained
in our package. To this end, we employ our companion function
`rdbwselect()` to compare the CCT bandwidth selectors with the IK and CV
approaches. We have:

``` r
> rdbwselect(y = vote, x = margin, all = TRUE)

Call:
rdbwselect(y = vote, x = margin, all = TRUE)

CV  35.42113       NA
```

In this case we employed the option `all = TRUE`, which computes the
three bandwidth selectors briefly discussed above. Notice that the
option `CV` is currently not available for derivative estimation. To
further understand the performance of the CV approach, we include a
graph of the CV objective function over the grid being considered. This
is done using the option `cvplot` as shown next (in this example we also
changed the grid features to obtain a better plot, and to show this
additional functionality in action as well).

``` r
> rdbwselect(y = vote, x = margin, bwselect = "CV", 
+   cvgrid_min = 10, cvgrid_max = 80, cvplot = TRUE)

Call:
rdbwselect(y = vote, x = margin, bwselect = "CV", cvgrid_min = 10, 
    cvgrid_max = 80, cvplot = TRUE)

![Figure 4: Values of the CV function over the selected
grid.](rdrobust_illustration-plot5.png){#fig:4 width="100%" alt="graphic without alt text"}

FigureÂ [4](#fig:4) shows the CV objective function as a function of a
grid of bandwidth. In this example, the cross validation approach
delivers a minimum at $\hat{h}_{\mathtt{CV},p}=34.5$.

Our functions contained in the R package *rdrobust* have many other
options. For instance, for the main function `rdrobust()` we have the
following additional examples (output is not provided to conserve
space).

-   Estimation using uniform kernel:\

# Conclusions {#section:conclusions}

We introduced the main features of the R package *rdrobust*, which
includes the functions `rdrobust()`, `rdbwselect()`, and `rdplot()`
designed to conduct data-driven nonparametric robust inference in RD
designs. This implementation covers average RD treatment effects at the
cutoff in the sharp RD, sharp kink RD, fuzzy RD and fuzzy kink RD
designs. A full description of this package may be found in its manual
and help files. A companion Stata package offering the same structure
and capabilities is described in @Calonico-Cattaneo-Titiunik_2014_Stata.
