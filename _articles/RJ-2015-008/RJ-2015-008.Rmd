title: 'showtext: Using System Fonts in R Graphics'
abstract: This article introduces the showtext package that makes it easy to use system
  fonts in R graphics. Unlike other methods to embed fonts into graphics, showtext
  converts text into raster images or polygons, and then adds them to the plot canvas.
  This method produces platform-independent image files that do not rely on the fonts
  that create them. It supports a large number of font formats and R graphics devices,
  and meanwhile provides convenient features such as using web fonts and integrating
  with knitr. This article provides an elaborate introduction to the showtext package,
  including its design, usage, and examples.
