title: 'StratigrapheR: Concepts for Litholog Generation in R '
abstract: ' The [StratigrapheR](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=StratigrapheR)
  package proposes new concepts for the generation of lithological logs, or lithologs,
  in R. The generation of lithologs in a scripting environment opens new opportunities
  for the processing and analysis of stratified geological data. Among the new concepts
  presented: new plotting and data processing methodologies, new general R functions,
  and computer-oriented data conventions are provided. The package structure allows
  for these new concepts to be further improved, which can be done independently by
  any R user. The current limitations of the package are highlighted, along with the
  limitations in R for geological data processing, to help identify the best paths
  for improvements. '
