title: Working with Daily Climate Model Output Data in R and the futureheatwaves Package
abstract: Research on climate change impacts can require extensive processing of climate
  model output, especially when using ensemble techniques to incorporate output from
  multiple climate models and multiple simulations of each model. This processing
  can be particularly extensive when identifying and characterizing multi-day extreme
  events like heat waves and frost day spells, as these must be processed from model
  output with daily time steps. Further, climate model output is in a format and follows
  standards that may be unfamiliar to most R users. Here, we provide an overview of
  working with daily climate model output data in R. We then present the futureheatwaves
  package, which we developed to ease the process of identifying, characterizing,
  and exploring multi-day extreme events in climate model output. This package can
  input a directory of climate model output files, identify all extreme events using
  customizable event definitions, and summarize the output using user-specified functions.
