title: Inference for Network Count Time Series with the R Package PNAR
abstract: We introduce a new R package useful for inference about network count time
  series. Such data are frequently encountered in statistics and they are usually
  treated as multivariate time series. Their statistical analysis is based on linear
  or log-linear models. Nonlinear models, which have been applied successfully in
  several research areas, have been neglected from such applications mainly because
  of their computational complexity. We provide R users the flexibility to fit and
  study nonlinear network count time series models which include either a drift in
  the intercept or a regime switching mechanism. We develop several computational
  tools including estimation of various count Network Autoregressive models and fast
  computational algorithms for testing linearity in standard cases and when non-identifiable
  parameters hamper the analysis. Finally, we introduce a copula Poisson algorithm
  for simulating multivariate network count time series. We illustrate the methodology
  by modeling weekly number of influenza cases in Germany.
