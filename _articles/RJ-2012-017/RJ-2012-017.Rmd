title: It's Not What You Draw,It's What You Don't Draw
abstract: 'The R graphics engine has new support for drawing complex paths via the
  functions polypath() and grid.path(). This article explains what is meant by a complex
  path and demonstrates the usefulness of complex paths in drawing non-trivial shapes,
  logos, customised data symbols, and maps. One of the design goals of the R graphics
  system is to allow fine control over the small details of plots. One way that the
  R graphics system does this is by providing access to low-level generic graphics
  facilities, such as the ability to draw basic shapes and the ability to control
  apparently esoteric, but still useful, features of those shapes, such as the line
  end style used for drawing lines. In R version 2.12.0, another low-level graphics
  facility was added to R: the ability to draw complex paths (not just polygons).
  This article describes this new facility and presents some examples that show how
  complex paths might be useful.'
