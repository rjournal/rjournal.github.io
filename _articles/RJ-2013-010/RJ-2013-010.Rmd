title: 'An Introduction to the EcoTroph R Package: Analyzing Aquatic Ecosystem Trophic
  Networks'
abstract: Recent advances in aquatic ecosystem modelling have particularly focused
  on trophic network analysis through trophodynamic models. We present here a R package
  devoted to a recently developed model, EcoTroph. This model enables the analysis
  of aquatic ecological networks and the related impacts of fisheries. It was available
  through a plug-in in the well-known Ecopath with Ecosim software or through implementations
  in Excel sheets. The R package we developed simplifies the access to the EcoTroph
  model and offers a new interfacing between two widely used software, Ecopath and
  R.
