title: 'dr4pl: A Stable Convergence Algorithm for the 4 Parameter Logistic Model'
abstract: The 4 Parameter Logistic (4PL) model has been recognized as a major tool
  to analyze the relationship between doses and responses in pharmacological experiments.
  A main strength of this model is that each parameter contributes an intuitive meaning
  enhancing interpretability of a fitted model. However, implementing the 4PL model
  using conventional statistical software often encounters numerical errors. This
  paper highlights the issue of convergence failure and presents several causes with
  solutions. These causes include outliers and a non-logistic data shape, so useful
  remedies such as robust estimation, outlier diagnostics and constrained optimization
  are proposed. These features are implemented in a new R package dr4pl (Dose-Response
  analysis using the 4 Parameter Logistic model) whose code examples are presented
  as a separate section. Our R package dr4pl is shown to work well for data sets where
  the traditional dose-response modelling packages drc and nplr fail.
