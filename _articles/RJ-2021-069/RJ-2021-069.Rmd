title: 'Estimating Social Influence Effects in Networks Using A Latent Space Adjusted
  Approach in R '
abstract: Social influence effects have been extensively studied in various empirical
  network research. However, many challenges remain in estimating social influence
  effects in networks, as influence effects are often entangled with other factors,
  such as homophily in the selection process and the common social-environmental factors
  that individuals are embedded in. Methods currently available either do not solve
  these problems or require stringent assumptions. Recent works by Xu (2018) and others
  have shown that a latent space adjusted approach based on the latent space model
  has the potential to disentangle the influence effects from other processes, and
  the simulation evidence has shown that this approach outperforms other state-of-the-art
  approaches in terms of recovering the true social influence effect when there is
  an unobserved trait co-determining influence and selection. In this paper, I will
  further illustrate how the latent space adjusted approach can account for bias in
  the estimation of social influence effects and how this approach can be easily implemented
  in R.
