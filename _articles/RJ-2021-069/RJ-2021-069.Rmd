title: Estimating Social Influence Effects in Networks Using A Latent Space Adjusted
  Approach in R
abstract: Social influence effects have been extensively studied in various empirical
  network research. However, many challenges remain in estimating social influence
  effects in networks, as influence effects are often entangled with other factors,
  such as homophily in the selection process and the common social-environmental factors
  that individuals are embedded in. Methods currently available either do not solve
  these problems or require stringent assumptions. Recent works by Xu (2018) and others
  have shown that a latent space adjusted approach based on the latent space model
  has the potential to disentangle the influence effects from other processes, and
  the simulation evidence has shown that this approach outperforms other state-of-the-art
  approaches in terms of recovering the true social influence effect when there is
  an unobserved trait co-determining influence and selection. In this paper, I will
  further illustrate how the latent space adjusted approach can account for bias in
  the estimation of social influence effects and how this approach can be easily implemented
  in R.

# Introduction

Social influence effects, sometimes referred to as spillover or
contagion effects, have long been central to the field of social science
[@asch:1972; @erbring:1979; @Bandura:1986]. It is defined as the
propensity for the behavior of an individual to vary along with the
prevalence of that behavior in some reference group [@manski_1993], such
as one's social contacts. With the availability of social network data,
social influence effects have received much attention and have been
widely used to study various phenomena such as the spread of health
behavior (e.g., obesity and smoking)
[@christakis_2007; @christakis_2008], psychological states
[@cacioppo_2008; @german_2012], professional practices [@frank_2004] and
information diffusion [@valente_1995; @valente_1996].

However, many challenges remain in estimating social influence effects,
especially from observational network data, because it is difficult to
separate the effect of social influences from other processes that
operate simultaneously. That is, when we observe that people in close
relationships or interactions tend to be similar in their behaviors or
states, it is difficult to identify the underlying mechanisms that
generate these patterns. One mechanism could be influence or contagion
[@friedkin_1999; @friedkin_2001; @oetting_1998], whereby individuals
assimilate the behavior of their network partners. Another mechanism
could be selection -- in particular, homophily
[@mcpherson_1987; @mcpherson_2001], in which individuals seek to
interact with similar others. Furthermore, there could be some common
social-environmental factors -- individuals with previous similarities
select themselves into the same social settings (e.g., hospital or
alcoholics anonymous (AA) support group), and actual network formation
just reflects the opportunities of meeting in this social setting
[@feld_1981; @feld_1982; @kalmijn_flap_2001][^1].

Entanglement among these different mechanisms unavoidably induces bias
when we estimate social influence effects [@shalizi_thomas_2011].
Various statistical methods and recent advancements in the field of
social network analysis have attempted to reduce the bias in estimating
social influence effects, such as instrumental variable (IV) methods
[@bramou:2009], propensity score methods [@Aral:2009], and stochastic
actor-oriented models (SAOM) [@snijders_2010]. Although each potentially
leverages extra information in the data to reduce bias, none can claim
to eliminate all sources of bias.

Recent works by @xu_2018 and others [@shalizi_2018] have shown that a
latent space adjusted approach based on the latent space model
[@hoff_2002] has the potential to disentangle the social influence
effects from other processes operating at the same time, and simulation
evidence has shown that this approach outperforms some other
state-of-the-art methods (e.g., instrumental variable method, structural
equation model) in terms of recovering the true social influence
effects. In this paper, I will illustrate how the latent space adjusted
approach can account for bias in the estimation of social influence
effects and demonstrate how it can be easily incorporated with various
models in R to estimate social influence effects. In the following
sections, I will first explain the challenges in estimating social
influence effects and how they can be framed as an omitted variable bias
problem. Then I will formally introduce the latent space adjusted
approach and explain how it can account for bias in the estimation of
social influence effects. Finally, I will demonstrate how this approach
can be easily implemented in R and how it can be incorporated with
various models to estimate social influence effects, including a dynamic
linear-in-mean influence model and a stochastic actor-oriented model
(SAOM).

# Identification of Social Influence as An Omitted Variable Bias Problem

Similarities of behavior, state, and characteristics of two individuals
in a network relationship can be caused by three primary mechanisms:
influence, homophilous selection, or common social-environmental factors
[@vanderweele_an_2013]. While it is possible to rule out some mechanisms
through random treatment assignment or networks in experiments,
entanglement among these different mechanisms makes it difficult to
correctly estimate social influence effects from observational data
[@xu_2020]. The challenges in estimation caused by entanglement among
social influence effects and common social-environmental factors can be
easily framed as an omitted variable bias problem (e.g., ignoring the
group or environment individuals belong to when estimating the social
influence model). What is less obvious is that entanglement between the
influence and the homophilous selection can also be framed as an omitted
variable bias problem. As pointed out by @steglich_2010, one of the
important concerns of SAOM is the \"possibility that there may be
non-observed variables co-determining the probabilities of change in
network and/or behavior\". @shalizi_thomas_2011 have shown that when
there is an unobserved trait that co-determines both behavior and
network choice, social influence effects are generally unidentifiable as
social influence and homophily (selection) are generically confounded
through this unobserved trait.

To give an example, assuming that adolescent $i$'s alcohol use at time
$t$, $alcohol_{it}$, is the outcome of interest, and it is a function of
his/her previous alcohol use, $alcohol_{it-1}$, his/her friend $j$'s
previous alcohol use, $alcohol_{jt-1}$ (i.e., social influence), and an
unobserved tendency for substance-abuse (arrow D in Figure
[1](#figure:rlogo)). At the same time, there is a homophilous selection
based on this unobserved substance-abuse tendency in the network --
individuals with similar levels of substance-abuse tendency are more
likely to be friends (arrow A in Figure [1](#figure:rlogo)). As a
result, person $j$'s alcohol use, which is a function of person $j$'s
substance-abuse tendency (arrow $B_{j}$), will be correlated with person
$i$'s substance-abuse tendency through homophilous selection (arrow C in
Figure [1](#figure:rlogo)). However, as the substance-abuse tendency is
unobserved, this violates the key assumption of most estimation methods
(i.e., the omitted variable should not correlate with the independent
variables) such that the estimates of the social influence effects will
be biased and inconsistent.

# Latent Space Adjusted Approach

@xu_2018 recently proposed a latent space adjusted approach, and
simulation evidence has shown that it has the potential to correctly
identify social influence effects when there is an unobserved variable
that co-determines the influence and the selection process.
Specifically, the behavioral (influence) model can be represented as

$$Y_{i} = f(Z_{ij},Y_j,X_i,c_i)$$

where the behavior of person $i$, $Y_{i}$, is a function of the
behaviors of his/her network partners $j$, $Y_j$, the network relations
between $i$ and $j$, $Z_{ij}$, person $i$'s observed characteristics
$X_i$ as well as a time-invariant unobserved trait $c_i$.[^2] For
example, adolescent $i$'s alcohol use at time $t$, $Y_{it}$, can be a
function of his/her previous alcohol use, $Y_{it-1}$, his/her close
friends' previous alcohol use $Y_{jt-1}$, his/her own cigarette use,
$X_{it}$, and a time-invariant unobserved tendency for substance abuse
$c_i$.

The selection model can be represented as

$$P(Z_{ij}=1)=g(X_{ij},D(c_i,c_j))$$

where the probability that person $i$ and person $j$ has a network
relation is a function of the individual and dyadic level observed
variables $X_{ij}$, and a distance function of the unobserved trait $c$
between $i$ and $j$, such that $i$ and $j$ are more likely to have a
network relation when they are close to each other in terms of $c$. For
example, the probability that adolescent $i$ and $j$ are friends at time
$t$ $Z_{ijt}$ can be a function of the absolute value of the differences
between their cigarette use at time t $|X_{it}-X_{jt}|$ (observed
homophily) and the absolute value of the differences between their
unobserved tendencies for substance abuse $|c_i-c_j|$ (latent
homophily), where i and j are more likely to become friends when they
are similar to each other in terms of the cigarette use (X) or the
tendency for substance abuse (c).

Ideally, if there is any information about this unobserved trait $c$
from the selection process in (2), it can be leveraged and used in the
estimation of the behavioral model in (1), and in principle this will
reduce the bias when estimating the social influence effects. However,
the estimations of most selection models are based on the observed
variables and thus do not attend to those factors that are unobserved.
@xu_2018 extended this idea and built on the theoretical logic of latent
space models [@hoff_2002]. Latent space models assume that each
individual has a \"latent position\" that lies in an unobserved
n-dimensional social space, and the probability of interaction between
any two actors depends on the latent positions of these two actors.
Specifically, the model takes a logistic form and can be specified as

$$logodds(Z_{ij}=1 \| c_i,c_j,x_{ij},\alpha,\beta)=\alpha+\beta'x_{ij}-|c_i-c_j|$$

Here, $Z_{ij}$ indicates whether there is a network relation from $i$ to
$j$, $x_{ij}$ is a vector of the observed covariates (at the dyadic
level or node level), $c$ indicates the latent social position of $i$
and $j$, and $|c_i-c_j|$ represents the Euclidean distance between $i$
and $j$'s latent positions (it could also be replaced by other distance
functions). When $i$ and $j$ are closer to each other in terms of the
latent position $c$, they will have a higher probability of having a
network relation. And these latent positions can represent determinants
of the network relations that have not been accounted for by the
observed variables in the selection process. The parameters $\alpha$ and
$\beta$ are estimated using either Maximum-Likelihood Estimation (MLE)
or Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods, and the latent positions $c$
can be estimated by Minimum Kullback-Leibler (MKL) estimates
[@shortreed_2006].

It is not difficult to see that the latent space model in (3) is very
similar to the selection process in (2), except that $c$ represents the
latent position in the latent space model, while $c$ represents the
individual's unobserved trait in (2).[^3] For any pair of $i$ and $j$, a
smaller distance between the latent social positions or the unobserved
traits will result in a higher likelihood of having network relations.
Therefore, when two individuals are close to each other in terms of the
unobserved traits, they are more likely to have a network relation, and
they should also be close to each other in terms of the latent positions
(and vice versa).

Furthermore, if these latent positions from the latent space model are
estimated accurately enough, the estimates of these latent positions can
be used as the proxies for the unobserved traits that determine the
homophily in the selection process. In fact, for two one dimensional
variables X and Y, if the distance correlation (e.g., correlation
between $|X_i-X_j|$ and $|Y_i-Y_j|$) is 1, then Y can be written as a
linear function of X: $Y=a+bX$ [@szekely_2007], which means the
correlation between the two variables are either 1 or -1. **Thus, the
estimated latent positions from the latent space model can be used as
the proxies [@wooldridge_2011] for the unobserved traits that
co-determine influence and selection, and including the latent positions
as additional covariates in the behavioral model will reduce the bias in
the estimation of social influence effects**. For example, to model
adolescents' social influences on their alcohol use, we can first use a
latent space model to model the friendship network of adolescents and
acquire the estimated \"latent positions\" for each individual, and then
use these estimates as the proxies for the unobserved substance-abuse
tendencies in the behavioral model, and thus achieve a better estimation
of the true social influence effects. If the social network data is
longitudinal, estimated latent positions from each time point can be
included as separate covariates in the behavioral model to better
approximate the unobserved trait.

@shalizi_2018 have shown that if the network grows according to a
continuous latent space model, the latent positions can be consistently
estimated. Controlling for these latent positions allows for unbiased
and consistent estimation of the social-influence effects in additive
influence models. Simulation evidence from @xu_2018 has shown that when
there is a time-invariant unobserved variable that co-determines
selection and influence, the estimated latent positions can be good
proxies for the unobserved variable, and the latent space adjusted
approach outperforms other methods that are commonly used to deal with
the unobserved variables, including a structural equation based
estimator (implemented using
[*lavaan*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=lavaan) package in R
[@rosseel_2019]) and an instrumental variable estimator (implemented
using [*plm*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=plm) package in R
[@croissant_2008]), in producing the smallest bias and standard error of
the social influence effect using a dynamic linear-in-mean influence
model. The results are robust to the inclusion of additional covariates,
structural properties (e.g., transitivity) in networks, different
scaling of the latent space model, or even misspecifications [@xu_2018].

Finally, there are a couple of things to note: (1) for the estimated
latent positions to better approximate the unobserved traits, we need to
control for other mechanisms that are likely to drive the selection
process in the latent space model, such as homophily based on the
observed variables, transitivity, alter, and ego effects. (2) In
principle this method can apply to any functional form of the
behavioral/influence model (e.g., stochastic actor-oriented models), as
essentially this approach just adds additional covariates as the proxies
for the unobserved traits. (3) As the scales and the actual positions of
the estimated latent positions are essentially arbitrary [@hoff_2002],
the actual values of the latent positions might be very different from
the actual values of the unobserved traits that co-determine influence
and selection. However, as long as the estimated latent positions are
highly correlated with the unobserved traits (i.e., actors who are close
to each other on the latent positions are also close to each other in
terms of the unobserved traits), the social influence effects can still
be consistently estimated. (4) This approach works in scenarios where
there are unobserved traits that co-determine influence and selection
(homophily).[^4] It does not improve the estimation of social influence
effects when the unobserved traits are only present in one process but
not the other.

# An Empirical Example in R

In this section, I present an empirical example illustrating how to
implement the latent space adjusted approach to estimate the social
influence effect using R 3.5.2. The data comes from the social network
data collected in the Teenage Friends and Lifestyle Study data set
[@michell_2000; @pearson_2003]. Friendship network data and substance
use were recorded for a cohort of 50 female pupils in a school in the
West of Scotland. The panel data were recorded over three years,
starting in 1995, when the pupils were aged 13, and ending in 1997. The
friendship networks were formed by allowing the pupils to name up to
twelve best friends. Pupils were also asked about substance use and
adolescent behavior associated with, for instance, lifestyle, sporting
behavior, tobacco, alcohol, and cannabis consumption. The question on
sporting activity asked if the pupil regularly took part in any sport,
or went training for sport, out of school (e.g., football, gymnastics,
skating, mountain biking). The school was representative of others in
the region in terms of social class composition [@pearson_2003]. The key
variables used in this example were measured three times from 1995-1997
and included pupils' friendship networks (binary variable representing
each possible directed pair, 1 if nominated and 0 otherwise), smoking
(measured on a 1-3 scale), drug use (measured on a 1-4 scale), alcohol
use (measured on a 1-5 scale) and sport activity (measured on a 1-2
scale). The dataset is available
[here](https://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/~snijders/siena/s50_data.htm).

First, I install and load all the packages needed in R.
[*latentnet*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=latentnet) is the
package that is used to estimate the latent space model
[@krivitsky_2008]. And
[*statnet*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=statnet) is the package
to manipulate and create the network object [@handcock_2008].

``` r
> library(latentnet)
> library(RSiena)
> library(sna)
> library(statnet)
```

The network data comes with the
[*RSiena*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=RSiena) package
[@rsiena_2018]. I load the attribute data into the current session and
create network objects over 3 time points:

``` r
##Load girls' attributes on smoking, drug use, sport and alcohol use 
> s50s<-read.table("s50-smoke.dat",header=FALSE)
> s50d<-read.table("s50-drugs.dat",header=FALSE)
> s50sp<-read.table("s50-sport.dat",header=FALSE) 
> s50a<-read.table("s50-alcohol.dat", header=FALSE)

## Create network object with attributes for each time point
> g1<-network(s501,directed=TRUE)
> g1%v%"a" <- s50a[,1]
> g1%v%"s" <- s50s[,1]
> g1%v%"sp" <- s50sp[,1]
> g1%v%"d" <- s50d[,1]

> g2<-network(s502,directed=TRUE)
> g2%v%"a" <- s50a[,2]
> g2%v%"s" <- s50s[,2]
> g2%v%"sp" <- s50sp[,2]
> g2%v%"d" <- s50d[,2]

> g3<-network(s503,directed=TRUE)
> g3%v%"a" <- s50a[,3]
> g3%v%"s" <- s50s[,3]
> g3%v%"sp" <- s50sp[,3]
> g3%v%"d" <- s50d[,3]
```

We can plot each network and observe how they have changed over time.
Figure [2](#figure:network) shows how these girls' friendship networks
have changed from 1995 to 1997. The network graphs show that there have
been considerable network changes over time, and distinct
components/clusters have emerged over time.

![Figure 2: Girls' friendship network from 1995 to
1997.](fig-2.png){#figure:network width="100%"
alt="graphic without alt text"}

My primary research question is whether these girls influence each
other's alcohol use. Here I demonstrate how to estimate the social
influence effect by incorporating the latent space adjusted approach
with a dynamic linear-in-mean model [@friedkin_johnsen_1990] using the
`"lm"` function and a stochastic actor-oriented model using *RSiena*
package [@snijders_2010; @rsiena_2018] in R. I start by estimating the
latent space models using the `"ergmm"` function to extract the
estimated latent positions. Specifically, I estimate two latent space
models based on networks in 1995 and 1996 with one dimensional latent
space, while controlling for homophily based on observed variables such
as alcohol, smoking, drug use and sport:

``` r
> m1<-ergmm(g1 ~ euclidean(d = 1)+absdiff("a")+absdiff("s")+absdiff("sp")+absdiff("d"),
+ control=ergmm.control(sample.size=5000,burnin=20000,interval=10,Z.delta=5))
> m2<-ergmm(g2 ~ euclidean(d = 1)+absdiff("a")+absdiff("s")+absdiff("sp")+absdiff("d"),
+ control=ergmm.control(sample.size=5000,burnin=20000,interval=10,Z.delta=5))
```

Once the latent space models are estimated, I can extract the latent
positions and add them as additional covariates when estimating the
behavioral/influence model. First I estimate a dynamic linear-in-mean
influence model, which can be represented as [@friedkin_johnsen_1990]:

$$Y_{it}=\beta_{0}+\beta_{1}Y_{it-1}+\beta_{2}\frac{\sum Z_{ijt-1}Y_{jt-1}}{\sum Z_{ijt-1} }+\beta_{3}X_{it}+e_{it},$$

where $Y_{it}$ is the behavior of $i$ at time $t$, $Y_{it-1}$ is the
previous behavior of $i$, $Z_{ijt-1}$ is a dummy variable indicating if
there is a link from $i$ to $j$ at time $t-1$, i.e., 1 if yes and 0
otherwise, and $\frac{\sum Z_{ijt-1}Y_{jt-1}}{\sum Z_{ijt-1} }$ is the
average behaviors at time $t-1$ among the network neighbors of $i$, and
$\beta_{2}$ represents the social influence effect. $X_{it}$ represents
other concurrent variables of $i$ that might affect the behavioral
outcome Y. To estimate the dynamic linear-in-mean influence model, I
first need to construct the dataset used by this model:

``` r
## create the average alcohol use of each person's friends
> E<-matrix(0,50,3)
for (i in 1:50)
{
if (sum(s501[i,])!=0)
E[i,1]<-(s501[i,]%*%s50a[,1])/sum(s501[i,])
if (sum(s502[i,])!=0)
E[i,2]<-(s502[i,]%*%s50a[,2])/sum(s502[i,])
if (sum(s503[i,])!=0)
E[i,3]<-(s503[i,]%*%s50a[,3])/sum(s503[i,])
}

## create the dataset to estimate the dynamic linear-in-mean influence model

> lag_alc<-c(s50a[,2],s50a[,1])
> expo<-c(E[,2],E[,1])

```

We can also look at the correlations between the estimated latent
positions and the observed variables:

``` r
> cor(infl[,1:8])


            alcohol  lag_alc   expo   drug  smoke   sport  latent_pos1  latent_pos2

```

From the correlation table, strong network autocorrelations are observed
-- one's alcohol use `alcohol`, previous alcohol use `lag_alc`, and
friends' alcohol use expo are all highly correlated with each other.
Furthermore, the estimated latent positions in 1995 and 1996
`latent_pos1` and `latent_pos2` have sizable correlations with both
girls' alcohol use and their friends' alcohol use. As the calculations
of the latent positions are already conditioned on homophily based on
the observed variables such as alcohol, drug, smoking, and sport, the
results suggest that there might be some unobserved variables (e.g., an
unobserved tendency for substance abuse) that drive both girls' alcohol
use and choice of friends.

To estimate the dynamic linear-in-mean influence model, I first estimate
an influence model with the latent positions as the additional
covariates and then estimate another model without the latent positions:

``` r
> summary(lm(alcohol~lag_alc+expo+smoke+sport+drug+latent_pos1+latent_pos2,data=infl))

Call:
lm(formula = alcohol ~ lag_alc + expo + smoke + sport + drug +

Results show that if I only include previous alcohol use and other
observed covariates, the social influence effect on alcohol use is
significant (coef=.152, se=.075, p=.045) -- that is, if these girls'
friends use more alcohol, they will also use more alcohol. However, when
I include the latent positions as the additional covariates in the
model, the social influence effect (coef=.129, se=.083, p=.126) is no
longer significant.[^5] These results suggest that there are likely to
be unobserved variables that drive both girls' alcohol use and choice of
friends (e.g. unobserved substance-abuse tendency), and ignoring them
will lead to  18% overestimation of the social influence effect in this
case, which can lead to erroneous statistical inferences.

Next, I estimate a Stochastic Actor-Oriented Model (SAOM) using *RSiena*
to test if there is any social influence effect on girls' alcohol use.
SAOM is a class of simulation-based statistical models that can model
behavioral and network change simultaneously. In the simulation process,
SAOM assumes the underlying time is continuous and that actors control
their behavior and outgoing ties. At a given moment, one
probabilistically selected actor has the opportunity to change one
outgoing tie or small step in his or her behavior. The change follows a
Markov process in which small changes in networks and behavior are
accumulated in each micro-step, and large differences can then be
observed between initial and final networks [@snijders_2010]. For
statistical inference, the parameter values of the simulation algorithms
are selected such that the simulated and observed data resemble each
other most closely, and the parameters can be estimated by matching key
statistics of the simulated and observed networks via the method of
moments, generalized method of moments, or likelihood-based methods
[@steglich_2010]. SAOM is appealing as it intuitively incorporates both
the influence and network-selection process from an individual-level
perspective, such that the network-selection effects are adjusted for in
the estimation of influence effects. However, estimates from SAOMs are
still likely to be biased when unobserved variables are co-determining
the probabilities of change in network and/or behavior [@steglich_2010]
and thus may benefit from the latent space adjusted approach in these
scenarios.

I start by constructing a dataset that can be used by SAOM models for
estimation:

``` r
## create data structure that can be used to estimate SAOM
> friend.data.w1 <- s501
> friend.data.w2 <- s502
> friend.data.w3 <- s503
> drink <- s50a
> smoke <- s50s
> drug  <- s50d
> sport <- s50sp
> friendship <- sienaDependent( array( c( friend.data.w1, friend.data.w2,
+                                         friend.data.w3 ),
+                                 dim = c( 50, 50, 3 ) ) 
> drinkingbeh <- sienaDependent( drink, type = "behavior" )
> smokingbeh <- varCovar( as.matrix(smoke))
> drugbeh <- varCovar( as.matrix(drug))
> sportbeh <- varCovar( as.matrix(sport))
> lat1<-coCovar(as.vector(m1$mkl$Z)) ## latent position from 1995
> lat2<-coCovar(as.vector(m2$mkl$Z)) ## latent position from 1996
> myCoEvolutionData <- sienaDataCreate( friendship, drinkingbeh,
+                      smokingbeh,drugbeh,sportbeh,lat1,lat2 )
```

To specify the SAOM model, the following codes can be used.
Specifically, in the selection part of the model, I include structural
effects such as reciprocity, transitivity, popularity, geometrically
weighted degree, and homophily based on alcohol, drug use, smoking,
sport, and the latent positions. In the behavioral part of the model, I
model girls' alcohol use as a function of the linear and quadratic
shapes, average similarity effect (i.e., social influence effect), the
observed covariates such as drug use, smoking, sport, as well as the
latent positions as the additional covariates:

Results show that there is strong homophily based on the latent
positions in the selection process. Furthermore, the estimate for
average similarity (i.e., social influence effect) effect is 3.03, and
the standard error is 2.27. Next, I compare it with a SAOM model that
excludes the latent positions in both selection and behavioral models.

The estimate for the social influence effect is now 4.07, with a
standard error of 2.10. As a result, ignoring the latent position will
likely lead to 34% overestimation of the social influence effect in this
case using the SAOM models.

# Discussion and Conclusion

Social influence effects are generally difficult to identify, as
influence processes are often entangled with other processes such as
selection and social-environmental factors. Here I have shown that this
entanglement/difficulty can essentially be framed as an omitted variable
bias problem, and a latent space adjusted approach holds promise to
correctly identify social influence effects in this case. And I have
demonstrated how to use the latent space adjusted approach to estimate
various social influence models with existing packages in R. Results
show that models that ignore the unobserved variables that drive both
influence and selection are likely to overestimate the true social
influence effect, while the latent space adjusted approach holds promise
to correct that bias and serves as a more conservative test of the true
social influence effect.

Although the latent space adjusted approach proposed in this paper is
flexible enough to be incorporated with any functional form of the
behavioral/influence model, and holds much promise as an alternative
approach to identify the social influence effect, several limitations
also come with this approach: (1) As previously mentioned, the latent
space adjusted approach requires that the same unobserved traits occur
in both the influence and the selection process. It can not account for
the unobserved traits that are only present in one of the processes but
not the other. (2) The choice of the dimensions for the latent positions
in the latent space model is not clear. Although I have chosen
one-dimensional latent positions in all of the simulations and empirical
examples, this does not need to be the case and there is no clear rule
deciding how many dimensions users should use. (3) The computation of
latent positions is very time-consuming, and the computation time
increases significantly with the increase of data or the number of
dimensions of the latent positions.

Nevertheless, the latent space adjusted approach proposed here provides
a useful and more plausible estimate of the true social influence
effect, especially when the entanglement between influence and selection
is of concern. This paper contributes to the literature by further
illustrating how the latent space adjusted approach may account for bias
in the estimation of the social influence effect, as well as how this
approach can be easily implemented in R.
:::

[^1]: There are also structural constraints such as transitivity and
    preferential attachment which could cause people to become friends.
    However, these mechanisms in themselves do not entangle with
    influence (e.g., one can befriend another having high popularity but
    different behavior). In these cases, another mechanism must be
    present to induce similarities between these friends (e.g.,
    selection of common friends based on similarity in attributes), and
    thus the entanglement goes back to the original three mechanisms,
    namely influence, selection based on homophily, and
    social-environmental factors.

[^2]: Here Y, X, Z are assumed to be time-variant and $c$ is assumed to
    be time-invariant, but the assumption can be relaxed.

[^3]: Here I only choose one-dimensional latent social positions to
    mimic the unobserved trait that drives the homophily in the
    selection process. The arguments can easily be extended to
    multi-dimensional latent positions.

[^4]: In principle this approach could also account for unobserved
    social-environmental factors that drive influence and selection.

[^5]: Latent space model uses a MCMC estimation and thus the results
    will be slightly different each time. It is suggested to estimate
    latent space model with longer burn-in, larger sample size, and over
    multiple times to acquire the final estimates (e.g., using mean or
    mode of the estimates).
