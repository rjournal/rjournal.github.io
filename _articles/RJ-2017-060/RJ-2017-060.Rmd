title: 'ManlyMix: An R Package for Manly Mixture Modeling'
abstract: Model-based clustering is a popular technique for grouping objects based
  on a finite mixture model. It has countless applications in different fields of
  study. The R package ManlyMix implements the Manly mixture model that allows modeling
  skewness within data groups and performs cluster analysis. ManlyMix is a powerful
  diagnostics tool that is capable of conducting investigation con cerning the normality
  of variables upon fitting of a Manly forward or backward model. Theoretical foundations
  as well as description of functions are provided. All features of the package are
  illus trated with examples in great detail. The analysis of real-life datasets demonstrates
  the flexibility and usefulness of the package.
