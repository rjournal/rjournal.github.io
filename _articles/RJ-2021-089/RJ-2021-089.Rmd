title: Robust and Efficient Optimization Using a Marquardt-Levenberg Algorithm with
  R Package marqLevAlg
abstract: 'Implementations in R of classical general-purpose algorithms for local
  optimization generally have two major limitations which cause difficulties in applications
  to complex problems: too loose convergence criteria and too long calculation time.
  By relying on a Marquardt-Levenberg algorithm (MLA), a Newton-like method particularly
  robust for solving local optimization problems, we provide with marqLevAlg package
  an efficient and general-purpose local optimizer which (i) prevents con vergence
  to saddle points by using a stringent convergence criterion based on the relative
  distance to minimum/maximum in addition to the stability of the parameters and of
  the objective function; and (ii) reduces the computation time in complex settings
  by allowing parallel calculations at each iteration. We demonstrate through a variety
  of cases from the literature that our implementation reli ably and consistently
  reaches the optimum (even when other optimizers fail) and also largely reduces computational
  time in complex settings through the example of maximum likelihood estimation of
  different sophisticated statistical models.'
