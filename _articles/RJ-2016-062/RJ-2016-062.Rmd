title: 'mctest: An R Package for Detection of Collinearity among Regressors'
abstract: 'It is common for linear regression models to be plagued with the problem
  of multicollinearity when two or more regressors are highly correlated. This problem
  results in unstable estimates of regression coefficients and causes some serious
  problems in validation and interpretation of the model. Different diagnostic measures
  are used to detect multicollinearity among regressors. Many statistical software
  and R packages provide few diagnostic measures for the judgment of multicollinearity.
  Most widely used diagnostic measures in these software are: coefficient of determination
  (R2 ), variance inflation factor/tolerance limit (VIF/TOL), eigenvalues, condition
  number (CN) and condition index (CI) etc. In this manuscript, we present an R package,
  mctest, that computes popular and widely used multicollinearity diagnostic measures.
  The package also indicates which regressors may be the reason of collinearity among
  regressors.'
