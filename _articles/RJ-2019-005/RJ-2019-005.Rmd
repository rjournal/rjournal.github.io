title: 'rollmatch: An R Package for Rolling Entry Matching'
abstract: The gold standard of experimental research is the randomized control trial.
  However, interventions are often implemented without a randomized control group
  for practical or ethical reasons. Propensity score matching (PSM) is a popular method
  for minimizing the effects of a randomized experiment from observational data by
  matching members of a treatment group to similar candidates that did not receive
  the intervention. Traditional PSM is not designed for studies that enroll participants
  on a rolling basis and does not provide a solution for interventions in which the
  baseline and intervention period are undefined in the comparison group. Rolling
  Entry Matching (REM) is a new matching method that addresses both issues. REM selects
  comparison members who are similar to intervention members with respect to both
  static (e.g., race) and dynamic (e.g., health conditions) characteristics. This
  paper will discuss the key components of REM and introduce the rollmatch R package.
