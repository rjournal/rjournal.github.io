title: openSkies - Integration of Aviation Data into the R Ecosystem
abstract: Aviation data has become increasingly more accessible to the public thanks
  to the adoption of technologies such as Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast
  (ADS-B) and Mode S, which provide aircraft information over publicly accessible
  radio channels. Furthermore, the OpenSky Network provides multiple public resources
  to access such air traffic data from a large network of ADS-B receivers. Here, we
  present openSkies, the first R package for processing public air traffic data. The
  package provides an interface to the OpenSky Network resources, standardized data
  structures to represent the different entities involved in air traffic data, and
  functionalities to analyze and visualize such data. Furthermore, the portability
  of the implemented data structures makes openSkies easily reusable by other packages,
  therefore laying the foundation of aviation data engineering in R.
