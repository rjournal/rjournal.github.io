title: 'spikeslab: Prediction and Variable Selection Using Spike and Slab Regression'
abstract: Weighted generalized ridge regression offers unique advantages in correlated
  high-dimensional problems. Such estimators can be efficiently computed using Bayesian
  spike and slab models and are effective for prediction. For sparse variable selection,
  a generalization of the elastic net can be used in tandem with these Bayesian estimates.
  In this article, we describe the R-software package spikeslab for implementing this
  new spike and slab prediction and variable selection methodology.
