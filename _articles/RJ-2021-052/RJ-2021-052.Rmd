title: Towards a Grammar for Processing Clinical Trial Data
abstract: The goal of this paper is to help define a path toward a grammar for processing
  clinical trials by a) defining a format in which we would like to represent data
  from standardized clinical trial data b) describing a standard set of operations
  to transform clinical trial data into this format, and c) to identify a set of verbs
  and other functionality to facilitate data processing and encourage reproducibility
  in the processing of these data. It provides a background on standard clinical trial
  data and goes through a simple preprocessing example illustrating the value of the
  proposed approach through the use of the forceps package, which is currently being
  used for data of this kind.
