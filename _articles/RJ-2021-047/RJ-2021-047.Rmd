title: 'Working with CRSP/COMPUSTAT in R: Reproducible Empirical Asset Pricing'
abstract: It is common to come across SAS or Stata manuals while working on academic
  empirical finance research. Nonetheless, given the popularity of open-source programming
  languages such as R, there are fewer resources in R covering popular databases such
  as CRSP and COMPUSTAT. The aim of this article is to bridge the gap and illustrate
  how to leverage R in working with both datasets. As an application, we illustrate
  how to form size-value portfolios with respect to [@fama1993common] and study the
  sensitivity of the results with respect to different inputs. Ultimately, the purpose
  of the article is to advocate reproducible finance research and contribute to the
  recent idea of "Open Source Cross-Sectional Asset Pricing", proposed by @chen2020open.
