title: SARIMA Analysis and Automated Model Reports with BETS, an R Package
abstract: 'This article aims to demonstrate how the powerful features of the R package
  BETS can be applied to SARIMA time series analysis. BETS provides not only thousands
  of Brazilian economic time series from different institutions, but also a range
  of analytical tools, and educational resources. In particular, BETS is capable of
  generating automated model reports for any given time series. These reports rely
  on a single function call and are able to build three types of models (SARIMA being
  one of them). The functions need few inputs and output rich content. The output
  varies according to the inputs and usually consists of a summary of the series properties,
  step-by-step explanations on how the model was developed, predictions made by the
  model, and a file containing these predictions. This work focuses on this feature
  and several other BETS functions that are designed to help in modeling time series.
  We present them in a thorough case study: the SARIMA approach to model and forecast
  the Brazilian production of intermediate goods index series.'
