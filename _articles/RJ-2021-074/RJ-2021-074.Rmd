title: 'MAINT.Data: Modelling and Analysing Interval Data in R'
abstract: We present the CRAN R package MAINT.Data for the modelling and analysis
  of multivariate interval data, i.e., where units are described by variables whose
  values are intervals of IR, representing intrinsic variability. Parametric inference
  methodologies based on probabilistic models for interval variables have been developed,
  where each interval is represented by its midpoint and log-range, for
