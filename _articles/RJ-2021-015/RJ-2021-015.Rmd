title: 'Kuhn-Tucker and Multiple Discrete-Continuous Extreme Value Model Estimation
  and Simulation in R: The rmdcev Package'
abstract: This paper introduces the package rmdcev in R for estimation and simulation
  of Kuhn-Tucker demand models with individual heterogeneity. The models supported
  by rmdcev are the multiple-discrete continuous extreme value (MDCEV) model and Kuhn-Tucker
  specification common in the environmental economics literature on recreation demand.
  Latent class and random parameters specifications can be implemented and the models
  are fit using maximum likelihood estimation or Bayesian estimation. The rmdcev package
  also implements demand forecasting and welfare calculation for policy simulation.
  The purpose of this paper is to describe the model estimation and simulation framework
  and to demonstrate the functionalities of rmdcev using real datasets.
