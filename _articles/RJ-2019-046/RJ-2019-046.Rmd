title: 'PPCI: an R Package for Cluster Identification using Projection Pursuit'
abstract: This paper presents the R package PPCI which implements three recently proposed
  projec tion pursuit methods for clustering. The methods are unified by the approach
  of defining an optimal hyperplane to separate clusters, and deriving a projection
  index whose optimiser is the vector normal to this separating hyperplane. Divisive
  hierarchical clustering algorithms that can detect clusters defined in different
  subspaces are readily obtained by recursively bi-partitioning the data through such
  hyperplanes. Projecting onto the vector normal to the optimal hyperplane enables
  visualisations of the data that can be used to validate the partition at each level
  of the cluster hierarchy. Clustering models can also be modified in an interactive
  manner to improve their solutions. Extensions to problems involving clusters which
  are not linearly separable, and to the problem of finding maximum hard margin hyperplanes
  for clustering are also discussed.
