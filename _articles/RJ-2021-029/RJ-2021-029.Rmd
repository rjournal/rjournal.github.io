title: Wide-to-tall Data Reshaping Using Regular Expressions and the nc Package
abstract: Regular expressions are powerful tools for extracting tables from non-tabular
  text data. Capturing regular expressions that describe the information to extract
  from column names can be especially useful when reshaping a data table from wide
  (few rows with many regularly named columns) to tall (fewer columns with more rows).
  We present the R package nc (short for named capture), which provides functions
  for wide-to-tall data reshaping using regular expressions. We describe the main
  new ideas of nc, and provide detailed comparisons with related R packages (stats,
  utils, data.table, tidyr, tidyfast, tidyfst, reshape2, cdata).

# Introduction

Regular expressions are powerful tools for text processing that are
available in many programming languages, including R. A regular
expression *pattern* or *regex* defines a set of *matches* in a
*subject* string. For some example subjects, consider the column names
of the famous iris data set in R: Species, Sepal.Length, Petal.Width,
etc. Some example patterns: a dot between square brackets \[.\] matches
a period, a dot by itself . matches any non-newline character, and a dot
followed by a star .\* matches zero or more non-newline characters.
Therefore the pattern .\*\[.\].\* matches zero or more non-newline
characters, followed by a period, followed by zero or more non-newline
characters. It would match Sepal.Length and Petal.Width, but it would
not match Species. For a more detailed discussion of regular
expressions, we refer the reader to help(regex) in R or the book of
@Friedl2002.

The focus of this article is patterns with capture groups, which are
typically defined using parentheses. For example, the pattern
(.\*)\[.\](.\*) results in the same matches as the pattern in the
previous paragraph, and it additionally allows the user to capture and
extract the substrings by group index (e.g., group 1 matches Sepal,
group 2 matches Length).

Named capture groups allow extracting the substring by name rather than
by index. Using names rather than indices is preferable in order to
create more readable regular expressions (names document the purpose of
each sub-pattern) and to create more readable R code (it is easier to
understand the intent of named references than numbered references). For
example, the pattern (?\<part\>.\*)\[.\](?\<dimension\>.\*) documents
that the flower part appears before the measurement dimension; the part
group matches Sepal and the dimension group matches Length.

Recently, @HOCKING2019-namedCapture proposes a new syntax for defining
named capture groups in R code. Using this new syntax, named capture
groups are specified using named arguments in R, which results in code
that is easier to read and modify than capture groups defined in string
literals. For example, the pattern in the previous paragraph can be
written as part = \".\*\", \"\[.\]\", dimension = \".\*\". Sub-patterns
can be grouped for clarity and/or re-used using lists, and numeric data
may be extracted with user-provided type conversion functions.

The main thesis of this article is that regular expressions can greatly
simplify the code required to specify wide-to-tall data reshaping
operations (when the input columns adhere to a regular naming
convention). For one such operation, the input is a "wide" table with
many columns, and the desired output is a "tall" table with more rows,
and some of the input columns are converted into a smaller number of
output columns (Figure [1](#fig:wide-to-tall){reference-type="ref"
reference="fig:wide-to-tall"}). To clarify the discussion, we first
define three terms that we will use to refer to the different types of
columns involved in this conversion:

Reshape

:   columns contain the data which is present in the same amount but in
    different shapes in the input and output. There are equivalent terms
    used in different R packages: varying in utils::reshape,
    measure.vars in melt (data.table, reshape2), etc.

Copy

:   columns contain data in the input which are each copied to multiple
    rows in the output ( id.vars in melt).

Capture

:   columns are only present in the output, and contain data which come
    from matching a capturing regex pattern to the input reshape column
    names.

For example, the wide iris data (W in
Figure [1](#fig:wide-to-tall){reference-type="ref"
reference="fig:wide-to-tall"}) have four numeric columns to reshape:
Sepal.Length, Sepal.Width, Petal.Length, Petal.Width. For some purposes
(e.g., displaying a histogram of each reshape input column using facets
in [ggplot2](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=ggplot2)), the desired
reshaping operation results in a table with a single reshape output
column (S in Figure [1](#fig:wide-to-tall){reference-type="ref"
reference="fig:wide-to-tall"}), two copied columns, and two columns
captured from the names of the reshaped input columns. For other
purposes (e.g., scatterplot to compare sepal and petal sizes) the
desired reshaping operation results in a table with multiple reshape
output columns (M1 with Sepal and Petal columns in
Figure [1](#fig:wide-to-tall){reference-type="ref"
reference="fig:wide-to-tall"}), two copied columns, and one column
captured from the names of the reshaped input columns.

![Two rows of the iris data set (W, black) are considered as the input
to a wide-to-tall reshape operation. Four input reshape columns are
converted to either a single output reshape column (S, blue) or multiple
(2) output reshape columns (M1, M2, red). Other output columns are
either copied from the non-reshaped input data, or captured from the
names of the reshaped input
columns.](figure-1-iris.pdf){#fig:wide-to-tall width="90%"}

In this article, our original contribution is the R package
[nc](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=nc) which provides a new
implementation of the previously proposed named capture regex syntax of
@HOCKING2019-namedCapture, in addition to several new functions that
perform wide-to-tall data reshaping using regular expressions. The main
new idea is to use a single named capture regular expression for
defining both (1) the subset of reshape input columns to convert and (2)
the additional capture output columns. We will show that this results in
a simple, powerful, non-repetitive syntax for wide-to-tall data
reshaping. A secondary contribution of this article is a detailed
comparison of current R functions for wide-to-tall data reshaping in
terms of syntax, computation times, and functionality
(Table [1](#tab:features){reference-type="ref"
reference="tab:features"}). Note that in this article, we do not discuss
tall-to-wide data reshaping, because regular expressions are not useful
in that case.

The organization of this article is as follows. The rest of this
introduction provides an overview of current R packages for regular
expressions and data reshaping. The second section describes the
proposed functions of the [nc](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=nc)
package, and then the third section provides detailed comparisons with
other R packages. The article concludes with a summary and discussion of
possible future work.

# Related work

There are many R functions which can extract tables from non-tabular
text using regular expressions. Recommended R package functions include
base::regexpr and base::gregexpr as well as utils::strcapture. CRAN
packages which provide various functions for text processing using
regular expressions include
[namedCapture](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=namedCapture)
[@namedCapture], [rematch2](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=rematch2)
[@rematch2], [rex](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=rex) [@rex],
[stringr](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=stringr) [@stringr],
[stringi](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=stringi) [@stringi],
[tidyr](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=tidyr) [@tidyr], and
[re2r](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=re2r) [@re2r]. We refer the
reader to our previous research paper for a detailed comparison of these
packages [@HOCKING2019-namedCapture].

For reshaping data from wide (one row with many columns) to tall (one
column with many rows), there are several different R functions that
provide similar functionality. Each function supports a different set of
features (Table [1](#tab:features){reference-type="ref"
reference="tab:features"}); each feature/column is explained in detail
below:

single

:   refers to support for converting input reshape columns of the same
    type to a single reshape output column.

multiple

:   refers to support for converting input reshape columns of possibly
    different types to multiple output reshape columns; "if sorted"
    means that conversion works correctly only if the input reshape
    columns are sorted in a regular order, e.g., Sepal.Length,
    Sepal.Width, Petal.Length, Petal.Width; "yes" means that conversion
    works correctly even if they are not sorted, e.g., Sepal.Length,
    Sepal.Width, Petal.Width, Petal.Length.

regex

:   refers to support for regular expressions; "match" means a pattern
    is used to match the input column names; "capture" means that the
    specified pattern is used to create new output capture columns ---
    this is especially useful when the names consist of several distinct
    pieces of information, e.g., Sepal.Length; "no" means that regular
    expressions are not directly supported (although base::grep can
    always be used).

na.rm

:   refers to support for removing missing values.

types

:   refers to support for converting captured text to numeric output
    columns.

list

:   refers to support for output of list columns.

  : Reshaping functions in R support various features: "single" for
  converting input columns into a single output column; "multiple" for
  converting input columns (either "if sorted" in a regular order, or
  "yes" for any order) into multiple output columns of possibly
  different types; "regex" for regular expressions to "match" input
  column names or to "capture" and create new output column names;
  "na.rm" for removal of missing values; "types" for converting input
  column names to non-character output columns; "list" for output of
  list columns.
:::

Recommended R package functions include stats::reshape and utils::stack
for reshaping data from wide to tall. Of the features listed in
Table [1](#tab:features){reference-type="ref" reference="tab:features"},
utils::stack only supports output with a single reshape column, whereas
stats::reshape supports the following features. For data with regular
input column names (output column, separator, time value), regular
expressions can be used to specify the separator (e.g., in Sepal.Length,
Sepal is output column, dot is separator, Length is time value).
Multiple output columns are supported, but incorrect output may be
computed if input columns are not sorted in a regular order. The time
value is output to a capture column named time by default. Automatic
type conversion is performed on time values when possible, but custom
type conversion functions are not supported. There is neither support
for missing value removal nor list column output.

The tidyr package provides two functions for reshaping data from wide to
tall format: gather and pivot_longer. The older gather function only
supports converting input reshape columns to a single output reshape
column (not multiple). The input reshape columns to convert may not be
directly specified using regular expressions; instead, R expressions
such as x:y can be used to indicate all columns starting from x and
ending with y. It does support limited type conversion; if the convert =
TRUE argument is specified, the utils::type.convert function is used to
convert the input column names to numeric, integer, or logical. In
contrast, the newer pivot_longer also supports multiple output reshape
columns (even if input reshape columns are unsorted) and regular
expressions for specifying output capture columns (but to specify input
reshape columns with a regex, grep must be used). Arbitrary type
conversion is also supported in pivot_longer, via the names_transform
argument, which should be a named list of conversion functions. Both
functions support list columns and removing missing values, although
different arguments are used ( na.rm for gather, values_drop_na for
pivot_longer).

The [reshape2](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=reshape2) and
data.table packages each provide a melt function for converting data
from wide to tall [@Wickham2007; @Dowle2019]. The older reshape2 version
only supports converting input reshape columns to a single output
reshape column, whereas the newer data.table version also supports
multiple output reshape columns. Regular expressions are not supported
in reshape2, but can be used with data.table::patterns to match input
column names to convert (although the output can be incorrect if columns
are not sorted in a regular order). Neither function supports type
conversion, and both functions support removing missing values from the
output using the na.rm argument. List column output is supported in
data.table but not reshape2. The
[tidyfast](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=tidyfast) [@Barrett2020]
and [tidyfst](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=tidyfst)
[@HuangZhao2020] packages provide reshaping functions that use
data.table::melt internally (but do not support multiple output reshape
columns).

The [cdata](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=cdata) package provides
several functions for data reshaping, including rowrecs_to_blocks and
unpivot_to_blocks, which can convert data from wide to tall
[@Mount2019]. The simpler of the two functions is unpivot_to_blocks,
which supports a single output reshape column (interface similar to
reshape2::melt/ tidyr::gather). The user of rowrecs_to_blocks must
provide a control table that describes how the input should be reshaped
into the output. It, therefore, supports multiple output reshape columns
for possibly unsorted input columns. Both functions support list column
output, but other features from
Table [1](#tab:features){reference-type="ref" reference="tab:features"}
are not supported (regular expressions, missing value removal, type
conversion).

# Basic features for wide-to-tall data reshaping using regular expressions

The nc package provides new regular expression functionality based on
the syntax recently proposed by @HOCKING2019-namedCapture. During the
rest of the article, we give only a brief overview of this syntax; for a
more detailed review, please read the nc package vignettes. In this
section, we show how new nc functions can be used to reshape wide data
(with many columns) to tall data (with fewer columns, and more rows). We
begin by considering the two data visualization problems which were
mentioned in the introduction and which involve the familiar iris data
set.

## Single reshape output column

First, suppose we would like to visualize the univariate distribution of
each numeric variable. One way would be to use a histogram of each
numeric variable, with row facets for the flower part and column facets
for the measurement dimension. Our desired output, therefore, needs a
single column with all of the reshaped numeric data to plot
(Figure [1](#fig:wide-to-tall){reference-type="ref"
reference="fig:wide-to-tall"}, W$\rightarrow$S).

We can perform this operation using nc::capture_melt_single, which
inputs a data frame and a pattern which should match the names of the
input columns to reshape. Any input columns with names that do not match
the pattern are considered copy columns; the output also contains a
capture column for each group specified in the pattern:

::: Sinput
\> (iris.tall.single \<- nc::capture_melt_single( + iris, part =
\".\*\", \"\[.\]\", dim = \".\*\", value.name = \"cm\"))
:::

::: Soutput
Species part dim cm 1: setosa Sepal Length 5.1 2: setosa Sepal Length
4.9 3: setosa Sepal Length 4.7 4: setosa Sepal Length 4.6 5: setosa
Sepal Length 5.0 --- 596: virginica Petal Width 2.3 597: virginica Petal
Width 1.9 598: virginica Petal Width 2.0 599: virginica Petal Width 2.3
600: virginica Petal Width 1.8
:::

The code above can be read as follows. The first argument, iris
specifies the wide input to reshape (a data frame or data table). The
next three arguments ( part = \".\*\", \"\[.\]\", dim = \".\*\") specify
the regex. Internally nc generates a capture group for each named
argument, so the generated regex pattern is (.\*)\[.\](.\*) in this
example. The value.name argument is not considered part of the regex and
instead specifies the name of the output reshape column.

The output above is a data table (a data frame subclass with special
methods with reference semantics) because data.table::melt is used
internally for the reshape operation. The output data table consists of
one copy column ( Species), two capture columns ( part, dim), and a
single reshape column ( cm). These data can be used to create the
desired histogram with ggplot2 via:

::: Sinput
\> library(ggplot2) \> ggplot(iris.tall.single) + facet_grid(part  
dim) + + theme_bw() + theme(panel.spacing = grid::unit(0,
\"lines\")) + + geom_histogram(aes(cm, fill = Species), color =
\"black\", bins = 40)
:::

![image](hocking-hist.pdf)

For comparison, we show how the same reshape operation can be
accomplished with the data.table package:

::: Sinput
\> iris.pattern \<- \"(.\*)\[.\](.\*)\" \> iris.wide \<-
data.table::as.data.table(iris) \> iris.tall \<- data.table::melt( +
iris.wide, measure = patterns(iris.pattern), value.name = \"cm\") \>
iris.tall\[, ':='(part = sub(iris.pattern, \"\
1\", variable), + dim = sub(iris.pattern, \"\
2\", variable))\]\[\]
:::

::: Soutput
Species variable cm part dim 1: setosa Sepal.Length 5.1 Sepal Length 2:
setosa Sepal.Length 4.9 Sepal Length 3: setosa Sepal.Length 4.7 Sepal
Length 4: setosa Sepal.Length 4.6 Sepal Length 5: setosa Sepal.Length
5.0 Sepal Length --- 596: virginica Petal.Width 2.3 Petal Width 597:
virginica Petal.Width 1.9 Petal Width 598: virginica Petal.Width 2.0
Petal Width 599: virginica Petal.Width 2.3 Petal Width 600: virginica
Petal.Width 1.8 Petal Width
:::

The code above uses data.table::melt with patterns which takes a regex
used to specify the four columns to reshape. The part and dim capture
columns must be created during a post-processing step. In this case, the
nc code is substantially simpler because the named capture regular
expression was used to specify both the input columns to reshape and the
capture columns to output.

Finally we show how the same reshape operation could be done using the
tidyr package:

::: Sinput
\> tidyr::pivot_longer(iris, matches(iris.pattern), values_to =
\"cm\", + names_to=c(\"part\", \"dim\"), names_pattern=iris.pattern)
:::

::: Soutput
\# A tibble: 600 x 4 Species part dim cm \<fct\> \<chr\> \<chr\> \<dbl\>
1 setosa Sepal Length 5.1 2 setosa Sepal Width 3.5 3 setosa Petal Length
1.4 4 setosa Petal Width 0.2 5 setosa Sepal Length 4.9 6 setosa Sepal
Width 3 7 setosa Petal Length 1.4 8 setosa Petal Width 0.2 9 setosa
Sepal Length 4.7 10 setosa Sepal Width 3.2 \# ... with 590 more rows
:::

The code above is almost as simple as the corresponding nc code, but
with one key difference. The output capture column names are defined in
the names_to argument, which is far away from the definition of the
groups in iris.pattern. In this simple example with two groups in the
regex this separation of related concepts is not a huge problem, but the
nc syntax should be preferred for more complex patterns (with more
groups) in order to keep the group names and sub-patterns closer and
easier to maintain/read in the code.

## Multiple reshape output columns

For the second data reshaping task, suppose we want to determine whether
or not sepals are larger than petals for each measurement dimension and
species. We could use a scatterplot of sepal versus petal, with a facet
for measurement dimension. We, therefore, need a data table with two
reshape output columns: a Sepal column to plot against a Petal column
(Figure [1](#fig:wide-to-tall){reference-type="ref"
reference="fig:wide-to-tall"}, W$\rightarrow$M1). We can perform this
operation using another function, nc::capture_melt_multiple, which
inputs a data frame and a pattern which must contain the special column
group and at least one other named group:

::: Sinput
\> (iris.parts \<- nc::capture_melt_multiple(iris, column = \".\*\",
\"\[.\]\", dim = \".\*\"))
:::

::: Soutput
Species dim Petal Sepal 1: setosa Length 1.4 5.1 2: setosa Length 1.4
4.9 3: setosa Length 1.3 4.7 4: setosa Length 1.5 4.6 5: setosa Length
1.4 5.0 --- 296: virginica Width 2.3 3.0 297: virginica Width 1.9 2.5
298: virginica Width 2.0 3.0 299: virginica Width 2.3 3.4 300: virginica
Width 1.8 3.0
:::

Again, any input columns with names that do not match the pattern are
considered copy columns ( Species in the example above). Each unique
value captured in the special column group becomes the name of an output
reshape column ( Petal, Sepal); other groups are used to create output
capture columns ( dim). These data can be used to create the scatterplot
using ggplot2 via:

::: Sinput
\> ggplot(iris.parts) + facet_grid(.   dim) + + theme_bw() +
theme(panel.spacing = grid::unit(0, \"lines\")) + + coord_equal() +
geom_abline(slope = 1, intercept = 0, color = \"grey\") + +
geom_point(aes(Petal, Sepal, color = Species), shape = 1)
:::

![image](hocking-scatter.pdf)

For comparison, we show how to output a data table with multiple reshape
output columns using the data.table and tidyr packages:

::: Sinput
\> iris.multiple \<- data.table::melt( + iris.wide, measure =
patterns(Petal=\"Petal\", Sepal=\"Sepal\")) \> iris.multiple\[, dim :=
c(\"Length\", \"Width\")\[variable\] \]
:::

::: Soutput
Species variable Petal Sepal dim 1: setosa 1 1.4 5.1 Length 2: setosa 1
1.4 4.9 Length 3: setosa 1 1.3 4.7 Length 4: setosa 1 1.5 4.6 Length 5:
setosa 1 1.4 5.0 Length --- 296: virginica 2 2.3 3.0 Width 297:
virginica 2 1.9 2.5 Width 298: virginica 2 2.0 3.0 Width 299: virginica
2 2.3 3.4 Width 300: virginica 2 1.8 3.0 Width
:::

::: Sinput
\> tidyr::pivot_longer(iris, matches(iris.pattern), values_to =
\"cm\", + names_to=c(\".value\", \"dim\"), names_pattern=iris.pattern)
:::

::: Soutput
\# A tibble: 300 x 4 Species dim Sepal Petal \<fct\> \<chr\> \<dbl\>
\<dbl\> 1 setosa Length 5.1 1.4 2 setosa Width 3.5 0.2 3 setosa Length
4.9 1.4 4 setosa Width 3 0.2 5 setosa Length 4.7 1.3 6 setosa Width 3.2
0.2 7 setosa Length 4.6 1.5 8 setosa Width 3.1 0.2 9 setosa Length 5 1.4
10 setosa Width 3.6 0.2 \# ... with 290 more rows
:::

The code above computes equivalent results but suffers from the same
drawbacks as discussed in the previous section (repetition, separation
of pattern and group names).

To conclude this section, nc provides two new functions for data
reshaping using regular expressions. Both functions input a data frame
to reshape and a pattern to match with the column names. For
nc::capture_melt_single, all matching input columns are reshaped in the
output to a single column which is named using the value.name argument.
For nc::capture_melt_multiple the output is multiple reshape columns
with names defined by the values captured in the special column group.
Values from other groups are stored in capture columns in the output.
Both functions support the output of numeric capture columns via
user-specified type conversion functions, as we will see in the next
section.

# Comparisons which highlight differences with other packages

In this section, we compare the new data reshaping functions in the nc
package with similar functions in other packages. We aim to demonstrate
that the new nc syntax is often more convenient and less repetitive
without sacrificing speed.

## Building a complex pattern from smaller sub-patterns

In terms of functionality for wide-to-tall data reshaping, the most
similar package to nc is tidyr
(Table [1](#tab:features){reference-type="ref"
reference="tab:features"}). One advantage of nc is that complex patterns
may be defined in terms of simpler sub-patterns, which can include group
names and type conversion functions. Integrating these three pieces
results in a syntax that is easy to read as well; it is more difficult
to build and read complex patterns using tidyr syntax, which requires
specifying regex pattern strings, group names, and types as separate
arguments. For example, consider a data set from the World Health
Organization (WHO):

::: Sinput
\> data(who, package = \"tidyr\") \> set.seed(1);sample(names(who), 10)
:::

::: Soutput
\"newrel_f3544\" \"year\" \"new_ep_m65\" \"country\" \"new_ep_m1524\"
\[6\] \"new_sn_m4554\" \"new_ep_f3544\" \"new_sp_f2534\" \"new_sp_f65\"
\"newrel_m4554\"
:::

::: Sinput
\>
:::

Each reshape column name starts with new and has three distinct pieces
of information: diagnosis type (e.g., ep, rel), gender ( m or f), and
age range (e.g., 1524, 4554). We extract all three pieces of information
below and include a function for converting gender to a factor with
levels in a specific (non-default) order:

::: Sinput
\> nc.who.sub.pattern \<- list( + \"new\_?\", diagnosis = \".\*\",
\"\_\", + gender = \".\", function(mf)factor(mf, c(\"m\", \"f\"))) \>
nc.who.ages \<- nc::capture_melt_single(who, nc.who.sub.pattern, ages =

:::

First, note that nc.who.sub.pattern is a sub-pattern list variable that
we have used as the first part of the pattern in the call to
nc::capture_melt_single above (and we will use that sub-pattern again
below). Sub-pattern lists may contain regex character strings (patterns
to match), functions (for converting the previous capture group), or
other sub-pattern lists. The reshaped output is a data table with gender
converted to a factor --- this can also be done using
tidyr::pivot_longer:

::: Sinput
\> tidyr.who.sub.names \<- c(\"diagnosis\", \"gender\") #L0 \>
tidyr.who.sub.pattern \<- \"new\_?(.\*)\_(.)\" #L1 \> tidyr.who.pattern
\<- paste0(tidyr.who.sub.pattern, \"(.\*)\") #L2 \> tidyr::pivot_longer(
#L3 + who, cols = matches(tidyr.who.pattern), #L4 + names_to =
c(tidyr.who.sub.names, \"ages\"), #L5 + names_ptypes = list(gender =
factor(levels = c(\"m\", \"f\"))), #L6 + names_pattern =
tidyr.who.pattern)\[1:2,\] #L7
:::

NA
:::

In the code above, we first define a sub-pattern variable for the
diagnosis and gender capture groups, as we did using nc. One difference
is that the tidyr sub-pattern variable is a string with un-named capture
groups, whereas the nc sub-pattern variable is a list which includes
capture group names as well as a type conversion function. These three
parameters are specified as three separate arguments in tidyr, which
results in some separation (e.g., group names defined on L0 and L5 but
corresponding sub-patterns defined on L1 and L2) and repetition (e.g.,
gender appears on L0 and L6) in the code. The pattern also must be
repeated: first in the cols argument (L4) to specify the set of input
reshape columns, second in the names_pattern argument (L7) to specify
the conversion from input reshape column names to output capture column
values.

Now suppose we want to extract two numeric columns from ages, for
example, to use as interval-censored outputs in a survival regression.
Using nc we can use the previously defined sub-pattern (including the
previously defined group names and type conversion function) as the
first part of a larger pattern:

::: Sinput
\> who.typed \<- nc::capture_melt_single(who, nc.who.sub.pattern, ages =
list( + ymin = \"0\|\[0-9\]2\", as.numeric, + ymax = \"\[0-9\]0,2\",
function(x)ifelse(x == \"\", Inf, as.numeric(x)))) \> who.typed\[1:2\]
:::

::: Soutput
country iso2 iso3 year diagnosis gender ages ymin ymax value 1:

:::

::: Sinput
\> who.typed\[, .(rows = .N), by = .(ages, ymin, ymax)\]
:::

::: Soutput

65 Inf 10844
:::

Note in the code above that each group name, regex pattern string, and
the corresponding type conversion function appears on the same line ---
this syntax keeps these three related pieces of information close
together, which makes complex patterns easier to read and build from
smaller pieces. Also, note how an anonymous function is used to convert
the values captured in the ymax group to numeric (and it maps the empty
string to Inf). Such custom type conversion functions are supported by
tidyr since version 1.1.0 (early 2020), so we can do:

::: Sinput
\> tidyr.who.range.pattern \<- paste0(tidyr.who.sub.pattern,
\"((0\|\[0-9\]2)(\[0-9\]0,2))\") \> tidyr::pivot_longer( + who, cols =
matches(tidyr.who.range.pattern), + names_to = c(tidyr.who.sub.names,
\"ages\", \"ymin\", \"ymax\"), + names_transform = list( + gender =
function(x)factor(x, levels = c(\"m\", \"f\")), + ymin = as.numeric, +
ymax = function(x)ifelse(x == \"\", Inf, as.numeric(x))), +
names_pattern = tidyr.who.range.pattern)\[1:7,\]
:::

::: Soutput

:::

The code above uses the names_transform argument to define type
conversion functions, which requires some repetition (e.g., ymax and
ymin each appear twice).

To conclude this comparison, we have seen that nc syntax makes it easy
to read and write complex patterns because it keeps group-specific names
and type conversion functions near the corresponding sub-patterns. We
have also shown that repetition is often necessary with tidyr (e.g.,
pattern, group names), whereas such repetition can be avoided by using
nc.

## Comparison with other packages which support multiple reshape output columns

In this section, we demonstrate the advantages of using nc over several
alternatives which support multiple reshape output columns. A major
advantage is that nc directly supports regular expressions for defining
the input reshape columns and output capture columns. Another advantage
is that nc always returns a correct output data set with multiple
reshape columns, even when the input columns are not sorted in a regular
order. For example, consider the following simple data set in which the
columns are not in regular order:

::: Sinput
\> (TC \<- data.table::data.table( + treatment.age = 13, +
control.gender = \"M\", + treatment.gender = \"F\", + control.age = 25))
:::

::: Soutput
treatment.age control.gender treatment.gender control.age 1: 13 M F 25
:::

It is clear from the table above that the treatment group consists of a
teenage female, whereas the control group consists of a male aged 25
(not the best experimental design, but easy to remember for the
demonstration in this section). Assume we need an output data table with
two reshape columns ( age and gender) as well as a capture column (
group). The nc syntax we would use is:

::: Sinput
\> nc::capture_melt_multiple(TC, group = \".\*\", \"\[.\]\", column =
\".\*\")
:::

::: Soutput
group age gender 1: control 25 M 2: treatment 13 F
:::

The correct result is computed above because nc reshapes based on the
input column names (the order of the input columns is not relevant). A
naïve user may attempt to perform this reshape using
data.table::patterns:

::: Sinput
\> data.table::melt(TC, measure.vars = patterns(age = \"age\", gender =
\"gender\"))
:::

::: Soutput
variable age gender 1: 1 13 M 2: 2 25 F
:::

First, note that the syntax above requires repetition of age and gender
(in names and in pattern strings). Also, it is clear that the result is
incorrect! Actually, the patterns function is working as documented; it
"returns the matching indices" of the provided regex. However, since the
input columns are not sorted in regular order, melt returns an incorrect
result (this is an incorrect use of these functions, not a bug). To get
a correct result, we can provide a list of index vectors:

::: Sinput
\> data.table::melt(TC, measure.vars = list(age = c(1,4), gender =
c(3,2)))
:::

::: Soutput
variable age gender 1: 1 13 F 2: 2 25 M
:::

This is what nc does internally; it also converts the variable output
column to a more interpretable/useful capture column (e.g., group
above).

The stats::reshape function suffers from the same issue as the patterns
usage above. Another issue with this function is that it assumes the
output reshape column names are the first part of the input column names
(e.g., Figure [1](#fig:wide-to-tall){reference-type="ref"
reference="fig:wide-to-tall"}, W$\rightarrow$M1). When input column
names have a different structure (e.g.,
Figure [1](#fig:wide-to-tall){reference-type="ref"
reference="fig:wide-to-tall"}, W$\rightarrow$M2), they must be renamed,
putting the desired output reshape column names first:

::: Sinput
\> TC.renamed \<- structure(TC, names = sub(\"(.\*)\[.\](.\*)\", \"\
2.\
1\", names(TC))) \> stats::reshape(TC.renamed, 1:4, direction =
\"long\", timevar = \"group\")
:::

::: Soutput
group age gender id 1: treatment 13 M 1 2: control 25 F 1
:::

However, the result above still contains incorrect results in the gender
column. The correct result can be obtained by sorting the input column
names:

::: Sinput
\> TC.sorted \<- data.frame(TC.renamed)\[, sort(names(TC.renamed))\] \>
stats::reshape(TC.sorted, 1:4, direction = \"long\", timevar =
\"group\")
:::

::: Soutput
group age gender id 1.control control 25 M 1 1.treatment treatment 13 F
1
:::

After renaming and sorting the input columns, the correct result is
obtained using stats::reshape. Another way to obtain a correct result is
with the cdata package:

::: Sinput
\> cdata::rowrecs_to_blocks(TC, controlTable = data.frame( + group =
c(\"treatment\", \"control\"), + age = c(\"treatment.age\",
\"control.age\"), + gender = c(\"treatment.gender\",
\"control.gender\"), + stringsAsFactors = FALSE))
:::

::: Soutput
group age gender 1 treatment 13 F 2 control 25 M
:::

The cdata package is very powerful and can handle many more types of
data reshaping operations than nc. However, it requires a very explicit
definition of the desired conversion in terms of a control table, which
results in rather verbose code. In contrast, the terse regular
expression syntax of nc is a more implicit approach, which assumes the
input columns to reshape have regular names.

To conclude this section, we have discussed some advantages of nc
relative to other R packages. Input columns with regular names do not
need to be renamed/sorted for nc functions, whereas renaming/sorting may
be necessary using stats::reshape. Verbose/explicit control table code
is always necessary with cdata, whereas a terse/implicit regular
expression syntax is used with nc to simplify the definition of reshape
operations.

## Comparing computation times of functions for wide-to-tall data reshaping

![ Timings for computing a tall output table with multiple (2) reshape
columns from a wide input table with 8 reshape columns and a variable
number of rows
(x-axis).](figure-iris-rows-new.pdf){#fig:timings-multiple-rows
width="\\textwidth"}

In previous sections, we have shown that the nc package provides a
convenient syntax for defining wide-to-tall reshape operations. In this
section, we investigate whether this convenience comes at the cost of
increased computation time. We aim to demonstrate that the computation
time required for the proposed nc package is comparable with other
packages for data reshaping. In particular, since nc is implemented
using data.table, we expect that nc should be slightly slower than
data.table (by only the amount of time required for regex matching). In
our result figures, we show the median and quartiles over 10 timings
using the
[microbenchmark](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=microbenchmark)
package on an Intel Core i7-8700 3.20GHz processor. Note that these
timings include both the regex matching (which should be relatively
fast) and the data reshaping operation (which should be relatively
slow). We varied the number of rows/columns in each experiment by
copying/duplicating the rows/columns in each source data set.

First, we performed timings on variants of the iris data with a variable
number of rows and twice the original number of reshape columns (8). The
input reshape column names were of the form day1.Sepal.Length,
day2.Sepal.Length, day1.Sepal.Width, etc. Since the desired output has
two reshape columns ( Sepal and Petal), we considered packages which
support multiple output columns (cdata, stats, tidyr, nc, data.table).
As expected, we observed that all algorithms have similar asymptotic
time complexity
(Figure [2](#fig:timings-multiple-rows){reference-type="ref"
reference="fig:timings-multiple-rows"}). We observed that nc is slightly
slower than data.table (by constant factors), slightly faster than the
other packages (cdata, stats), and about the same speed as tidyr.

Second, we performed similar timings on variants of the iris data with a
variable number of columns and the original number of rows (150). As in
the previous experiment, we expected that all functions would have
similar slopes, indicating linear asymptotic time complexity.
Surprisingly, we observed on the log-log plot
(Figure [3](#fig:timings-multiple-cols){reference-type="ref"
reference="fig:timings-multiple-cols"}) that cdata has a larger
asymptotic slope than the other packages, which suggests its time
complexity may be super-linear in the number of columns to reshape. The
other packages differed by constant factors, with data.table being
fastest, followed by tidyr, nc, cdata, and finally the slowest stats.
All packages except stats performed the operation in less than 1 second
for 1,000 or fewer columns. This comparison confirms the expectation
that nc speed is comparable to other packages.

Third, we performed timings on versions of the WHO data with a variable
number of duplicated rows and the original number of columns (56). We
ran reshaping functions from several additional packages (utils,
reshape2, tidyfast) that can compute the desired output table with a
single reshape output column. We computed the amount of time it takes to
create zero or four capture output columns (with additional
post-processing steps for tidyfast::dt_pivot_longer, reshape2::melt,
tidyr::gather, cdata::unpivot_to_blocks). We expected that functions
which require additional post-processing steps should be slower by
constant factors. As we expected, all functions appear to have similar
asymptotic time complexity and differ only in terms of constant factors.
For zero capture output columns, the slowest functions were
stats::reshape and cdata::unpivot_to_blocks, which were the only ones to
take more than one second for 10,000 input rows. The fastest functions
were data.table::melt and tidyfast::dt_pivot_longer (about 10ms for
10,000 input rows). As expected, for four capture output columns, the
functions which require post-processing were slower, and the fastest
functions were data.table::melt and nc::capture_melt_single.

columns from a wide input table with 150 rows and a variable number of
columns to reshape
(x-axis).](figure-iris-cols-new.pdf){#fig:timings-multiple-cols
width="\\textwidth"}

Finally, we performed similar timings on variants of the WHO data with a
variable number of columns and a fixed number of rows (11). The desired
output again has a single reshape output column, and we again tried
computing either zero or four capture output columns. We observed
timings (Figure [5](#fig:timings-single-cols){reference-type="ref"
reference="fig:timings-single-cols"}) with similar asymptotic trends as
in the previous comparisons. In particular, timings for most packages
appear to be linear in the number of input reshape columns, and timings
for cdata appear to be super-linear for a large number of columns. These
data indicate that nc speed is similar to comparable R packages.

# Discussion and conclusions

In this paper, we described the nc package and its new functions for
regular expressions and data reshaping. The nc package allows a user to
define a regular expression in R code, along with capture group names
and corresponding type conversion functions. We showed how this syntax
makes it easy to define complex regular expressions in terms of simpler
sub-patterns, while providing a uniform interface to three regex engines
(ICU, PCRE, RE2). We showed several examples of how nc can be used for
wide-to-tall data reshaping. We provided a detailed comparison with
other data reshaping functions in terms of syntax, functionality, and
computation time.

In all of our speed comparisons, we observed that the speed of nc is
similar to other R functions for wide-to-tall data reshaping. We
expected that all R functions would have linear asymptotic timings, and
differ only in constant factors. We were surprised to observe in our
empirical timings that the cdata package appears to have asymptotic time
complexity that is super-linear in the number of columns to reshape.
This result suggests that the speed of cdata could be improved by
adopting one of the linear time reshaping algorithms used in the other
packages.

The tidyr::pivot_longer function provides a feature set which is most
similar to nc data reshaping functions. We showed that both packages
could perform the same data reshaping operations, but nc provides a
syntax that reduces repetition in user code. Another advantage is that
nc R code allows sub-pattern lists which contain group names, regex
patterns, and type conversion functions, whereas in tidyr these three
related pieces of information must be defined in seperate arguments.
Therefore nc syntax may be preferable in order to ease the definition of
complex patterns and to avoid repetition in user code.

width="\\textwidth"}

In nc, there are two different functions for wide-to-tall data
reshaping: nc::capture_melt_single computes a single output reshape
column, and nc::capture_melt_multiple computes multiple output reshape
columns. In contrast, other functions that support multiple output
reshape columns also support a single output reshape column
(Table [1](#tab:features){reference-type="ref"
reference="tab:features"}). It is natural to ask whether these two nc
functions could be combined into a single function that could handle
both kinds of output. Of course, it is possible, but we prefer to keep
the two functions separate in order to provide more specific/informative
documentation, examples, and error messages.

We have shown how the nc package provides a powerful and efficient new
syntax for wide-to-tall data reshaping using regular expressions. The
inverse operation, tall-to-wide data reshaping, is not supported. For
tall-to-wide reshaping operations, we recommend using the efficient
implementation in data.table::dcast.

## Future work

For future work, we will be interested to explore other operations and R
packages/functions which could be simplified using regular expressions.
For example, the tidyr::pivot_longer function requires some repetition
of the pattern (in names_pattern and cols arguments); it could be
simplified by changing the behavior when names_pattern is specified, and
cols is not (currently an error, could instead set cols to the set of
columns which match names_pattern).

Another example where there is room for improvement is data.table::melt,
which we have shown requires some post-processing steps to output
capture columns. As a result of this research, we have proposed changes
to data.table::melt[^1] that allow efficient specification and output of
capture columns. Since nc uses data.table internally, we plan to
eventually use these changes for speedups of nc functions.
