title: Wide-to-tall Data Reshaping Using Regular Expressions and the nc Package
abstract: Regular expressions are powerful tools for extracting tables from non-tabular
  text data. Capturing regular expressions that describe the information to extract
  from column names can be especially useful when reshaping a data table from wide
  (few rows with many regularly named columns) to tall (fewer columns with more rows).
  We present the R package nc (short for named capture), which provides functions
  for wide-to-tall data reshaping using regular expressions. We describe the main
  new ideas of nc, and provide detailed comparisons with related R packages (stats,
  utils, data.table, tidyr, tidyfast, tidyfst, reshape2, cdata).
