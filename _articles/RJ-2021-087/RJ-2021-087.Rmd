title: 'NGSSEML: Non-Gaussian State Space with Exact Marginal Likelihood'
abstract: 'The number of packages/software for Gaussian State Space models has increased
  over recent decades. However, there are very few codes available for non-Gaussian
  State Space (NGSS) models due to analytical intractability that prevents exact calculations.
  One of the few tractable exceptions is the family of NGSS with exact marginal likelihood,
  named NGSSEML. In this work, we present the wide range of data formats and distributions
  handled by NGSSEML and a package in the R language to perform classical and Bayesian
  inference for them. Special functions for filtering, forecasting, and smoothing
  procedures and the exact calculation of the marginal likelihood function are provided.
  The methods implemented in the package are illustrated for count and volatility
  time series and some reliability/survival models, showing that the codes are easy
  to handle. Therefore, the NGSSEML family emerges as a simple and interesting option/alternative
  for modeling non-Gaussian time-varying structures commonly encountered in time series
  and reliability/survival studies. Keywords: Bayesian, classical inference, reliability,
  smoothing, time series, software R'
