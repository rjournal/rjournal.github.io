title: Debugging grid Graphics
abstract: A graphical scene that has been produced using the grid graphics package
  consists of grobs (graphical objects) and viewports. This article describes functions
  that allow the exploration and inspection of the grobs and viewports in a grid scene,
  including several functions that are available in a new package called gridDebug.
  The ability to explore the grobs and viewports in a grid scene is useful for adding
  more drawing to a scene that was produced using grid and for understanding and debugging
  the grid code that produced a scene.
