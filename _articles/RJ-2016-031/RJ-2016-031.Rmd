title: 'QPot: An R Package for Stochastic Differential Equation Quasi-Potential Analysis'
abstract: QPot (pronounced kyoo + p ät) is an R package for analyzing two-dimensional
  systems of stochastic differential equations. It provides users with a wide range
  of tools to simulate, analyze, and visualize the dynamics of these systems. One
  of QPot’s key features is the computation of the quasi-potential, an important tool
  for studying stochastic systems. Quasi-potentials are particularly useful for comparing
  the relative stabilities of equilibria in systems with alternative stable states.
  This paper describes QPot’s primary functions, and explains how quasi-potentials
  can yield insights about the dynamics of stochastic systems. Three worked examples
  guide users through the application of QPot’s functions.
