title: Generalized Estimating Equations using the new R package glmtoolbox
abstract: ' This paper introduces a very comprehensive implementation, available in
  the new `R` package `glmtoolbox`, of a very flexible statistical tool known as Generalized
  Estimating Equations (GEE), which analyzes cluster correlated data utilizing marginal
  models. As well as providing more built-in structures for the working correlation
  matrix than other GEE implementations in `R`, this GEE implementation also allows
  the user to: $(1)$ compute several estimates of the variance-covariance matrix of
  the estimators of the parameters of interest; $(2)$ compute several criteria to
  assist the selection of the structure for the working-correlation matrix; $(3)$
  compare nested models using the Wald test as well as the generalized score test;
  $(4)$ assess the goodness-of-fit of the model using Pearson-, deviance- and Mahalanobis-type
  residuals; $(5)$ perform sensibility analysis using the global influence approach
  (that is, dfbeta statistic and Cook''s distance) as well as the local influence
  approach; $(6)$ use several criteria to perform variable selection using a hybrid
  stepwise procedure; $(7)$ fit models with nonlinear predictors; $(8)$ handle dropout-type
  missing data under MAR rather than MCAR assumption by using observation-specific
  or cluster-specific weighted methods. The capabilities of this GEE implementation
  are illustrated by analyzing four real datasets obtained from longitudinal studies. '
