title: An Interactive Survey Application for Validating Social Network Analysis Techniques
abstract: Social network analysis is extremely well supported by the R community and
  is routinely used for studying the relationships between people engaged in collaborative
  activities. While there has been rapid development of new approaches and metrics
  in this field, the challenging question of validity (how well insights derived from
  social networks agree with reality) is often difficult to address. We propose the
  use of several R packages to generate interactive surveys that are specifically
  well suited for validating social network analyses. Using our web-based survey application,
  we were able to validate the results of applying community-detection algorithms
  to infer the organizational structure of software developers contributing to open-source
  projects.
