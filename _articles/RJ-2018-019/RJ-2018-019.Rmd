title: Tackling Uncertainties of Species Distribution Model Projections with Package
  mopa
abstract: Species Distribution Models (SDMs) constitute an important tool to assist
  decision-making in environmental conservation and planning in the context of climate
  change. Nevertheless, SDM pro jections are affected by a wide range of uncertainty
  factors (related to training data, climate projections and SDM techniques), which
  limit their potential value and credibility. The new package mopa pro vides tools
  for designing comprehensive multi-factor SDM ensemble experiments, combining multiple
  sources of uncertainty (e.g. baseline climate, pseudo-absence realizations, SDM
  techniques, future projections) and allowing to assess their contribution to the
  overall spread of the ensemble projection. In addition, mopa is seamlessly integrated
  with the climate4R bundle and allows straightforward retrieval and post-processing
  of state-of-the-art climate datasets (including observations and climate change
  projections), thus facilitating the proper analysis of key uncertainty factors related
  to climate data.
