title: openair - Data Analysis Tools for the Air Quality Community
abstract: The openair package contains data analysis tools for the air quality community.
  This paper provides an overview of data importers, main functions, and selected
  utilities and workhorse functions within the package and the function output class,
  as of package version 0.4-14. It is intended as an explanation of the rationale
  for the package and a technical description for those wishing to work more interactively
  with the main functions or develop additional functions to support ‘higher level’
  use of openair and R. Large volumes of air quality data are routinely collected
  for regulatory purposes, but few of those in local authorities and government bodies
  tasked with this responsibility have the time, expertise or funds to comprehensively
  analyse this potential resource (Chow and Watson, 2008). Furthermore, few of these
  institutions can routinely access the more powerful statistical methods typically
  required to make the most effective use of such data without a suite of often expensive
  and niche-application proprietary software products. This in turn places large cost
  and time burdens on both these institutions and others (e.g. academic or commercial)
  wishing to contribute to this work. In addition, such collaborative working practices
  can also become highly restricted and polarised if data analysis undertaken by one
  partner cannot be validated or replicated by another because they lack access to
  the same licensed products. Being freely distributed under general licence, R has
  the obvious potential to act as a common platform for those routinely collecting
  and archiving data and the wider air quality community. This potential has already
  been proven in several other research areas, and commonly cited ex amples include
  the Bioconductor project (Gentleman et al, 2004) and the Epitools collaboration
  (http://www.medepi.com/epitools). However, what is perhaps most inspiring is the
  degree of trans parency that has been demonstrated by the recent public analysis
  of climate change data in R and as sociated open debate (http://chartsgraphs.wordpress.com/category/r-climate-data-analysis
  tool/). Anyone affected by a policy decision, could potentially have unlimited access
  to scrutinise both the tools and data used to shape that decision.
