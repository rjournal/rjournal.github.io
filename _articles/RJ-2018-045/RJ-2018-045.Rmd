title: Basis-Adaptive Selection Algorithm in dr-package
abstract: Sufficient dimension reduction (SDR) turns out to be a useful dimension
  reduction tool in high-dimensional regression analysis. Weisberg (2002) developed
  the dr-package to implement the four most popular SDR methods. However, the package
  does not provide any clear guidelines as to which method should be used given a
  data. Since the four methods may provide dramatically different dimension reduction
  results, the selection in the dr-package is problematic for statistical practitioners.
  In this paper, a basis-adaptive selection algorithm is developed in order to relieve
  this issue. The basic idea is to select an SDR method that provides the highest
  correlation between the basis estimates obtained by the four classical SDR methods.
  A real data example and numerical studies confirm the practical usefulness of the
  developed algorithm.
