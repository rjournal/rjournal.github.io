title: A Computational Analysis of the Dynamics of R Style Based on 108 Million Lines
  of Code from All CRAN Packages in the Past 21 Years
abstract: ' The flexibility of R and the diversity of the R community leads to a large
  number of programming styles applied in R packages. We have analyzed 108 million
  lines of R code from CRAN and quantified the evolution in popularity of 12 style-elements
  from 1998 to 2019. We attribute 3 main factors that drive changes in programming
  style: the effect of style-guides, the effect of introducing new features, and the
  effect of editors. We observe in the data that a consensus in programming style
  is forming, such as using lower snake case for function names (e.g. softplus_func)
  and \<- rather than = for assignment. '
