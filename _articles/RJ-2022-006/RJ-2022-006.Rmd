title: A Computational Analysis of the Dynamics of R Style Based on 108 Million Lines
  of Code from All CRAN Packages in the Past 21 Years
abstract: 'The flexibility of R and the diversity of the R community leads to a large
  number of programming styles applied in R packages. We have analyzed 108 million
  lines of R code from CRAN and quantified the evolution in popularity of 12 style-elements
  from 1998 to 2019. We attribute 3 main factors that drive changes in programming
  style: the effect of style-guides, the effect of introducing new features, and the
  effect of editors. We observe in the data that a consensus in programming style
  is forming, such as using lower snake case for function names (e.g. softplus_func)
  and \<- rather than = for assignment.'

# Introduction

R is flexible. For example, one can use `<-` or `=` as assignment
operators. The following two functions can both be correctly evaluated.

``` r
sum_of_square <- function(x) {
    return(sum(x^2))
}
```

``` r
sum_oF.square=function(x)
{
    sum(x ^ 2)}
```

One area that can highlight this flexibility is naming conventions.
According to the previous research by @baaaath, there are at least 6
styles and none of the 6 has dominated the scene. Beyond naming
conventions investigated by @baaaath, there are style-elements that R
programmers have the freedom to adopt, e.g. whether or not to add spaces
around infix operators, use double quotation marks or single quotation
marks to denote strings. On one hand, these variations provide
programmers with freedom. On the other hand, these variations can
confuse new programmers and can have dire effects on program
comprehension. Also, incompatibility between programming styles might
also affect reusability, maintainability [@elish], and open source
collaboration [@wang].

Various efforts to standardize the programming style, e.g. Google's R
Style Guide [@google], the Tidyverse Style Guide [@tidyverse],
Bioconductor Coding Style [@bioconductor], are available
(Table [1](#tab:table1)) [^1].

Among the 3 style-guides, the major differences are the suggested naming
convention and indentation, as highlighted in Table [1](#tab:table1).
Other style-elements are essentially the same. These style guides are
based on possible improvement in code quality, e.g. style-elements that
improve program comprehension [@oman]. However, we argue that one should
first study the current situation, and preferably, the historical
development, of programming style variations (PSV) to supplement these
standardization efforts. We have undertaken such a task, so that the
larger R communities can have a baseline to evaluate the effectiveness
of those standardization efforts. Also, we can have a better
understanding of the factors driving increase and decrease in PSV
historically, such that more effective standardization efforts can be
formulated.

# Analysis

## Data Source

On July 1, 2020, we cloned a local mirror of CRAN using the rsync method
suggested in the CRAN Mirror HOWTO [@cranminihowto]. [^2] Our local
mirror contains all contributed packages as tarball files (.tar.gz). By
all contributed packages, we mean packages actively listed online on the
CRAN website as well as orphaned and archived packages. In this
analysis, we include all active, orphaned and archived packages.

In order to facilitate the analysis, we have developed the package
`baaugwo` [@chan2] to extract all R source code and metadata from these
tarballs. In this study, only the source code from the `/R` directory of
each tarball file is included. We have also archived the metadata from
the `DESCRIPTION` and `NAMESPACE` files from the tarballs.

In order to cancel out the over-representation effect of multiple
submissions in a year by a particular package, we have applied the
*\"one-submission-per-year\"* rule to randomly selected only one
submission from a year for each package. Unless otherwise noticed, we
present below the analysis of this *\"one-submission-per-year\"* sample.
Similarly, unless otherwise noticed, the unit of the analysis is
*exported function*. The study period for this study is from 1998 to
2019.

## Quantification of PSV

All exported functions in our sample are parsed into a parse tree using
the parser from the [*lintr*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=lintr)
[@lintr] package.

These parse trees were then filtered for lines with function definition
and then linted them using the linters from the lintr package to detect
for various style-elements. Style-elements considered in this study are:

#### fx_assign

Use = as assignment operators

``` r
softplusFunc = function(value, leaky = FALSE) {
    if (leaky) {
        warnings("using leaky RELU!")
        return(ifelse(value > 0L, value, value * 0.01))
    }
    return(log(1L + exp(value)))
}
```

#### fx_opencurly

An open curly is on its own line

``` r
softplusFunc <- function(value, leaky = FALSE) 
{
    if (leaky) 
    {
        warnings("using leaky RELU!")
        return(ifelse(value > 0L, value, value * 0.01))
    }
    return(log(1L + exp(value)))
}
```

#### fx_infix

No spaces are added around infix operators.

``` r
softplusFunc<-function(value, leaky=FALSE) {
    if (leaky) {
        warnings("using leaky RELU!")
        return(ifelse(value>0L, value, value*0.01))
    }
    return(log(1L+exp(value)))
}
```

#### fx_integer

Not explicitly type integers

``` r
softplusFunc <- function(value, leaky = FALSE) {
    if (leaky) {
        warnings("using leaky RELU!")
        return(ifelse(value > 0, value, value * 0.01))
    }
    return(log(1 + exp(value)))
}
```

#### fx_singleq

Use single quotation marks for strings

``` r
softplusFunc <- function(value, leaky = FALSE) {
    if (leaky) {
        warnings('using leaky RELU!')
        return(ifelse(value > 0L, value, value * 0.01))
    }
    return(log(1L + exp(value)))
}
```

#### fx_commas

No space is added after commas

``` r
softplusFunc <- function(value,leaky = FALSE) {
    if (leaky) {
        warnings("using leaky RELU!")
        return(ifelse(value > 0L,value,value * 0.01))
    }
    return(log(1L + exp(value)))
}
```

#### fx_semi

Use semicolons to terminate lines

``` r
softplusFunc <- function(value, leaky = FALSE) {
    if (leaky) {
        warnings("using leaky RELU!");
        return(ifelse(value > 0L, value, value * 0.01));
    }
    return(log(1L + exp(value)));
}
```

#### fx_t_f

Use T/F instead of TRUE / FALSE

``` r
softplusFunc <- function(value, leaky = F) {
    if (leaky) {
        warnings("using leaky RELU!")
        return(ifelse(value > 0L, value, value * 0.01))
    }
    return(log(1L + exp(value)))
}
```

#### fx_closecurly

An close curly is not on its own line.

``` r
softplusFunc <- function(value, leaky = FALSE) {
    if (leaky) {
        warnings("using leaky RELU!")
        return(ifelse(value > 0L, value, value * 0.01)) }
    return(log(1L + exp(value))) }
```

#### fx_tab

Use tab to indent

``` r
softplusFunc <- function(value, leaky = FALSE) {
    if (leaky) {
        warnings("using leaky RELU!")
        return(ifelse(value > 0L, value, value * 0.01))
    }
    return(log(1L + exp(value)))
}
```

We have studied also the naming conventions of all included functions.
Using the similar technique of @baaaath, we classified function names
into the following 7 categories:

-   **alllower** softplusfunc
-   **ALLUPPER** SOFTPLUSFUNC
-   **UpperCamel** SoftPlusFunc
-   **lowerCamel** softPlusFunc
-   **lower_snake** soft_plus_func
-   **dotted.func** soft.plus.func
-   **other** sOfTPluSfunc

The last style-element is line-length. For each R file, we counted the
distribution of line-length. In this analysis, the unit of analysis is
line.

If not considering line-length, the remaining 10 binary and one
multinomial leave 7,168 possible combinations of PSVs that a programmer
could employ ($7 \times 2^{10} = 7,168$).

## Methodology of community-specific variations analysis

On top of the overall patterns based on the analysis of all functions,
the community-specific variations are also studied. In this part of the
study, we ask the question: do local patterns of PSV exist in various
programming communities? To this end, we constructed a dependency graph
of CRAN packages by defining a package as a node and an import/suggest
relationship as a directed edge. Communities in this dependency graph
were extracted using the Walktrap Community Detection Algorithm [@pons]
provided by the [*igraph*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=igraph)
package [@csardi]. The step parameter was set at 4 for this analysis.
Notably, we analyzed the dependency graph as a snapshot, which is built
based on the submission history of every package from 1998 to 2019.

By applying the Walktrap Community Detection on the 2019 data, we have
identified 931 communities in this CRAN dependency graph. The purpose of
this analysis is to show the PSV in different communities. We selected
the largest 20 communities for further analysis. The choice of 20 is
deemed enough to show these community-specific variations. These 20
identified communities cover 88% of the total 14,491 packages, which
shows that the coverage of our analysis is comprehensive. Readers could
explore other choices themselves using our openly shared data.

## Methodology of within-package variations analysis

As discussed in @gillespie2016efficient, maintaining a consistent style
in source code can enable efficient reading by multiple readers; it is
even thought to be a quality of a successful R programmer. In addition
to community-level analysis, we extend our work to the package-level, in
which we investigate the consistency of different style elements within
a package. In this analysis, we studied 12 style elements, including
fx_assign, fx_commas, fx_integer, fx_semi, fx_t_f, fx_closecurly,
fx_infix, fx_opencurly, fx_singleq, fx_tab, and fx_name. In other words,
11 binary variables (the first 11) and 1 multinomial variable (fx_name)
could be assigned to each function within a package.

We quantified the package-level consistency by computing the entropy for
each style element. Given a style element S of an R package $R_{i}$,
with possible n choices $s_{1}$, $\dots$ $s_{n}$ (e.g. n = 2 for
binary; n = 7 for fx_names), the entropy $H(S)$ is calculated as:

$$\label{eqn}
H(S) = - \sum_{i = 1}^{n} P(s_{i}) \log P(s_{i})   (\#eq:eqn)$$

$P(s_{i})$ is calculated as the proportion of all functions in $R_{i}$
with the style element $s_{i}$. For example, if a package has 4
functions and the S of these 4 functions are 0,0,1,2. The entropy $H(S)$
is
$- ((0.5 \times \log 0.5) + (0.25 \times \log 0.25 ) + (0.25 \times \log 0.25)) = 0.45$.

As the value of $H(S)$ is not comparable across different S with a
different number of n, we normalize the value of $H(S)$ into $H'(S)$ by
dividing $H(S)$ with the theoretical maximum. The maximum values of
$H(S)$ for n = 2 and n = 7 are 0.693 and 1.946, respectively.

Finally, we calculate the $\overline{H'(S)}$ of all CRAN packages (i.e.
$R_{1}$ $\dots$ $R_{n}$, where n equals the number of all CRAN
packages) by averaging the $H'(S)$.

# Results

We studied more than 108 million lines of code from 17,692 unique
packages. In total, 2,249,326 exported functions were studied.
Figure [1](#figure:fig1) displays the popularity of the 10 binary
style-elements from 1998 to 2019. Some style-elements have very clear
trends towards a majority-vs-minority pattern, e.g. fx_closecurly,
fx_semi, fx_t_f and fx_tab. Some styles-elements are instead trending
towards a divergence from a previous majority-vs-minority pattern, e.g.
fx_assign, fx_commas, fx_infix, fx_integer, fx_opencurly and fx_singleq.
There are two style-elements that deserve special scrutiny. Firstly, the
variation in fx_assign is an illustrative example of the effect of
introducing a new language feature by the R Development Core Team. The
introduction of the language feature (= as assignment operator) in R 1.4
[@chambers] has coincided with the taking off in popularity of such
style-element since 2001. Up to now, around 20% of exported functions
use such style.

![Figure 1: Evolution in popularity of 10 style-elements from 1998 to
2019.](fig1.png){#figure:fig1 width="100%"
alt="graphic without alt text"}

Secondly, the popularity of fx_opencurly shows how a previously
established majority style (around 80% in late 90s) slowly reduced into
a minority, but still prominent, style (around 30% in late 10s).

Similarly, the evolution of different naming conventions is shown in
Figure [2](#figure:fig2) [^3]. This analysis can best be used to
illustrate the effect of style-guides. According to @baaaath,
dotted.func style is very specific to R programming. This style is the
most dominant style in the early days of CRAN. However, multiple style
guides advise against the use of dotted.func style and thus a
significant declining trend is observed. lower_snake and UpperCamel are
the styles endorsed by the Tidyverse Style Guide and the Google's R
Style Guide, respectively. These two styles see an increasing trend
since the 2010s, while the growth of lower_snake is stronger, with
almost a 20% growth in the share of all functions in contrast with the
1-2% growth of other naming conventions. In 2019, lower_snake (a style
endorsed by Tidyverse) is the most popular style (26.6%). lowerCamel
case, a style endorsed by Bioconductor, is currently the second most
popular naming convention (21.3% in 2019). Only 7.0% of functions use
UpperCamel, the style endorsed by Google.

![Figure 2: Evolution in popularity of 7 naming conventions from 1998 to
2019.](fig2.png){#figure:fig2 width="100%"
alt="graphic without alt text"}

The evolution of line lengths is tricky to be visualized on a 2-D
surface. We have prepared a Shiny app
(<https://github.com/chainsawriot/rstyle/tree/master/shiny>) to
visualize the change in line distribution over the span of 21 years. In
this paper, Figure [3](#figure:fig3) shows the snapshot of the change in
line length distribution in the range of 40 to 100 characters. In
general, developers of newer packages write with less characters per
line. Similar to previous analyses with Python programs e.g.@vanderplas,
artificial peaks corresponding to recommendations from either
style-guides, linters, and editor settings are also observed in our
analysis. In 2019, the artificial peak of 80 characters (recommended by
most of the style-guides and linters such as
[*lintr*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=lintr)) is more pronounced
for lines with comments but not those with actual code.

![Figure 3: Change in line length distribution of comments (orange) and
actual code (green): 2003, 2008, 2013 and 2019.](fig3.png){#figure:fig3

## Community-based variations

Using the aforementioned community detection algorithm of the dependency
graph, the largest 20 communities were extracted. These communities are
named by their applications. Table [2](#tab:table2) lists the details of
these communities [^4].

Using the naming convention as an example, there are local patterns in
PSV (Figure [4](#figure:fig4)). For example, lower_snake case is the
most popular naming convention in the \"RStudio\" community as expected
because it is the naming convention endorsed by the Tidyverse
Style-guide. However, only a few functions exported by the packages from
\"GUI: Gtk\" community uses such convention.

For the binary style-elements, local patterns are also observed
(Figure [5](#figure:fig5)). The most salient pattern is the exceptional
high usage of tab indentation in \"rJava\" and \"Bioinformatics\"
communities, probably due to influences from Java or Perl. Also,
packages in \"GUI: Gtk\" have an exceptional high usage of open curly on
its own line.

## Within-package variations

The result shows that the consistency of style elements within a package
varies (Figure [6](#figure:fig6)). For example, style elements like
fx_integer, fx_commas, fx_infix, fx_opencurly, and fx_name have less
consistency within a package than fx_tab, fx_semi, fx_t_f,
fx_closecurly, fx_singleq, and fx_assign. Based on our within-package
analysis, we noticed that it is rare for a package to use a consistent
style in all of its functions, except those packages with only a few
functions. This finding prompts previous concerns e.g. @oman
[@elish; @wang; @gillespie2016efficient] that these inconsistent style
variations within a software project (e.g. in an R package) might make
open source collaboration difficult.

elements](fig6.png){#figure:fig6 width="100%"

In Figure [7](#figure:fig7), we contextualize this finding by showing
the distribution of fx_name in 20 R packages with the highest PageRank
[@page1999pagerank] in the CRAN dependency graph. Many of these packages
have only 1 dominant naming convention (e.g. lower_snake or lowerCamel),
but not always. For instance, functions with 6 different naming
conventions can be found in the package
[*Rcpp*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=Rcpp).

# Discussion

In this study, we study the PSV in 21 years of CRAN packages across two
dimensions: 1) temporal dimension: the longitudinal changes in
popularity of various style-elements over 21 years, and 2)
cross-sectional dimension: the variations among communities of the
latest snapshot of all packages from 1998 to 2019. From our analysis, we
identify three factors that possibly drive PSV: the effect of
style-guides (trending of naming conventions endorsed by @tidyverse and
@google), the effect of introducing a new language feature (trending of
= usage as assignments after 2001), and the effect of editors (the
dominance of 80-character line limit).

From a policy recommendation standpoint, our study provides important
insight for the R Development Core Team and other stakeholders to
improve the current situation of PSV in R. First, the introduction of a
new language feature can have a very long-lasting effect on PSV.
\"Assignments with the = operator\" is a feature that introduced by the
R Development Core Team to "increase compatibility with S-Plus (as well
as with C, Java, and many other languages)" [@chambers]. This might be a
good intention but it has an unintended consequence of introducing a
very persistent PSV that two major style-guides, @tidyverse and @google,
consider as a bad style.

Second, style-guides, linters, and editors are important standardizers
of PSV. Although we have not directly measured the use of style-guides,
linters, and editors in our analysis [^5], we infer their effect by
studying the time trend (Figure [1](#figure:fig1)). Even with these
standardizers, programming styles are slow to change. As indicated by
the local PSV patterns, we found in some communities, some package
developers have their own style. Having said so, we are not accusing
those developers of not following the trendy programming styles.
Instead, they follow the mantra of "if it ain't broke don't fix it".
Again, from a policy recommendation standpoint, the existence of local
PSV patterns suggests there are many blind spots to the previous efforts
in addressing PSV. The authors of the style guides may consider
community outreach to promote their endorsed styles, if they want other
communities to adopt their styles.

Our analysis also opens up an open question: should R adopt an official
style-guide akin the PEP-8 of the Python Software Foundation
[@vanrossum]? There are of course pros and cons of adopting an official
style-guide. As written by @christiansen, "style can easily become a
religious issue." It is not our intention to meddle in this "religious
issue." If such an effort would be undertaken by someone else, the
following consensus-based style could be used as the basis. The
following is an example of a function written in such style.

``` r
softplus_func <- function(value, leaky = FALSE) {
    if (leaky) {
        warnings("using leaky RELU!")
        return(ifelse(value > 0, value, value * 0.01))
    }
    return(log(1 + exp(value)))
}
```

In essence,

-   Use snake case
-   Use \<- to assign, don't use =
-   Add a space after commas
-   Use TRUE / FALSE, don't use T / F
-   Put open curly bracket on same line then a newline
-   Use double quotation mark for strings
-   Add spaces around infix operators
-   Don't terminate lines with semicolon
-   Don't explicitly type integers (i.e. 1L)
-   Put close curly bracket on its own line
-   Don't use tab to indent

We must stress here that this *consensus-based* style is only the most
popular style based on our analysis, i.e. the *Zeitgeist* (the spirit of
the age) [^6]. We have no guarantee that this style can improve clarity
or comprehensibility. As a final remark: although enforcing a consistent
style can improve open source collaboration [@wang], one must also bear
in mind that these rules might need to be adjusted sometimes to cater
for programmers with special needs. For example, using spaces instead of
tabs for indentation can make code inaccessible to visually impaired
programmers [@mosal].

    the 3 style guides of Tidyverse, Google and Bioconductor is because
    these 3 are arguably the most influential. There are groups of
    developers (e.g. contributors to
    [*tidyverse*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=tidyverse), Google
    employees, and Bioconductor contributors) adhering to these 3
    styles.

    analysis, please refer to the README file in our Github repository:
    <https://github.com/chainsawriot/rstyle>

[^3]: 'Other' is the 4th most popular naming convention. Some examples
    of function names classified as 'other' are: *Blanc-Sablon*,
    *returnMessage.maxim*, *table_articles_byAuth*, *mktTime.market*,
    *smoothed_EM*, *plot.Sncf2D*, *as.igraph.EPOCG*, *TimeMap.new*,
    *fT.KB*, *IDA_stable*. These functions were classified as 'other'
    because of the placement of capital letters. For packages using an
    all capitals object class name (e.g. EPOCG) and S3 generic method
    names (e.g. as.igraph), their methods are likely to be classified as
    'others'. One could also classify these functions as dotted.func.
    However, we follow both
    [*lintr*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=lintr) and @baaaath to
    classify a function as dotted.func only when no capital letter is
    used in its name.

[^4]: "Base packages" (core packages come with R) such as
    [*methods*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=methods) and
    [*utils*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=utils) were included in
    the dependency graph. However, the PSV of recommended packages were
    not analyzed.

[^5]: The usage of style-guides, linters, and editors cannot be directly
    measured from the record on CRAN. The maintainers usually do not
    explicitly state the style-guide they endorsed in their code.
    Similarly, packages that have been processed with linters do not
    import or suggest linters such as
    [*lintr*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=lintr),
    [*styler*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=styler) or
    [*goodpractice*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=goodpractice).
    It might be possible to infer the use of a specific editor such as
    RStudio in the development version of a package with signals such as
    the inclusion of an RStudio Project file. These signals, however,
    were usually removed in the CRAN submission of the package. Future
    research should use alternative methods to measure the usage of
    these 3 things in R packages. In this study, similar to other
    studies, e.g. @bafatakis:2019:PCS, we use style compliance as a
    proxy to usage of a particular style guide, linter or editor.

[^6]: In 2019, 5.35% of all functions are in this *Zeitgeist* style.
    Using electoral system as an analogy, this style is having the
    plurality (have the highest number of votes) but not the absolute
    majority (have over 50% of the votes)
