title: 'VSURF: An R Package for Variable Selection Using Random Forests'
abstract: This paper describes the R package *VSURF*. Based on random forests, and
  for both regression and classification problems, it returns two subsets of variables.
  The first is a subset of important variables including some redundancy which can
  be relevant for interpretation, and the second one is a smaller subset corresponding
  to a model trying to avoid redundancy focusing more closely on the prediction objective.
  The two-stage strategy is based on a preliminary ranking of the explanatory variables
  using the random forests permutation-based score of importance and proceeds using
  a stepwise forward strategy for variable introduction. The two proposals can be
  obtained automatically using data-driven default values, good enough to provide
  interesting results, but strategy can also be tuned by the user. The algorithm is
  illustrated on a simulated example and its applications to real datasets are presented.

# Introduction

Variable selection is a crucial issue in many applied classification and
regression problems [see e.g.Â  @Hastie01]. It is of interest for
statistical analysis as well as for modelisation or prediction purposes
to remove irrelevant variables, to select all important ones or to
determine a sufficient subset for prediction. These main different
objectives from a statistical learning perspective involve variable
selection to simplify statistical problems, to help diagnosis and
interpretation, and to speed up data processing.

@Gen10 proposed a variable selection method based on random forests
[@Breiman01], and the aim of this paper is to describe the associated R
package called [*VSURF*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=VSURF) and
to illustrate its use on real datasets. The stable version of the
package is available from the Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN) at
<http://CRAN.R-project.org/package=VSURF>.[^1] In order to make the
paper self-contained, the description of the variable selection method
is provided. A simulated toy example and a classical real dataset are
processed using *VSURF*. In addition, two real examples in a
high-dimensional setting, not previously addressed by the authors, are
used to illustrate the value of the strategy and the effectiveness of
the R package.

Introduced by @Breiman01, random forests (abbreviated RF in the sequel)
are an attractive nonparametric statistical method to deal with these
problems, since they require only mild conditions on the model supposed
to have generated the observed data. Indeed, since RF are based on
decision trees and use aggregation ideas, they allow us to consider in
an elegant and versatile framework different models and problems, namely
regression, two-class and multiclass classifications.

Considering a learning set $L=\{(X_1,Y_1),\ldots,(X_n,Y_n)\}$, supposed
to consist of independent observations of the random vector $(X,Y)$, we
distinguish as usual the predictors (or explanatory variables),
collected in the vector $X=(X^1,\ldots,X^p)$ where $X\in\mathbb{R}^p$,
from the explained variable $Y\in\mathcal{Y}$ where $Y$ is either a
class label for classification problems or a numerical response for
regression ones. Let us recall that a classifier $t$ is a mapping
$t:\mathbb{R}^p\rightarrow \mathcal{Y}$ while the regression function
naturally corresponds to the function $s$ when we suppose that
$Y = s(X) + \varepsilon$ with $E[\varepsilon|X]=0$. Then random forests
provide estimators of either the Bayes classifier, which minimizes the
classification error $P(Y \neq t(X))$, or the regression function.

The CART (Classification and Regression Trees) method defined by
@Breiman84 is a well-known way to design optimal single binary decision
trees. It proceeds by performing first a growing step and then a pruning
one. The principle of random forests is to aggregate many binary
decision trees coming from two random perturbation mechanisms: the use
of bootstrap samples of $L$ instead of $L$ and the random choice of a
subset of explanatory variables at each node instead of all of them.
There are two main differences with respect to CART trees: first, in the
growing step, at each node, a fixed number of input variables are
randomly chosen and the best split is calculated only among them and,
second, no pruning step is performed so all the trees of the forest are
maximal trees. The RF algorithm is a very popular machine learning
algorithm and appears to be powerful in a lot of different applications,
see for example @Verikas11 and @Boulesteix12 for recent surveys.

Several implementations of these methods are available. Focusing on R
packages we must mention
[*rpart*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=rpart) [@Therneau13] for
CART, [*randomForest*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=randomForest)
[@Liaw02] for RF, [*party*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=party)
[@Hothorn06] for CART and RF (through the function `cforest`) and
[*ipred*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=ipred) [@Peters02] for
bagging [@Breiman96], a closely related method cited here for the sake
of completeness. In this paper, we use the *randomForest* procedure,
which is based on the initial contribution of @BreiCutl04. We will
concentrate on the prediction performance of RF focusing on the
out-of-bag (OOB) error [see @Breiman01] and on the quantification of the
variable importance (VI in the sequel) which are key ingredients for our
variable selection strategy. For a general discussion about variable
importance, see @Aze03. In the random forests framework, one of the most
widely used scores of importance of a given variable is the increase in
mean of the error of a tree (mean square error (MSE) for regression and
misclassification rate for classification) in the forest when the
observed values of this variable are randomly permuted in the OOB
samples [see @Archer08].

@Str07 showed that VI scores are biased towards correlated variables,
and @Strobl08 proposed an alternative permutation scheme as a solution,
which, however, increases the computation cost. This seems to be
especially critical for high-dimensional problems with strongly
correlated predictors. Nevertheless, our previous experiments [@Gen10]
on variable selection and, more recently, the theoretical study of
@Gre13 show that, in some situations, the VI scores are biased towards
uncorrelated variables. Additional theoretical results and experiments
are needed to more deeply understand these phenomenons, but this is out
of the scope of the paper.

A lot of variable selection procedures are based on the combination of
variable importance for ranking and model estimation to generate,
evaluate and compare a family of models, i.e., in particular in the
family of "wrapper" methods [@Kohavi97; @Guyon03] which include the
prediction performance in the score calculation, for which a lot of
methods can be cited. We choose to highlight one of them which is widely
used and close to our procedure. @Diaz06 propose a strategy based on
recursive elimination of variables. At the beginning, they compute RF
variable importance and then, at each step, eliminate iteratively the
$20\%$ of the variables having the smallest importance and build a new
forest with the remaining variables. The final set of variables is
selected by minimizing over the obtained forests, the OOB error rate
defined by: $$\mathit{errOOB} =
\begin{cases}
\frac{1}{n} \mathrm{Card} \left\{ i \in \{ 1,\ldots,n \} \: | \: y_i \neq \hat{y_i} \right\} & {\text{in the classification framework}} \\
\frac{1}{n} \sum_{ i\in \{ 1,\ldots,n \} } \left(y_i - \hat{y_i} \right)^2 & {\text{in the regression framework}}
\end{cases}$$ where $\hat{y_i}$ is the aggregation of the predicted
values by trees $t$ for which $(x_i,y_i)$ belongs to the associated
$\mathit{OOB}$ sample (data not included in the bootstrap sample used to
construct $t$). The proportion of variables to eliminate is an arbitrary
parameter of their method and does not depend on the data. Let us remark
that we propose an heuristic strategy which does not depend on specific
model hypotheses, but which is based on data-driven thresholds to take
decisions.

This topic of variable selection still continues to be of interest.
Indeed recently @Hapfelmeier2013 propose a new variable selection
approach using random forests and, more generally, @Cadenas13 describe
and compare different approaches in a survey paper.

Some packages are available to cope with variable selection problems.
Let us cite, for classification problems the R package
[*Boruta*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=Boruta), described in
@Kursa2010, which aims at finding all relevant variables using a random
forest classification algorithm which iteratively removes the variables
using a statistical test. The R package
[*varSelRF*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=varSelRF), described in
@Diaz2007, implements the previously described method for selecting very
small sets of genes in the context of classification. The R package
*ofw* [@LeCao2008], also dedicated to the context of classification,
selects relevant variables based on the application of supervised
multiclass classifiers such as CART or support vector machines. The R
package
[*spikeSlabGAM*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=spikeSlabGAM)
implements Bayesian variable selection via regularized estimation in
additive mixed models [@Scheipl2011]. Dedicated to the biomarker
identification in the life sciences, the R package
[*BioMark*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=BioMark) implements two
meta-statistics for variable selection [@Wehrens12]: the first sets a
data-dependent selection threshold for significance, which is useful
when two groups are compared, and the second, more general one, uses
repeated subsampling and selects the model coefficients remaining
consistently important.

The paper is organized as follows. After this introduction, we present
the general variable selection strategy. We then describe how to use
package *VSURF* on a simple simulated dataset. Finally, we examine three
real-life examples to illustrate the method in action in
high-dimensional situations as well as in a standard one.

# The strategy {#sec:strategy}

## Objectives

In @Gen10 we distinguished two variable selection objectives referred to
as interpretation and prediction.

Even if this distinction can be a little bit confusing since we use for
both objectives the same criterion related to prediction performance,
the idea is the following. The first objective, called interpretation,
is to find important variables highly related to the response variable,
even with some redundancy, possibly high. The second one, namely
prediction, is to find a smaller number of variables with very low
redundancy and sufficient for a good enough prediction of the response
variable. The terminology used here can be misunderstood since usually
for interpretation, one usually looks for parsimony but in many
situations one may often want to identify all predictor variables
associated with the response to interpret correctly the relation. We
thank one anonymous reviewer for raising this issue and we detail an
example in the next paragraph to clarify the difference.

A typical situation illustrates the distinction between the two kinds of
variable selection. Let us consider a high-dimensional ($n \ll p$)
classification problem for which the predictor variables are associated
to a pixel in an image or a voxel in a 3D-image as in fMRI brain
activity classification problems [see e.g.Â  @Gen10b]. In such
situations, it is supposed that a lot of variables are useless and that
there exist unknown groups of highly correlated predictors corresponding
to brain regions involved in the response to a given stimulation. The
two distinct objectives about variable selection can be of interest.
Finding all the important variables highly related to the response
variable is useful for interpretation, since it corresponds to the
determination of entire regions in the brain or a full parcel in an
image. By contrast, finding a small number of variables sufficient for
good prediction allows to get the most discriminant variables within the
previously highlighted regions. For a more formal approach to this
distinction, see also the interesting paper @Nil07.

## Principle {#sec:principle}

The principle of the two-steps algorithm is the following. First, we
rank the variables according to a variable importance measure and the
unimportant ones are eliminated. Second, we provide two different
subsets obtained either by considering a collection of nested RF models
and selecting the variables of the most accurate one, or by introducing
sequentially the sorted variables.

Since the quantification of the variable importance is crucial for our
procedure, let us recall the definition of RF variable importance. For
each tree $t$ of the forest, consider the associated $\mathit{OOB}_t$
sample (data not included in the bootstrap sample used to construct
$t$). Denote by $\mathit{errOOB}_t$ the error (MSE for regression and
misclassification rate for classification) of a single tree $t$ on this
$\mathit{OOB}_t$ sample. Now, randomly permute the values of $X^j$ in
$\mathit{OOB}_t$ to get a perturbed sample denoted by
$\widetilde{\mathit{OOB}_t}^j$ and compute
$\mathit{err}\widetilde{\mathit{OOB}_t}^j$, the error of predictor $t$
on the perturbed sample. Variable importance of $X^j$ is then equal to:
$$VI(X^j) = \frac{1}{\mathit{ntree}} \sum_{t} \left( \mathit{err}\widetilde{\mathit{OOB}_t}^j - \mathit{errOOB}_t \right),$$
where the sum is over all trees $t$ of the RF and $\mathit{ntree}$
denotes the number of trees of the RF. Notice that we use this
definition of importance and not the normalized one. Indeed, instead of
considering [as mentioned in @BreiCutl04] that the raw VI are
independent replicates, normalizing them and assuming normality of these
scores, we prefer a fully data-driven solution. This is a key point of
our strategy: we prefer to estimate directly the variability of
importance across repetitions of forests instead of using normality when
$\mathit{ntree}$ is sufficiently large, which is only valid under some
specific conditions. Those conditions are difficult to check since their
validity depends heavily on tuning parameters and problem peculiarities,
so data-driven normalization prevents some misspecified asymptotic
behavior.

Another useful argument, which provides the rationale for this kind of
variable selection procedure based on a classical stepwise method
combined with the use of a VI measure, is that a variable not included
in the underlying true model has a null "theoretical" importance. In a
recent paper @Gre13 theoretically state that, in the case of additive
models, irrelevant variables have null "theoretical" VI. A similar
result for the mean decrease impurity index (not used in this paper) has
been proven by [@louppe13].

## Detailed strategy {#sec:det_strategy}

Let us now describe more precisely our two-steps procedure. Note that
each RF is typically built using $\mathit{ntree}=2000$ trees.

-   Step 1. Preliminary elimination and ranking:

    -   Rank the variables by sorting the VI (averaged over typically
        $50$ RF runs) in descending order.

    -   Eliminate the variables of small importance (let $m$ denote the
        number of remaining variables).

        More precisely, starting from this order, consider the ordered
        sequence of the corresponding standard deviations (sd) of VI and
        use it to estimate a threshold value for VI. Since variability
        of VI is larger for true variables compared to useless ones, the
        threshold value is given by an estimation of the VI standard
        deviation of the useless variables. This threshold is set to the
        minimum prediction value given by a CART model where the $Y$ are
        the sd of the VI and the $X$ are the ranks.

        Then only the variables with an averaged VI exceeding this
        threshold are retained.

-   Step 2. Variable selection:

    -   For *interpretation*: construct the nested collection of RF
        models involving the $k$ first variables, for $k=1$ to $m$ and
        select the variables involved in the model leading to the
        smallest OOB error. This leads to consider $m^{\prime}$
        variables.

        More precisely, we compute OOB error rates of RF (averaged
        typically over $25$ runs) of the nested models starting from the
        one with only the most important variable, and ending with the
        one including all important variables previously kept. Ideally,
        the variables of the model leading to the smallest OOB error are
        selected. In fact, in order to deal with instability, we use a
        classical trick: we select the smallest model with an OOB error
        less than the minimal OOB error augmented by its standard
        deviation (based on the same $25$ runs).

    -   For *prediction*: starting with the ordered variables retained
        for interpretation, construct an ascending sequence of RF
        models, by invoking and testing the variables in a stepwise way.
        The variables of the last model are selected.

        More precisely, the sequential variable introduction is based on
        the following test: a variable is added only if the error
        decrease is larger than a threshold. The idea is that the OOB
        error decrease must be significantly greater than the average
        variation obtained by adding noisy variables. The threshold is
        set to the mean of the absolute values of the first order
        differentiated OOB errors between the model with $m^{\prime}$
        variables and the one with $m$ variables: 
        $$\label{eq:mean_jump}
         \frac{1}{m - m^{\prime}} \sum_{j=m^{\prime}}^{m-1} \left| \, \mathit{errOOB}(j+1) - \mathit{errOOB}(j), \, \right|  (\#eq:mean-jump)  $$
        where $\mathit{errOOB}(j)$ is the OOB error of the RF built
        using the $j$ most important variables.

## Comments {#sec:comments_strategy}

In addition to the detailed strategy, let us give some additional
comments. Regarding the first step of our procedure, our previous
simulation study in [@Gen10] shows that both VI level and variability
are larger for relevant variables.

We assume that the stabilized ranking performed in the first step of our
procedure will not change after the elimination step.

The use of CART to find the threshold is of course not strictly
necessary and can be replaced by many other strategies but it is
interesting in our case because the idea is typically to find a constant
on a large interval. Since CART fits a piece-wise constant function,
this desired constant is the threshold for VI and is defined as the
minimum prediction value given by a CART model fitting the curve of VI
standard deviations. It is obtained automatically by the CART strategy
whereas the user needs to select some window parameter if, for example,
a simple smoothing method is used.

Note that the threshold value is based on VI standard deviations while
the effective thresholding is performed on the VI mean. In general, this
rule is conservative and leads to keep more variables than necessary,
postponing to the next step a more parsimonious choice.

In addition, we note that several implementation choices have been made:
*randomForest* for RF fitting and VI calculation (repeated $50$ times to
quantify variability) and *rpart* for estimating the VI variability
level associated with irrelevant variables leading to a convenient
threshold value. Of course other choices would be possible, for example,
using the function `cforest` of the package *party* to implement the
same scheme of variable selection.

The next section describes the use of the package *VSURF* together with
a complete illustration of the strategy which is not supported by
specific model hypotheses but based on data-driven thresholds to take
decisions.

But before entering in this description, let us emphasize that the
objects of interest here are the subsets of important variables and not
precisely the corresponding models. Thus OOB errors from the figures (or
from the fitted objects) cannot be used or reported as the prediction
error estimation of the final model because this would need a proper
cross-validation scheme.

# Using the package *VSURF* {#sec:package}

## From data to final results {#sec:from-data-final}

We illustrate the use of the *VSURF* package on a simple simulated
moderately high-dimensional dataset ($n=100 < p=200$) called `toys`
data, introduced by @Weston03. It comes from an equiprobable two-class
problem, $Y\in\{-1,1\}$, with $6$ influential variables and with the
others being noise variables. Let us define the simulation model by
giving the conditional distribution of the $X^i$ for $Y=y$:

-   For the six first variables: with probability 0.7,
    $X^i\sim \mathcal{N}(y i,1)$ for $i=1,2,3$ and
    $X^i\sim \mathcal{N}(0,1)$ for $i=4,5,6$; with probability 0.3,
    $X^i\sim \mathcal{N}(0,1)$ for $i=1,2,3$ and
    $X^i\sim \mathcal{N} \left( y(i-3),1 \right)$ for $i=4,5,6$.

-   The remaining variables are noise: $X^i\sim \mathcal{N}(0,1)$ for
    $i=7,\ldots,p$.

The variables obtained in the simulation are standardized before further
analysis.

First, we load the *VSURF* package and the `toys` data (and fix the
random number generation seed for reproducibility):

``` r
> library("VSURF")
> data("toys")
> set.seed(3101318)
```

The standard way to use the *VSURF* package is to use the `VSURF`
function. This function executes the complete procedure, and is just a
wrapper for the three intermediate functions `VSURF_thres`,
`VSURF_interp` and `VSURF_pred` which are described in the next section.
Typical use of the `VSURF` function is as follows:

``` r
> toys.vsurf <- VSURF(x = toys$x, y = toys$y, mtry = 100)
```

The only mandatory inputs are `x`, an object containing input variables,
and `y`, the output variable.

In this example, we also choose a specific value for `mtry` (default is
$p/3$ for classification and regression problems in `VSURF`), which only
affects RF runs in the first step of the procedure. In addition, we
stress that the default value for `ntree` is $2000$ in `VSURF`. Those
values were considered as well adapted for VI calculations [see @Gen10
SectionÂ 2.2] and these two arguments are passed to the `randomForest`
function (we kept the same name for consistency).

The function outputs a list containing all results.

``` r
> names(toys.vsurf)
```

``` r
 [1] "varselect.thres"     "varselect.interp"    "varselect.pred"     
 [4] "nums.varselect"      "imp.varselect.thres" "min.thres"          
 [7] "imp.mean.dec"        "imp.mean.dec.ind"    "imp.sd.dec"         
[10] "mean.perf"           "pred.pruned.tree"    "err.interp"         
[13] "sd.min"              "err.pred"            "mean.jump"          
[16] "nmin"                "nsd"                 "nmj"                
[19] "overall.time"        "comput.times"        "ncores"             
[22] "clusterType"         "call"               
```

The most important objects are `varselect.thres`, `varselect.interp` and
`varselect.pred`, which contain the set of variables selected after the
thresholding, interpretation and prediction step respectively.

The `summary` method gives a short summary of the results: numbers of
selected variables and computation times.

``` r
> summary(toys.vsurf)
```

``` r
 VSURF computation time: 1.6 mins 

 VSURF selected: 
	36 variables at thresholding step (in 57.6 secs)
	4 variables at interpretation step (in 38.4 secs)
	3 variables at prediction step (in 2.2 secs)
```

The `plot` method gives a plot (see FigureÂ [1](#fig:toys.VSURF.plot)) of
the results in $4$ graphs. To selectively obtain single graphs of
FigureÂ [1](#fig:toys.VSURF.plot) one can either suitably specify the
arguments of this `plot` method, or use intermediate `plot` methods
(associated with each procedure step) included in the package.

``` r
> plot(toys.vsurf)
```

![Figure 1: []{#fig:toys.VSURF.plot label="fig:toys.VSURF.plot"} `VSURF`
for the `toys` data: Top graphs illustrate the thresholding step, bottom
left and bottom right graphs are associated with interpretation and
prediction steps
respectively.](figure/fig-toysVSURFplot.png){#fig:toys.VSURF.plot
width="100%" alt="graphic without alt text"}

In addition, we include a `predict` method, which permits to predict the
outcomes for new data with RF using only the variables selected by
`VSURF`.

Finally, we point out that all computations of the package can be
executed in parallel, whenever it is possible. For example, the
following command runs `VSURF` in parallel on a Linux computing server
using 40 cores:

``` r
> set.seed(2734, kind = "L'Ecuyer-CMRG")
> toys.vsurf.parallel <- VSURF(toys$x, toys$y, mtry = 100, parallel = TRUE,
+                              ncores = 40, clusterType = "FORK")
```

``` r
> summary(toys.vsurf.parallel)
```

``` r
 VSURF computation time: 8.3 secs 

 VSURF selected: 
	35 variables at thresholding step (in 3.8 secs)
	4 variables at interpretation step (in 2.3 secs)
	3 variables at prediction step (in 2.2 secs)

 VSURF ran in parallel on a FORK cluster and used 40 cores 
```

Note that we use the `"LâEcuyer-CMRG"` kind in the `set.seed` function
to allow reproducibility (when the call is on a `FORK` cluster with the
same number of cores). Even if one should have a computing server with
40 cores to benefit from this execution time reduction, the resulting
'`VSURF`' object from this call will be the same on a computer with
fewer cores available. Parallel calls of `VSURF` will be used to deal
with the two high-dimensional datasets at the end of the paper.

## How to get intermediate results {#sec:how-get-intermediate}

Let us now detail the main stages of the procedure together with the
results obtained on the `toys` data. Note that unless explicitly stated
otherwise, all graphs refer to FigureÂ [1](#fig:toys.VSURF.plot).

-   Step 1.

    -   Variable ranking.

        The result of variable ranking is drawn on the top left graph.
        True variables are significantly more important than the noisy
        ones.

    -   Variable elimination.

        Starting from this order, the plot of the corresponding standard
        deviations of VI is used to estimate a threshold value for VI.
        This threshold (figured by the dotted horizontal red line in
        FigureÂ [2](#fig:toys.VSURF.plot.thres), which is a zoom of the
        top right graph of FigureÂ [1](#fig:toys.VSURF.plot)) is set to
        the minimum prediction value given by a CART model fitting this
        curve (see the green piece-wise constant function on the same
        graph).

        Then only the variables with an averaged VI exceeding this level
        (i.e.Â above the horizontal red line in the top left graph of
        FiguresÂ [1](#fig:toys.VSURF.plot)) are retained.

        The computation of the $50$ forests, the ranking and elimination
        steps are obtained with the `VSURF_thres` function:

        ``` r
        > set.seed(3101318)
        > toys.thres <- VSURF_thres(toys$x, toys$y, mtry = 100)
        ```

        The `VSURF_thres` function outputs a list containing all results
        of this step. The main outputs are: `varselect.thres` which
        contains the indices of variables selected by this step,
        `imp.mean.dec` and `imp.sd.dec` which hold the VI mean and
        standard deviation (the order according to decreasing VI mean
        can be found in `imp.mean.dec.ind`).

        ``` r
        > toys.thres$varselect.thres
        ```

        ``` r
         [1]   3   2   6   5   1   4 184  37 138 159  81  17 180 131  52 191
        [17]  96 192 165  94 198  25  21 109  64  12  29 188 107 157  70  46
        [33]  54 143 186 111
        ```

        Finally, FigureÂ [2](#fig:toys.VSURF.plot.thres) can be obtained
        with the following command:

        ``` r
        > plot(toys.vsurf, step = "thres", imp.mean = FALSE, ylim = c(0, 2e-4))
        ```

        ![Figure 2: []{#fig:toys.VSURF.plot.thres
        label="fig:toys.VSURF.plot.thres"}Zoom of the top right graph of
        FigureÂ [1](#fig:toys.VSURF.plot).](figure/fig-toysVSURFplotthres.png){#fig:toys.VSURF.plot.thres
        width="100%" alt="graphic without alt text"}

        We can see in the plot of the VI standard deviations (top right
        graph of FigureÂ [1](#fig:toys.VSURF.plot)) that the true
        variables' standard deviations are large compared to those of
        the noisy variables, which are close to zero.

-   Step 2.

    -   Variable selection procedure for interpretation.

        We use `VSURF_interp` for this step. Note that we have to
        specify the indices of variables selected at the previous step.
        So we set argument `vars` to `toys.thres$varselect.thres`:

        ``` r
        > toys.interp <- VSURF_interp(toys$x, toys$y,
        +                             vars = toys.thres$varselect.thres)
        ```

        The list resulting from the `VSURF_interp` function mainly
        contains `varselect.interp`: the variables selected by this
        step, and `err.interp`: OOB error rates of RF nested models.

        ``` r
        > toys.interp$varselect.interp
        ```

        ``` r
        [1] 3 2 6 5
        ```

        In the bottom left graph, we see that the error decreases
        quickly. It reaches its (almost) minimum when the first four
        true variables are included in the model (see the vertical red
        line) and then it remains nearly constant. The selected model
        contains variables V3, V2, V6, V5, which are four of the six
        true variables, while the actual minimum is reached for $35$
        variables.

        Note that, to ensure quality of OOB error estimations [e.g.Â 
        @Gen08 Section 2] along embedded RF models, the `mtry` parameter
        of the `randomForest` function is here set to its default value
        if $k$ (the number of variables involved in the current RF
        model) is not greater than $n$, while it is set to $k/3$
        otherwise.

    -   Variable selection procedure for prediction.

        We use the `VSURF_pred` function for this step. We need to
        specify the error rates and the variables selected in the
        interpretation step in the `err.interp` and `varselect.interp`
        arguments:

        ``` r
        > toys.pred <- VSURF_pred(toys$x, toys$y,
        +                         err.interp = toys.interp$err.interp,
        +                         varselect.interp = toys.interp$varselect.interp)
        ```

        The main outputs of the `VSURF_pred` function are the variables
        selected by this final step, `varselect.pred`, and the OOB error
        rates of RF models, `err.pred`.

        ``` r
        > toys.pred$varselect.pred
        ```

        ``` r
        [1] 3 6 5
        ```

        For the `toys` data, the final model for prediction purpose
        involves only variables V3, V6, V5 (see the bottom right graph).
        The threshold is set to the mean of the absolute values of the
        first order differentiated OOB errors between the model with
        $m^{\prime}=4$ variables and the one with $m=36$ variables.

Finally, we mention that `VSURF_thres` and `VSURF_interp` can be
executed in parallel with the same syntax as `VSURF` (setting
`parallel = TRUE`), while `VSURF_pred` cannot be parallelized.

## Tuning the different steps of the procedure {#sec:tuning}

We provide two additional functions for tuning the thresholding and
interpretation steps without having to rerun all computations.

-   First, a `tune` method which, applied to the result of
    `VSURF_thres`, can be used to tune the thresholding step. We can use
    the `nmin` parameter (which has default value $1$) in order to set
    the threshold to the minimum prediction value given by the CART
    model times `nmin`.

    ``` r
    > toys.thres.tuned <- tune(toys.thres, nmin = 3)
    > toys.thres.tuned$varselect.thres
    ```

    ``` r
     [1]   3   2   6   5   1   4 184  37 138 159  81  17 180 131  52 191
    ```

    We get $16$ selected variables instead of $36$ previously.

-   Secondly, a `tune` method which, applied to the result of
    `VSURF_interp`, is of the same kind and allows to tune the
    interpretation step. If we now want to be more restrictive in our
    selection in the interpretation step, we can select the smallest
    model with an OOB error less than the minimal OOB error augmented by
    its empirical standard deviation times `nsd` (with `nsd` $\geq 1$).

    ``` r
    > toys.interp.tuned <- tune(toys.interp, nsd = 5)
    > toys.interp.tuned$varselect.interp
    ```

    ``` r
    [1] 3 2 6
    ```

    We get $3$ selected variables instead of $4$ previously.

We did not write a tuning method for the prediction step because it is a
recursive step and needs to recompute the sequence. Hence, to adjust the
parameter for this step, we have to rerun the `VSURF_pred` function with
a different value of `nmj` (which has default value $1$). This
multiplicative constant allows to modulate the threshold defined in
(\@ref(eq:mean-jump)).

For example, increasing the value of `nmj` leads to selection of fewer
variables:

``` r
> toys.pred.tuned <- VSURF_pred(toys$x, toys$y, err.interp = toys.interp$err.interp,
+                               varselect.interp = toys.interp$varselect.interp, 
+                               nmj = 70)
> toys.pred.tuned$varselect.pred
```

``` r
[1] 3 6
```

**Remark**

Thanks to one of the three anonymous reviewers, we would like to give a
warning following a remark made by [@svetnik2004]. Indeed, this work
considers a situation where there is no link between $X$ and $Y$ and for
which they use OOB errors in a recursive strategy, different but not too
far from our procedure, to select variables. Their results show that
this kind of strategy can be seriously biased and can overfit the data.
To illustrate explicitly this phenomenon, let us start with the original
dataset `toys` for which our procedure performs quite well [see the
paper @Gen10 containing an extensive study of the operating
characteristics of the algorithm including no overfitting in presence of
many additional dummy variables]. Then, modify it by scrambling the $Y$
values thus removing the link between $X$ and $Y$. Applying `VSURF` on
this modified dataset leads to an OOB error rate, in the interpretation
step, starting from $50\%$ (which is correct) and exhibiting a minimum
for 10 variables corresponding to $37\%$. So, in this situation for
which there is no optimal solution and the desirable behavior is to find
a constant OOB error rate along the sequence, the procedure still
provides a solution. So, the conclusion is that even when there is no
link between $X$ and $Y$ the procedure can highlight a set of variables.

Of course, using an external 5-fold cross-validation of our entire
procedure leads to the correct estimate of $51\%$ error rate for both
interpretation and prediction steps and the correct conclusion: there is
nothing to find in the data. Alternatively, if we simulate a second
sample coming from the same simulation model and use it only to rank the
variables, the interpretation step exhibits an OOB error rate curve
oscillating around $50\%$, which leads to the correct conclusion.

# Three illustrative examples {#sec:examples}

In this section we apply the proposed procedure on three real-life
examples: two high-dimensional datasets (associated with a regression
problem and a classification one respectively) and, before that, a
standard one to illustrate the versatility of the procedure.

Let us mention that the `VSURF` stability is a natural issue to
investigate [see e.g.Â  @Mei10] and is considered in [@Gen10] Sections 3
and 4.

## Ozone data

The `Ozone` dataset consists of $n=366$ observations for 12 independent
variables and 1 dependent variable. These variables are numbered as in
the R package [*mlbench*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=mlbench)
[@Leisch10]: 1 -- Month, 2 -- Day of month, 3 -- Day of week, 5 --
Pressure height, 6 -- Wind speed, 7 -- Humidity, 8 -- Temperature
(Sandburg), 9 -- Temperature (El Monte), 10 -- Inversion base height, 11
-- Pressure gradient, 12 -- Inversion base temperature, 13 --
Visibility, for independent variables and 4 -- Daily maximum
one-hour-average ozone, for the dependent variable.

What makes the use of this dataset interesting, is that it has already
been extensively studied and that even though it is a real one, it is
possible to a priori know which variables are expected to be important.
Moreover, this dataset, which is not a high-dimensional one, includes
some missing data, allowing us to give an example of how to handle such
data using *VSURF*.

To begin, we load the data:

``` r
> data("Ozone", package = "mlbench")
> set.seed(221921186)
```

Then, we apply the complete procedure via `VSURF`. Note that the
following formula-type call is necessary to handle missing values (as in
`randomForest`).

``` r
> vozone <- VSURF(V4 ~ ., data = Ozone, na.action = na.omit)
> summary(vozone)
```

``` r
 VSURF computation time: 1.7 mins 

 VSURF selected: 
	9 variables at thresholding step (in 1.1 mins)
	5 variables at interpretation step (in 26.3 secs)
	5 variables at prediction step (in 12.4 secs)
```

In the first step, we look at the variable importance associated with
each of the explanatory variables.

``` r
> plot(vozone, step = "thres", imp.sd = FALSE, var.names = TRUE)
```

![Figure 3: []{#fig:ozone.plot label="fig:ozone.plot"} Sorted VI mean
associated with the 12 explanatory variables of the `Ozone` data, with
variable names on the
$x$-axis.](figure/fig-ozoneplot.png){#fig:ozone.plot width="100%" alt="graphic without alt text"}

In FigureÂ [3](#fig:ozone.plot), and as noticed in previous studies,
three very sensible groups of variables can be discerned ranging from
the most to the least important. The first group contains the two
temperatures (8 and 9), the inversion base temperature (12) known to be
the best ozone predictors, and the month (1), which is an important
predictor since ozone concentration exhibits an heavy seasonal
component. The second group of clearly less important meteorological
variables consists of: pressure height (5), humidity (7), inversion base
height (10), pressure gradient (11) and visibility (13). Finally the
last group contains three unimportant variables: day of month (2), day
of week (3) of course and more surprisingly wind speed (6). This last
fact is classical: wind enters in the model only when ozone pollution
arises, otherwise wind and pollution are weakly correlated [see for
example @Cheze03 who highlight this phenomenon using partial
estimators].

Let us now examine the results of the selection procedures. To reflect
the order used in the definition of the variables, we reorder the output
variables of the procedure.

``` r
> number <- c(1:3, 5:13)
> number[vozone$varselect.thres]
```

``` r
[1]  9  8 12  1 11  5 10  7 13
```

After the first elimination step, the 3 variables of negative importance
(variables 6, 3 and 2) are eliminated, as expected.

``` r
> number[vozone$varselect.interp]
```

``` r
[1]  9  8 12  1 11
```

Then the interpretation procedure leads to select the model with 5
variables, which contains all of the most important variables.

``` r
> number[vozone$varselect.pred]
```

``` r
[1]  9  8 12  1 11
```

With the default settings, the prediction step does not remove any
additional variable.

**Remark**

Even though the comparison with other variable selection strategies is
out of the scope of the paper, one of the three anonymous reviewers has
kindly compared the results of the *VSURF* package with the results of
the R package *Boruta*, described in @Kursa2010, on the two datasets
`toys` and `Ozone`.

Let us recall that this module directly aims at selecting all-relevant
features. Hence the comparison with the interpretation set delivered by
*VSURF* is of interest. In the `toys` dataset, the number of truly
relevant variables is 6. *VSURF* finds 4 out of 6 variables in the
interpretation stage while *Boruta* finds all six truly relevant
variables and one more false positive variable. In the case of the
`Ozone` data set *VSURF* finds 5 variables in the interpretation stage,
while *Boruta* finds 9. So, this seems to confirm that the heuristic
proposed by *VSURF* is prediction oriented (the price to pay is a risk
of false negatives) and suggests that the strategy proposed by *Boruta*
is more accurate to recover weak redundant correlations between
predictors and decision variable (the price to pay seems to be a risk of
false positives).

In fact our strategy assumes more or less that there are unnecessary
variables in the set of all available variables initially, which is not
really the case in the `Ozone` dataset. However, it is the case in the
following two high-dimensional examples.

## Toxicity data

This second dataset is also a regression framework, however, unlike
before, this case is a high-dimensional problem. The `liver.toxicity`
dataset, available in the R package
[*mixOmics*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=mixOmics) [@Dejean13],
is a real dataset from a study by @Heinloth04. In this study, 4 male
rats of the inbred strain Fisher 344 were exposed to different doses of
acetaminophen (non toxic dose (50 or 150 mg/kg), moderate toxic dose
(1500 mg/kg), severe toxic dose (2000 mg/kg)) in a controlled
experiment. Necropsies were performed at different hours after exposure
(6, 18, 24 and 48 hours) and the mRNA from the liver was extracted. In
the original study, 10 clinical chemistry variables containing markers
for the liver injury were measured. Those variables are numerical
variables since they measure the serum enzymes level. For our analysis,
the dataset extracted from this study contains:

-   a data frame, called `gene`, with 64 rows representing the subjects
    and 3116 columns representing explanatory variables which are the
    gene expression levels after normalization and preprocessing due to
    @Bushel07,

-   a vector, called `clinic`, with 64 rows and 1 column, one of the 10
    clinical variables for the same 64 subjects: more precisely, the
    variable named `ALB.g.dL.`, which corresponds to the albumin level
    and which is the one considered in [@Gonzalez2012].

As in previous studies [@Gidskehaug07; @LeCao2008b], our aim is, using
*VSURF*, to predict our clinical variable by the genes.

First, we load the data as follows:

``` r
> data("liver.toxicity", package = "mixOmics")
> clinic <- liver.toxicity$clinic$ALB.g.dL.
> set.seed(7162013, "L'Ecuyer-CMRG")
```

Now we apply our procedure and analyze the results.

``` r
> vtoxicity <- VSURF(liver.toxicity$gene, clinic, parallel = TRUE, ncores = 40,
+                    clusterType = "FORK")
```

``` r
> summary(vtoxicity)
```

``` r
 VSURF computation time: 5.9 mins 

 VSURF selected: 
	550 variables at thresholding step (in 1.1 mins)
	5 variables at interpretation step (in 4.8 mins)
	5 variables at prediction step (in 3.4 secs)

 VSURF ran in parallel on a FORK cluster and used 40 cores 
```

We notice that after the elimination step, only 550 variables remain,
thus the number of variables has been reduced by a factor of six. This
ratio is not surprising since we know that there exists extreme
redundancy in the gene expression data together with a lot of irrelevant
variables.

``` r
> plot(vtoxicity)
```

![Figure 4: []{#fig:toxicity.plot label="fig:toxicity.plot"} `VSURF` for
the `toxicity` data.](figure/fig-toxicityplot.png){#fig:toxicity.plot
width="100%" alt="graphic without alt text"}

By considering the top left graph of FigureÂ [4](#fig:toxicity.plot), it
seems quite obvious to keep just a few variables. Indeed, the procedure
leads to $5$ variables, after both interpretation and prediction steps.
Even if the numbers of selected variables are very small, they are not
surprisingly low if we refer to the study in @Gonzalez2012, where $12$
variables were selected. It would be noted that, in general, our method
failed to deliver all the variables related to the response variable in
the case of numerous strongly correlated predictors. In addition, we do
not select the same genes but our set of selected variables and the one
in @Gonzalez2012 exhibit strong correlations.

Even if the results are quite similar, an advantage of using `VSURF` is
that this procedure does not involve tuning parameters unlike the
procedure developed in @Gonzalez2012. This difference is the main reason
for the gap in computation time: several minutes with 40 cores for
`VSURF` compared to several minutes with 1 core for @Gonzalez2012.

## SRBCT data

The dataset we consider here will allow us to apply our procedure in a
classification framework. The real classification dataset is a small
version of the small round blue cell tumors of childhood data and
contains the expression measure of genes measured on $63$ samples. This
set is composed of:

-   a data frame, called `gene`, of size 63 $\times$ 2308 which contains
    the 2308 gene expressions;

-   a response factor of length 63, called `class`, indicating the class
    of each sample (4 classes in total).

These data, presented in details in @khan:2001, available in the R
package *mixOmics*, have been widely studied but in most cases only 200
genes were considered and data have been transformed to reduce the
problem to a regression problem [see e.g.Â  @LeCao2008]. As in @Diaz06,
we consider the 2308 genes and we deal directly with the classification
problem, using *VSURF*.

``` r
> data("srbct", package = "mixOmics")
> set.seed(10131419, "L'Ecuyer-CMRG")
> vSRBCT <- VSURF(srbct$gene, srbct$class, parallel = TRUE, ncores = 40,
+                 clusterType = "FORK")
```

``` r
> summary(vSRBCT)
```

``` r
 VSURF computation time: 3.6 mins 

 VSURF selected: 
	676 variables at thresholding step (in 22.6 secs)
	25 variables at interpretation step (in 3 mins)
	13 variables at prediction step (in 13.6 secs)

 VSURF ran in parallel on a FORK cluster and used 40 cores 
```

On this dataset, the procedure leads to $25$ and $13$ selected variables
after the interpretation and prediction step respectively, and the
selected variable sets are stable.

We can compare these results with those obtained in @Diaz06 where the
authors select 22 genes on the original dataset and their number of
selected variables is quite stable.

To get an idea of the performance of our procedure on the dataset, we
perform an error rate estimation using an external 5-fold
cross-validation scheme (meaning that we apply `VSURF` on each fold of
the cross-validation). We obtain the following error rates[^2] for
interpretation and prediction sets respectively:

``` r
    interp       pred 
0.01587302 0.07936508 
```

The comparison with error rates evaluated using 200 bootstrap samples in
@Diaz06 suggests that our selections are reasonable.
