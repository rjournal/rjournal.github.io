title: 'VSURF: An R Package for Variable Selection Using Random Forests'
abstract: This paper describes the R package VSURF. Based on random forests, and for
  both regression and classification problems, it returns two subsets of variables.
  The first is a subset of important variables including some redundancy which can
  be relevant for interpretation, and the second one is a smaller subset corresponding
  to a model trying to avoid redundancy focusing more closely on the prediction objective.
  The two-stage strategy is based on a preliminary ranking of the explanatory variables
  using the random forests permutation-based score of importance and proceeds using
  a stepwise forward strategy for variable introduction. The two proposals can be
  obtained automatically using data-driven default values, good enough to provide
  interesting results, but strategy can also be tuned by the user. The algorithm is
  illustrated on a simulated example and its applications to real datasets are presented.
