title: 'Unified ROC Curve Estimator for Diagnosis and Prognosis Studies: The sMSROC
  Package'
abstract: The binary classification problem is a hot topic in Statistics. Its close
  relationship with the diagnosis and the prognosis of diseases makes it crucial in
  biomedical research. In this context, it is important to identify biomarkers that
  may help to classify individuals into different classes, for example, diseased vs.
  not diseased. The Receiver Operating-Characteristic (ROC) curve is a graphical tool
  commonly used to assess the accuracy of such classification. Given the diverse nature
  of diagnosis and prognosis problems, the ROC curve estimation has been tackled from
  separate perspectives in each setting. The Two-stages Mixed-Subjects (sMS) ROC curve
  estimator fits both scenarios. Besides, it can handle data with missing or incomplete
  outcome values. This paper introduces the [R](R){.uri} package sMSROC which implements
  the sMS ROC estimator, and includes tools that may support researchers in their
  decision making. Its practical application is illustrated on three real-world datasets.
