title: 'atable: Create Tables for Clinical Trial Reports'
abstract: Examining distributions of variables is the first step in the analysis of
  a clinical trial before more specific modelling can begin. Reporting these results
  to stakeholders of the trial is an essential part of a statistician’s work. The
  atable package facilitates these steps by offering easy-to-use but still flexible
  functions.
