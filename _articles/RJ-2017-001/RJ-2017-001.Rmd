title: 'iotools: High-Performance I/O Tools for R'
abstract: The iotools package provides a set of tools for input and output intensive
  data processing in R. The functions chunk.apply and read.chunk are supplied to allow
  for iteratively loading contiguous blocks of data into memory as raw vectors. These
  raw vectors can then be efficiently converted into matrices and data frames with
  the iotools functions mstrsplit and dstrsplit. These functions minimize copying
  of data and avoid the use of intermediate strings in order to drastically improve
  performance. Finally, we also provide read.csv.raw to allow users to read an entire
  dataset into memory with the same efficient parsing code. In this paper, we present
  these functions through a set of examples with an emphasis on the flexibility provided
  by chunk-wise operations. We provide benchmarks comparing the speed of read.csv.raw
  to data loading functions provided in base R and other contributed packages.
