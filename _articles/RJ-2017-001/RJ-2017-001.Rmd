title: 'iotools: High-Performance I/O Tools for R'
abstract: The *iotools* package provides a set of tools for input and output intensive
  data processing in R. The functions `chunk.apply` and `read.chunk` are supplied
  to allow for iteratively loading contiguous blocks of data into memory as raw vectors.
  These raw vectors can then be efficiently converted into matrices and data frames
  with the *iotools* functions `mstrsplit` and `dstrsplit`. These functions minimize
  copying of data and avoid the use of intermediate strings in order to drastically
  improve performance. Finally, we also provide `read.csv.raw` to allow users to read
  an entire dataset into memory with the same efficient parsing code. In this paper,
  we present these functions through a set of examples with an emphasis on the flexibility
  provided by chunk-wise operations. We provide benchmarks comparing the speed of
  `read.csv.raw` to data loading functions provided in base R and other contributed
  packages.

# Introduction

When processing large datasets, specifically those too large to fit into
memory, the performance bottleneck is often getting data from the
hard-drive into the format required by the programming environment. The
associated latency comes from a combination of two sources. First, there
is hardware latency from moving data from the hard-drive to RAM. This is
especially the case with "spinning" disk drives, which can have
throughput speeds several orders of magnitude less than those of RAM.
Hardware approaches for addressing latency have been an active area of
research and development since hard-drives have existed. Solid state
drives and redundant arrays of inexpensive disks (RAID) now provide
throughput comparable to RAM. They are readily available on commodity
systems and they continue to improve. The second source comes from the
software latency associated with transforming data from its
representation on the disk to the format required by the programming
environment. This translation slows down performance for many R  users,
especially in the context of larger data sources.

We can compare the time needed to read, parse, and create a data frame
with the time needed to just read data from disk. In order to do this,
we will make use of the "Airline on-time performance" dataset, which was
compiled for the 2009 American Statistical Association (ASA) Section on
Statistical Computing and Statistical Graphics biannual data exposition
from data released by the United States Department of Transportation
[@AirlineDataSet]. The dataset includes commercial flight arrival and
departure information from October 1987 to April 2008 for those carriers
with at least 1% of domestic U.S. flights in a given year. In total,
there is information for over 120 million flights, with 29 variables
related to flight time, delay time, departure airport, arrival airport,
and so on. The uncompressed dataset is 12 gigabytes (GB) in size. While
$12\,$GBs may not seem impressively "big" to many readers, it is still
large enough to investigate the performance properties and, unlike most
other large datasets, it is freely available. Supplemental materials,
accessible at <https://github.com/statsmaths/iotools-supplement>,
provide code for downloading the dataset and running the benchmarks
included in this paper.

In a first step before measuring the time to load the dataset, column
classes are defined so that this part of the data frame processing does
not become part of our timings. These can be inferred by reviewing the
dataset documentation and inspecting the first few rows of data. The
column data types for this dataset are given by:

``` r
> col_types <- c(rep("integer", 8), "character", "integer", "character",
+                rep("integer", 5), "character", "character",
+                rep("integer", 4), "character", rep("integer", 6))
```

Now, we will read in the file `2008.csv`, which contains comma-separated
values with 29 columns and 7,009,728 rows.

``` r
> system.time(read.csv("2008.csv", colClasses = col_types))[["elapsed"]]
[1] 68.257
```

It takes just over 68 seconds to read the file into R and parse its
contents into a data frame object. We can test how much of this time is
due to just loading the results from the hard-drive into R's memory.
This is done using the `readBin` function to read the file as a raw
string of bytes and `file.info` to infer the total size of the file;
both functions are provided by the *base* package of R.

``` r
> system.time(readBin("2008.csv", "raw",
+             file.info("2008.csv")[["size"]]))[["elapsed"]]
[1] 0.493
```

This takes less than one half of a second. It takes about 138 times
longer to read and parse the data with `read.csv` than to just read the
data in as raw bytes, indicating there may be room for improvement. This
is not to say `read.csv` and its associated functions are poorly
written. On the contrary, they are robust and do an excellent job
inferring format and shape characteristics from data. They allow users
to import and examine a dataset without knowing how many rows it has,
how many columns it has, or its column types. Because of these
functions, statisticians using R are able to focus on data exploration
and modeling instead of file formats and schemas.

While existing functions are sufficient for processing relatively small
datasets, larger ones require a different approach. For large files,
data are often processed on a single machine by first being broken into
a set of consecutive rows or "chunks." Each chunk is loaded and
processed individually, before retrieving the next chunk. The results
from processing each chunk are then aggregated and returned. Small,
manageable subsets are streamed from the disk to the processor with
enough memory to represent a single chunk required by the system. This
approach is common not only in single machine use but also in
distributed environments with technologies such as Spark [@Spark] and
Hadoop MapReduce [@Dean2008]. Clusters of commodity machines, such as
those provided by Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) and Digital Ocean,
are able to process vast amounts of data one chunk at a time. Many
statistical methods are compatible with this computational approach and
are justified in a variety of contexts, including [@Hartigan1975],
[@Kleiner2011], [@Guha2012], and [@Matloff2014].

However, base R together with the contributed packages currently does
not provide convenient functionality to implement this common computing
pattern. Packages such as
[*bigmemory*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=bigmemory) [@Kane2013]
and [*ff*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=ff) [@ff] provide data
structures using their own binary formats over memory-mapped files
stored on disk. The data structures they provide are not native
R objects. They therefore do not exhibit properties such as
copy-on-write behavior, which avoids making unnecessary copies of the
dataset in memory [@rodeh2008b], and, in general, they cannot be
seamlessly integrated with R's plethora of user contributed packages.
The [*readr*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=readr) package [@readr]
provides fast importing of `"data.frame"` objects but it does not
support chunk-wise operations for arbitrarily large files. The
[*foreach*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=foreach) package
[@foreach], and its associated
[*iterators*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=iterators) package
[@iterators], provide a general framework for chunked processing but
does not provide the low-level connection-based utilities for
transforming binary data stored on the disk to those native to R.

The [*iotools*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=iotools) package
provides tools for data processing using any data source represented as
a connection [@iotools]. Users of the package can import text data into
R and process large datasets iteratively over small chunks. The
package's functions can be several orders of magnitude faster than R's
native facilities. The package provides general tools for quickly
processing large datasets in consecutive chunks and provides a basis for
speeding up distributed computing frameworks including Hadoop Streaming
[@Hadoop] and Spark.

The remainder of this paper introduces the use of the *iotools* package
for quickly importing datasets and processing them in R. Examples center
around the calculation of ordinary least squares (OLS) slope
coefficients via the normal equations in a linear regression. This
particular application was chosen because it balances read and write
times with processing time.

# Input methods and formatters

R's file operations make use of Standard C input and output operations
including `fread` and `fwrite`. Data are read in, elements are parsed,
and parsed values populate data structures. The *iotools* package also
uses the Standard C library but it makes use of "bulk" binary operations
including `memchr` and `strchr`. These functions make use of hardware
specific, single instruction, multiple data operations (SIMD) and tend
to be faster than their Standard I/O counterparts. (See, for example,
@zhou2002implementing for a complete overview of the benefits and common
implementations of SIMD instructions.) As a result, *iotools* is able to
find and retrieve data at a higher rate. In addition, an entire dataset
or chunk is buffered rather than scanned and transformed line-by-line as
in the `read.table` function. Thus, by buffering chunks of data and
making use of low-level, system functions *iotools* is able to provide
faster data ingestion than what is available in base R.

## Importing data with `dstrsplit` and `read.csv.raw`

A core function in the *iotools* package is `dstrsplit`. It takes either
a `raw` or `character` vector and splits it into a data frame according
to a specified separator. Each column may be parsed into a `logical`,
`integer`, `numeric`, `character`, `raw`, `complex` or `POSIXct` vector.
Columns of type `factor` are not supported as a method of input, though
columns may be converted to a factor once the dataset is loaded. It will
be shown later that `dstrsplit` can be used in a streaming context and
in this case data are read sequentially. As a result, the set of factor
levels cannot be deduced until the entire sequence is read. However, in
most cases, a caller knows the schema and is willing to specify factor
levels after loading the data or is willing to use a single pass to find
all of the factor levels.

The tools in *iotools* were primarily developed to support the
chunk-wise processing of large datasets that are too large to be read
entirely into memory. As an additional benefit it was observed that
these functions are also significantly faster when compared to the
`read.table` family of functions when importing a large plain-text
character separated dataset into R. The `readAsRaw` function takes
either a connection or a file name and returns the contents as a `raw`
type. Combining this with `dstrsplit`, we can load the `2008.csv` file
significantly faster:

``` r
> system.time(dstrsplit(readAsRaw("2008.csv"), sep = ",",
+             col_types = col_types))[["elapsed"]]
[1] 14.087
```

This takes about 14 seconds, which is roughly a five-fold decrease when
compared to the `read.csv` function. In order to simplify its usage, the
function `read.csv.raw` was written as a wrapper around `dstrsplit` for
users who want to use *iotools* to import data in a manner similar to
`read.table`:

``` r
> system.time(read.csv.raw("2008.csv", colClasses = col_types))[["elapsed"]]
[1] 14.251
```

The performance is very similar to the `dstrsplit` example.

Table [1](#tab:bench_data_frame) shows the time needed to import a data
file with 1,000,000 rows and 25 columns using `readRDS`, `dstrsplit`,
`read_csv` (from the *readr* package), and `read.table`. Imports were
performed for each of R's native types to see how their different size
requirements affect performance. The return value of `read_csv` includes
additional metadata because a 'tbl_df' object is returned, which is a
subtype of R's native `"data.frame"` class. Otherwise all functions
return the exact same data. The benchmarks show that, except for
character vectors, `readRDS` is fastest. This is unsurprising since
`readRDS` stores the binary representation of an R object and importing
consists of copying the file to memory and registering the object in R.
`read_csv`'s performance is reasonably close to those of *iotools*
across all three platforms and data types. The *iotools* functions are
generally faster on integer and numeric types, whereas the *readr*
functions are slightly faster on character types. In both cases, no
performance is lost when dealing with data sets that have mixed data
types and results are consistent across operating systems.

## Processing the model matrix

In this and the following section, we will show how to estimate, based
on the entire Airline on-time performance datase, the slope coefficients
for the follwoing linear regression model using OLS:
$$\label{eqn:regression}
ArrDelay \sim DayOfWeek + DepTime + Month + DepDelay.   (\#eq:eqnregression)$$
The OLS slope estimates can be calculated by creating the model matrix
and applying the normal equations to derive the coefficients. Given the
size of the dataset in this example, it will not be possible to
calculate the normal equation matrices directly in memory. Instead, the
model matrix will be created sequentially over blocks of rows. As this
dataset is further split with each year of data being stored in a
separate file, we will also need an outer loop over the available yearly
files (1988 to 2008).

We first construct the model matrix and save it in a file on disk; the
slope coefficients will be calculated in a second step. Separate
processing and model fitting in this case are mostly for the sake of
breaking down the example into digestible bits. In many real-world data
challenges it may still be a good idea, as it provides an intermediate
way of checking whether problems arise while fitting the model.
Regardless if problems occur either due to a bug in the code or an
interruption in computing services, the model matrix does not need to be
recalculated.

In order to construct a large model matrix file, we cycle over the
individual data files and work on each separately. Each file is loaded
using the `read.csv.raw` function, the variables `DayOfWeek` and `Month`
are converted into factors. The departure time variable is given in a
24-hour format, in local time, and with the colon removed from a
standard representation of time. For example, 4:30pm is given as "1630"
and 5:23am is "523". Our code extracts the hour and minute and converts
the time into minutes since midnight; less than 0.5% of the flights
depart between midnight and 3:59am, so ignoring the circular nature of
time is reasonable in this simple application. Finally, the entire
output is stored as a comma separated file with the first column
representing the response.

``` r
> out_file <- file("airline_mm.csv", "wb")
> for (data_file in sprintf("%04d.csv", 1988:2008)) {
+   df <- read.csv.raw(data_file, col_types = col_types)
+   df$DayOfWeek <- factor(df$DayOfWeek, levels = 1:7)
+   df$Month <- factor(df$Month, levels = 1:12)
+   df$DepTime <- sprintf("%04d", df$DepTime)
+   df$DepTime <- as.numeric(substr(df$DepTime, 1, 2)) * 60 +
+                 as.numeric(substr(df$DepTime, 3, 4))
+
+   mf <- model.frame(ArrDelay ~ DayOfWeek + DepTime + DepDelay + Month, df)
+   mm <- cbind(model.response(mf), model.matrix(mf, df))
+   rownames(mm) <- NULL
+   writeBin(as.output(mm, sep = ","), out_file)
+ }
> mm_names <- colnames(mm)
> close(out_file)
```

The output connection is recycled in each iteration of the loop thereby
appending each year's data; the names of the model matrix are stored in
memory for the next step. In the end we have one large file that
contains the entire model matrix. The output is representative of the
kinds of large datasets often encountered in industry applications.

## Fitting the model with `mstrsplit` and `chunk.apply`

With the model matrices created, the next step is to estimate the slope
coefficients $\beta$ in the model
$$\label{eqn:linear_model}
Y = X \beta + \varepsilon,   (\#eq:eqnlinear-model)$$
where $Y, \varepsilon \in \mathbb{R}^n$, and $\beta\in\mathbb{R}^d$,
$n\ge d$; each element of $\varepsilon$ is an i.i.d. random variable
with mean zero; and $X$ is a matrix in $\mathbb{R}^{n \times d}$ with
full column rank. The analytic solution for estimating the OLS slope
coefficients, $\beta$, is
$$\label{eqn:lm_closed_form}
\widehat \beta = \left( X^T X \right)^{-1} X^T Y.   (\#eq:eqnlm-closed-form)$$
Consider the row-wise partitioning (or chunking) of Equation
\@ref(eq:eqnlinear-model):
$$\begin{pmatrix} Y_1 \\ Y_2 \\ \vdots \\ Y_r \end{pmatrix} =
  \begin{pmatrix} X_1 \\ X_2 \\ \vdots \\ X_r
\end{pmatrix}
  \beta +\begin{pmatrix} \varepsilon_1 \\ \varepsilon_2 \\ \vdots \\
                 \varepsilon_r \end{pmatrix},$$
where $Y_1, Y_2, ..., Y_r$; $X_1, X_2, ..., X_r$; and
$\varepsilon_1, \varepsilon_2, ...,  \varepsilon_r$ are data partitions
where each chunk is composed of subsets of rows of the model matrix.
Equation \@ref(eq:eqnlm-closed-form) may then be expressed as
[@friedman2001elements],
$$\label{blockwise_full}
\hat{\beta} = \left(\sum_{i=1}^r X_i^T X_i \right)^{-1}
\sum_{i=1}^r X_i^T Y_i.   (\#eq:blockwise-full)$$
The matrices $X_i^TX_i$ and $X_i^T Y_i$ can be calculated on each chunk
and then summed to calculate the slope coefficients.

In the previous step, the data were read into a data frame, but we now
need to read data into a numeric matrix. Interestingly enough, this
functionality is not provided in base R or the
[*Matrix*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=Matrix) [@matrix] package.
Users who wanted to read data from a file into a matrix must read it in
as a data frame and then convert it using the `as.matrix` function. The
*iotools* package fills this gap by providing the function `mstrsplit`,
a matrix import function similar to function `dstrsplit`.
Table [2](#tab:bench_matrix) compares the performance of `mstrsplit`
with `read.table` followed by a call to `as.matrix` along binary
importing using `load`. As with `dstrsplit`, `mstrsplit` outperforms the
base R's `read.table` benchmarks by an order of magnitude.

In order to fit the model we will need to read from `airline_mm.csv` in
chunks. The function `chunk.apply`, provided in *iotools*, allows us to
do this easily over an open connection. By default the data is read in
as 32MB chunks, though this can be changed by the `CH.MAX.SIZE`
parameter to `chunk.apply`. The parameter `CH.MERGE` describes how the
outputs of all the chunks are combined. Common options include `list`
or, when the result is a single vector, `c`. Here, we use `chunk.apply`
to calculate the matrices $X^T y$ and $X^T X$ over chunks of the data:

``` r
> ne_chunks <- chunk.apply("airline_mm.csv",
+   function(x) {
+     mm <- mstrsplit(x, sep = ",", type= " numeric")
+     colnames(mm) <- mm_names
+     list(xtx = crossprod(mm[, -1]),
+          xty = crossprod(mm[, -1], mm[, 1, drop = FALSE]))
+   }, CH.MERGE = list)
```

Notice that we do not need to manually specify the chunks; this detail
is abstracted away by the `chunk.apply` function, which simply selects
contiguous sets of rows for our function to evaluate. The output of the
chunk-wise operation can be combined using the `Reduce` function:

``` r
> xtx <- Reduce("+", Map(function(x) x$xtx, ne_chunks))
> xty <- Reduce("+", Map(function(x) x$xty, ne_chunks))
```

With these results, the regression function can be solved with the
normal equations where $d$ is small.

``` r
> qr.solve(xtx, xty)

The technique used by the `lm` function is similar to our approach,
except that the QR-decomposition there is done directly on $X$ itself
rather that on $X^TX$. The difference is rarely an issue unless the
problem is particularly ill-conditioned. In these cases, a small ridge
regression penalty can be added to stabilize the solution
[@friedman2001elements].

## Parallel processing of chunks

In the example above the `xtx` and `xty` chunks are calculated serially.
The `chunk.apply` function includes a parameter, `parallel`, allowing
the user to specify the number of parallel processes, taking advantage
of the embarrassingly parallel nature of these calculations. However, it
is worth noting that parallelism in the `chunk.apply` function is
slightly different from other functions such as `mclapply`.

Most parallel functions in R work by having worker processes receive
data and an expression to compute. The master process initiates the
computations and waits for them to complete. For I/O-intensive
computations this in general means that either the master loads data
before initiating the computation or the worker processes load the data.
The former case is supported in *iotools* through iterator functions
(`idstrsplit` and `imstrsplit`), which are compatible with the *foreach*
package. However, in this case, new tasks cannot be started until data
has been loaded for each of the workers. Loading the data on the master
process may become a bottleneck and it may require much more time to
load the data than to process it. The latter approach is also supported
in *iotools* and ensures the master process is not a bottleneck. If,
however, multiple worker processes on a single machine load a large
amount of data from the same disk, resource contention at the system
level may also cause excessive delays. The operating system has to
service multiple requests for data from the same disk having limited I/O
capability.

A third option, implemented in `chunk.apply`, provides *pipeline
parallelism* where the master process sequentially loads data and then
calls `mcparallel` to initiate the parallel computation. When the
maximum number of worker processes has been reached the master process
*pre-fetches* the next chunk and then blocks on the result of the
running worker processes. When the result is returned a newly created
worker begins processing the pre-fetched data. In this way the master
does not wait idly for worker processing and there is no resource
contention since only the master is retrieving data. Pipeline
parallelism increases execution throughput when the computation time is
around the same order as the load time. When the load time exceeds the
execution time, the overhead involved in initiating worker processes and
getting their results will yield less desirable performance gains from
parallelization. In the case of particularly long load times, the
overhead will overwhelm the process and the parallel execution may be
slower than a single serial calculation.

Figure [1](#fig:par_lm_times) shows the times required to calculate
$X^TX$ and $X^TY$ for the normal equations in the regression described
above using the three approaches described: all workers read, only the
master reads, and pipeline parallelism. Pipeline parallelism performs
the best overall, with all workers reading following close behind.
However, all workers reading will only be able to keep pace with
pipeline parallelism as long as there is sufficient hard-drive bandwidth
and little contention from multiple reads. As a result, the pipeline
parallel approach is likely a more general and therefore preferred
strategy.

# Conclusion

This paper presents the *iotools* package for the processing of data
much larger than memory. Tools are included to efficiently load
medium-sized files into memory and to parse raw vectors into matrices
and data frames. The chunk-wise functionality is used as a building
block to enable the processing of terabyte- and even petabyte-scale
data. The examples emphasize computing on a single machine, however
*iotools* is by no means limited to this configuration. The "chunk"
functions are compatible with any object derived from a connection and
can therefore be used with compressed files or even pipes and sockets.
Our current work, in fact, uses *iotools* as a building block for more
tightly integrating R  into the Hadoop Streaming and Spark frameworks.
