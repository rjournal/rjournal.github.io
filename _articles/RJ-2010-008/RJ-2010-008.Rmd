title: Two-sided Exact Tests and Matching Confidence Intervals for Discrete Data
abstract: 'There is an inherent relationship between two-sided hypothesis tests and
  confidence intervals. A series of two-sided hypothesis tests may be inverted to
  obtain the matching 100(1-α)% confidence interval defined as the smallest interval
  that contains all point null parameter values that would not be rejected at the
  α level. Unfortunately, for discrete data there are several different ways of defining
  two-sided exact tests and the most commonly used two-sided exact tests are defined
  one way, while the most commonly used exact confidence intervals are inversions
  of tests defined another way. This can lead to inconsistencies where the exact test
  rejects but the exact confidence interval contains the null parameter value. The
  packages exactci and exact2x2 provide several exact tests with the matching confidence
  intervals avoiding these inconsistencies as much as possible. Examples are given
  for binomial and Poisson parameters and both paired and unpaired 2 × 2 tables. Applied
  statisticians are increasingly being encouraged to report confidence intervals (CI)
  and parameter estimates along with p-values from hypothesis tests. The htest class
  of the stats package is ideally suited to these kinds of analyses, because all the
  related statistics may be presented when the results are printed. For exact two-sided
  tests applied to discrete data, a test-CI inconsistency may occur: the p-value may
  indicate a significant result at level α while the associated 100(1-α)% confidence
  interval may cover the null value of the parameter. Ideally, we would like to present
  a unified report (Hirji, 2006), whereby the p-value and the confidence interval
  match as much as possible.'
