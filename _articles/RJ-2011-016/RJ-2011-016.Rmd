title: Nonparametric Goodness-of-Fit Tests for Discrete Null Distributions
abstract: Methodology extending nonparametric goodness-of-fit tests to discrete null
  distributions has existed for several decades. However, modern statistical software
  has generally failed to provide this methodology to users. We offer a revision of
  R’s ks.test() function and a new cvm.test() function that fill this need in the
  R language for two of the most popular nonparametric goodness-of-fit tests. This
  paper describes these contributions and provides examples of their usage. Particular
  attention is given to various numerical issues that arise in their implementation.
