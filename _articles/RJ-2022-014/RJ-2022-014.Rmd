title: fcaR, Formal Concept Analysis with R
abstract: ' Formal concept analysis (FCA) is a solid mathematical framework to manage
  information based on logic and lattice theory. It defines two explicit representations

# Introduction

The main goal of knowledge retrieval and knowledge discovery systems is
to extract hidden patterns, trends, behaviours, or rules to solve
large-impact real-world problems. Usually, these problems present
heterogeneous data sources and are at the core of more general decision
processes.

A fundamental principle is that the extracted knowledge should provide
some understanding of the analyzed data. As computational systems get in
critical and sensitive areas such as medicine, the justice system or
financial markets, the knowledge becomes much more relevant to make
predictions or recommendations or to detect common interest groups or
leaders. However, in many cases, the inability of humans to understand
the extracted patterns seems problematic.

To represent and retrieve knowledge from datasets, it has become more
important to use formal methods based on logic tools. The formal
representation of knowledge and the use of logic tools are more suitable
for providing understandable answers. Therefore, it can help avoid the
lack of interpretability and explainability of the results.

In particular, formal concept analysis (FCA)
[@wille1982restructuring; @Ganter1999] is a well-founded mathematical
tool, based on lattice theory and logic, which can retrieve and store
the knowledge in the form of concepts (analogous to closed itemsets in
transactional databases) and implications (association rules with
confidence 1). From this perspective, FCA constitutes a framework that
complements and extends the study of exact and approximate association
rules.

The origins of FCA were devoted to the study of binary datasets (formal
contexts) where variables are called attributes. A relevant extension of
FCA uses fuzzy sets [@BeVyAddgI; @BeVyAddgII] to model real-world
problems since datasets may contain imprecise, graded or vague
information that is not adequately represented as binary values. The
fuzzy extension can also model problems with numerical and categorical
attributes since these can be scaled to a truth value describing the
degree of fulfilment of the attribute.

Some authors have considered the use of FCA in machine learning.
@Kuznetsov04 relates FCA to some mathematical models of machine
learning. @Ignatov2015 summarizes the main topics in machine learning
and data mining where FCA has been applied: frequent itemset mining and
association rules to make classification and clustering. A closer
approach appears in @Trabelsi17, where a method for supervised
classification based on FCA is used. The authors extract rules based on
concepts generated previously from data. These rules are used to compute
the closure of a set of attributes to obtain a classification rule.

From a dataset, FCA can establish maximal clusters, named concepts,
between objects and attributes. Each cluster consists of objects having
common properties (attributes), which are only fulfilled for these
objects. The hierarchy between the concepts and relationships between
the attributes (rules or implications) are computed with the same
computational cost in FCA.

Among all the techniques used in other areas to extract knowledge, we
emphasize using rules for its theoretical and practical interest. The
notion of if-then rules, with different names, appears in several areas
(databases, machine learning, data mining, formal concept analysis) as a
relationship between attributes, called items, properties or atomic
symbols regarding the domain. Nowadays, the number of rules extracted
even from medium-sized datasets is enormous in all these areas.
Therefore, the intelligent manipulation of these rules to reason with
them is a hot topic to be explored.

In this direction, @Cordero2002 introduced a logic, named simplification
logic for functional dependencies ($SL_{FD}$), firmly based on a
simplification rule, which allows us to narrow the functional dependency
set by removing redundant attributes. Although the semantic of
implications or if-then rules in other areas are different, the logic
can be used too.

Using directly $SL_{FD}$, some automated deduction methods directly
based on this inference system have been developed for classical systems
and fuzzy systems
[@mora_efficient_2004; @Cordero2012; @Mora2012; @cla2014; @Lorenzo2015].

In the fuzzy framework, several approaches to the definition of fuzzy
implications (functional dependencies, rules) are proposed in the
literature, see @JEZKOVA2017 for a survey. Our work considers that the
definition of graded implication proposed by @BeVyAddgI [@BeVyAddgII]
generalizes all the previous definitions. Furthermore, for this general
definition of graded implications, an axiomatic system named FASL (fuzzy
attribute simplification logic) was developed by
@belohlavek2016automated, becoming a helpful reasoning tool. Note that
FASL is a generalization of $SL_{FD}$ to the fuzzy framework.

The core of our proposal is to provide a user-friendly computational
interface to the principal operators and methods of fuzzy FCA, including
the mentioned logic tools. This interface is easy to extend to new
functionalities and incorporate new methods, such as minimal generators
or the computation of different implication bases quickly. The operators
and methods implemented are designed to work in the general fuzzy
setting, but they are also applicable in the classical binary case.

Thus, the focus of our proposal, the fcaR package, is to provide easy
access to formal methods to extract all the implicit knowledge in a
dataset in the form of concepts and implications, working natively with
fuzzy sets and fuzzy implications. Our goal is to provide a unified
computational framework for the theoretically-oriented FCA users to
develop, test, and compare new methods and knowledge extraction
strategies.

Other objectives of this work include presenting an FCA-based tool for
knowledge discovery accessible to other scientific communities, allowing
for the development of new packages in other fields using FCA
techniques, especially in the construction of recommendation systems.

The work is organized as follows: Section  begins with a brief look of
FCA and Simplification Logic. Section  presents other software libraries
that implement FCA or related paradigms' core notions. In Section , an
explanation of the data structures, classes and constructor methods is
covered. Section  shows how to use the package, describing the
implemented FCA methods and the use of the simplification logic. In
Section , a real application of the package in developing a recommender
system is illustrated. Finally, some conclusions and future works are
presented in Section .

# Background on FCA {#definitions}

In this section, we present the basic notions in the FCA framework using
a running example (see Table [1](#tab:fc){reference-type="ref"
reference="tab:fc"}). Note that the package incorporates the main
methods in FCA that appear in this summary. Since the formal study of
FCA is not the main scope of this work, we recommend the reference
[@ganter2016conceptual] for further details of this framework.

::: {#tab:fc}
        P1   P2   P3   P4
  ---- ---- ---- ---- ----
  O1    0             
  O2         1    0    1
  O3         1    0    1
  O4    0         1   

  : A sample formal context. The attributes are P1 to P4 and the objects
  are named O1 to O4.
:::

A *formal context* is a triple $(G, M, I)$, where $G$ is a set of
objects, $M$ is a set of attributes and $I$ is a fuzzy relation between
objects and attributes, where $I(x, y) \in [0, 1]$ means the truth value
to which object $x$ possesses attribute $y$, indicating $I(x,y) = 0$ the
absence of attribute or property $y$ in object $x$.

The meaning of each entry in the table is the extent to which an object
possesses the attribute in the corresponding column. In the example
shown in Table [1](#tab:fc){reference-type="ref" reference="tab:fc"},
the object named O4 fully possesses attribute P3 and possesses P2 and P4
only to degree 50%.

In the remaining of this paper, we will use the notation $^{d\!}/a$ to
indicate the presence of attribute $a$ with degree $d$.

::: {#derivation-operators}
## Derivation operators
:::

Given a fuzzy set of objects $\mathcal{S}$, we can compute its *intent*
as the set of attributes that are shared by all objects in
$\mathcal{S}$. Analogously, we define the *extent* of a set
$\mathcal{T}$ of attributes as the set of objects which have *all* the
attributes in $\mathcal{T}$.

In the above example, for
$S=$$\left\{\mathrm{O1},\, \mathrm{O2}\right\}$, we have
$\text{intent}(S)=$$\left\{{^{0.5}}\!/\mathrm{P2},\, {^{0.5}}\!/\mathrm{P4}\right\}$
because $I(\mathrm{O1}, \mathrm{P2}) = 0.5$,
$I(\mathrm{O1}, \mathrm{P4}) = 0.5$, $I(\mathrm{O2}, \mathrm{P2}) = 1$
and $I(\mathrm{O2}, \mathrm{P4}) = 1$.

The operator $\phi$ defined by
$\phi(T) = \text{intent}(\text{extent}(T))$ is a closure operator and a
set of attributes $\mathcal{T}$ is called *closed* if
$\mathcal{T} = \phi(\mathcal{T})$. In our example,
$\phi(\ensuremath{\left\{{^{0.5}}\!/\mathrm{P1}\right\}}) = \ensuremath{\left\{{^{0.5}}\!/\mathrm{P1},\, \mathrm{P2},\, \mathrm{P4}\right\}}$,
meaning that *every object* that has P1 with degree at least 0.5, also
has all the attributes $\left\{\mathrm{P2},\, \mathrm{P4}\right\}$. When
$\mathcal{T}$ is closed, the pair
$(\text{extent}(\mathcal{T}), \mathcal{T})$ is called a *concept*.

In general, a concept $(A, B)$, where $A$ is a set of objects, and $B$
is a set of attributes, means that the only attributes shared by all
objects in $A$ are those in $B$, and the only objects having all
attributes in $B$ are those in $A$. This property makes $(A, B)$ a
*maximal rectangular cluster* in the dataset, with a strong dependence
between the objects in $A$ and the attributes in $B$. In the formal
context represented in Table [1](#tab:fc){reference-type="ref"
reference="tab:fc"}, the pair
$\left(\ensuremath{\left\{\mathrm{O2},\, \mathrm{O3}\right\}}, \ensuremath{\left\{{^{0.5}}\!/\mathrm{P1},\, \mathrm{P2},\, \mathrm{P4}\right\}}\right)$
is a concept, because
$\text{extent}(\ensuremath{\left\{{^{0.5}}\!/\mathrm{P1},\, \mathrm{P2},\, \mathrm{P4}\right\}})=\ensuremath{\left\{\mathrm{O2},\, \mathrm{O3}\right\}}$
and
$\text{intent}(\ensuremath{\left\{\mathrm{O2},\, \mathrm{O3}\right\}})=\ensuremath{\left\{{^{0.5}}\!/\mathrm{P1},\, \mathrm{P2},\, \mathrm{P4}\right\}}$,
i.e. a fixpoint is achieved.

In FCA, using these derivation operators, two operations can be used to
reduce a formal context:

-   *Clarification*, which is the removal of duplicated rows (objects)
    and columns (attributes) of the formal context since duplicates do
    not contribute knowledge to the context.

-   *Reduction*, which removes attributes that can be expressed as the
    closure of other attributes.

These two operations remove redundancies in the formal context without
affecting the knowledge contained in it. Many of the subsequent
operations in FCA have high computational complexity, and clarifying and
reducing a formal context may reduce the computational time of posterior
operations.

::: {#the-concept-lattice}
## The concept lattice
:::

The *concept lattice* of a formal context is the set of all concepts,
with the partial order $\le$ defined as follows: for two concepts
$(A_1, B_1)$ and $(A_2, B_2)$, we say that $(A_1, B_1) \le (A_2, B_2)$
if and only if $A_1 \subseteq A_2 \iff B_2 \subseteq B_1$. For instance,
$\ensuremath{\left(\ensuremath{\left\{{^{0.5}}\!/\mathrm{O2},\, {^{0.5}}\!/\mathrm{O3}\right\}}, \ensuremath{\left\{\mathrm{P1},\, \mathrm{P2},\, \mathrm{P4}\right\}}\right)}  \le \ensuremath{\left(\ensuremath{\left\{\mathrm{O2},\, \mathrm{O3}\right\}}, \ensuremath{\left\{{^{0.5}}\!/\mathrm{P1},\, \mathrm{P2},\, \mathrm{P4}\right\}}\right)}$,
since their intents verify
$\ensuremath{\left\{{^{0.5}}\!/\mathrm{P1},\, \mathrm{P2},\, \mathrm{P4}\right\}} \subseteq \ensuremath{\left\{\mathrm{P1},\, \mathrm{P2},\, \mathrm{P4}\right\}}$.

This order (or precedence) relationship induces a hierarchy of concepts,
which can be graphically represented in the Hasse diagram
[@birkhoff1940lattice] of the partially ordered set of concepts. In
Figure [1](#fig:lattice){reference-type="ref" reference="fig:lattice"},
we find the Hasse diagram corresponding to our running example.

![Concept lattice for the context in Table
[1](#tab:fc){reference-type="ref" reference="tab:fc"}. Arrows indicate
the direction of the order relationship between
concepts.](fig-lattice.pdf){#fig:lattice width="50%"}

From the concept lattice and the order relationship, we can define
notions as *subconcept*, *superconcept*, *infimum* and *supremum* of a
set of concepts.

Notably, there are the *irreducible elements*, for the infimum (meet) or
the supremum (join) operators, which, in the lattice, are shown as those
elements with only one arrow departing or arriving at them,
respectively. These elements are essential since one can reconstruct the
whole lattice by operating with these elements.

The *standard context* for a given formal context $\mathbb{K}$ is
another formal context $(\mathcal{J}, \mathcal{M}, \le)$, where
$\mathcal{J}$ and $\mathcal{M}$ are the sets of join- and
meet-irreducible elements of $\mathbb{K}$ and $\le$ is the partial order
defined in the concept lattice. This standard context has a concept
lattice isomorphic to that of $\mathbb{K}$.

::: {#implications-and-logic}
## Implications and logic
:::

The knowledge stored in a formal context can also be represented as a
set of implications, which are expressions of the form $A\Rightarrow B$
where $A$ and $B$ are sets of attributes or items, indicating that, for
every object in which the set of attributes $A$ is present, also $B$ is
present. This interpretation is similar to the one defined in data
mining/machine learning over the so-named association rules. The
confidence (a well-known estimator of the rules' quality) has value 1 in
all the implications.

For instance
$\left\{{^{0.5}}\!/\mathrm{P1}\right\}\Rightarrow\left\{\mathrm{P4}\right\}$
is a valid implication in the previous example, having the following
interpretation: when the attribute $\mathrm{P1}$ has degree at least
$0.5$ then we have $\mathrm{P4}$ with degree $1$.

The *Duquenne-Guigues basis* of implications [@guigues1986familles] is a
set of valid implications from which all other valid implications can be
deduced. The Duquenne-Guigues basis in our example is given by:

::: longtable*
rrcl 1:
&$\varnothing$&$\Rightarrow$&$\left\{{^{0.5}}\!/\mathrm{P2},\, {^{0.5}}\!/\mathrm{P4}\right\}$\
2:
&$\left\{{^{0.5}}\!/\mathrm{P2},\, \mathrm{P4}\right\}$&$\Rightarrow$&$\left\{\mathrm{P2}\right\}$\
3:
&$\left\{\mathrm{P2},\, {^{0.5}}\!/\mathrm{P4}\right\}$&$\Rightarrow$&$\left\{\mathrm{P4}\right\}$\
4:
&$\left\{\mathrm{P2},\, {^{0.5}}\!/\mathrm{P3},\, \mathrm{P4}\right\}$&$\Rightarrow$&$\left\{\mathrm{P3}\right\}$\
5:
&$\left\{{^{0.5}}\!/\mathrm{P1},\, {^{0.5}}\!/\mathrm{P2},\, {^{0.5}}\!/\mathrm{P4}\right\}$&$\Rightarrow$&$\left\{\mathrm{P2},\, \mathrm{P4}\right\}$\
6:
&$\left\{{^{0.5}}\!/\mathrm{P1},\, \mathrm{P2},\, \mathrm{P3},\, \mathrm{P4}\right\}$&$\Rightarrow$&$\left\{\mathrm{P1}\right\}$\
:::

In @Cordero2002, the simplification logic, denoted as $SL_{FD}$, was
introduced as a method to manipulate implications (functional
dependencies or if-then rules), removing redundancies or computing
closures of attributes. This logic is equivalent to Armstrong's Axioms
[@Armstrong1974], which are well known from the 80s in databases,
artificial intelligence, formal concept analysis, and others. The
axiomatic system of this logic considers reflexivity as the axiom scheme

::: center
`[Ref]`
:::

together with the following inference rules called fragmentation,
composition and simplification, respectively, which are equivalent to
the classical Armstrong's axioms of augmentation and, more importantly,
transitivity.

::: center
`[Frag]` $\displaystyle\frac{A\Rightarrow B\cup C}{A\Rightarrow B}$
`[Comp]` $\displaystyle\frac{A\Rightarrow B,\ C \Rightarrow D}{A\cup C \Rightarrow B\cup D}$
`[Simp]` $\displaystyle\frac{A\Rightarrow B,\ C \Rightarrow D}{A\cup(C\smallsetminus B)\Rightarrow(D\smallsetminus B)}$
:::

The main advantage of $SL_{FD}$ with respect to Armstrong's Axioms is
that the inference rules may be considered as equivalence rules, (see
the work by @Mora2012 for further details and proofs), that is, given a
set of implications $\Sigma$, the application of the equivalences
transforms it into an equivalent set. In the package presented in this
paper, we develop the following equivalences:

1.  Fragmentation Equivalency **\[FrEq\]**:
    $\{A\Rightarrow B\}\equiv\{A\Rightarrow B\smallsetminus A\}$.

2.  Composition Equivalency **\[CoEq\]**:
    $\{A\Rightarrow B, A\Rightarrow C\}\equiv\{A\Rightarrow B{\cup} C\}$.

3.  Simplification Equivalency **\[SiEq\]**: If $A\subseteq C$, then\

    $\{A\Rightarrow B, C \Rightarrow D\}\equiv  \{A\Rightarrow B, { A\cup(}C\smallsetminus B)\Rightarrow D\smallsetminus B\}$

4.  Right-Simplification Equivalency **\[rSiEq\]**: If $A\subseteq D$,
    then\

    $\{A\Rightarrow B, C\Rightarrow B\cup D\}\equiv \{A\Rightarrow B, C \Rightarrow D\}$

Usually, many areas, the implications have always atomic attributes on
the right-hand side. We emphasize that this logic can manage
*aggregated* implications, i.e. the implications' consequents do not
have to be singletons. This represents an increase of the logic
efficiency.

This logic removes attribute redundancies in some of the implications in
the Duquenne-Guigues basis presented before. Particularly, the
implications with numbers 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 are simplified to:

::: longtable*
rrcl 2:
&$\left\{\mathrm{P4}\right\}$&$\Rightarrow$&$\left\{\mathrm{P2}\right\}$\
3:
&$\left\{\mathrm{P2}\right\}$&$\Rightarrow$&$\left\{\mathrm{P4}\right\}$\
4:
&$\left\{{^{0.5}}\!/\mathrm{P3},\, \mathrm{P4}\right\}$&$\Rightarrow$&$\left\{\mathrm{P3}\right\}$\
5:
&$\left\{{^{0.5}}\!/\mathrm{P1}\right\}$&$\Rightarrow$&$\left\{\mathrm{P4}\right\}$\
6:
&$\left\{{^{0.5}}\!/\mathrm{P1},\, \mathrm{P3}\right\}$&$\Rightarrow$&$\left\{\mathrm{P1}\right\}$\
:::

One of the primary uses of a set of implications is computing the
closure of a set of attributes, the maximal fuzzy set that we can arrive
at from these attributes using the given implications.

The importance of computing the closure from implications is because
implications can be managed using logic tools. They formally describe
the knowledge existing in the dataset; thus, the user can forget about
the original *dataset*. In this sense, it is similar to supervised
Machine Learning techniques.

The algorithm to compute the closure [@Mora2012] is based on the
classical [closure]{.smallcaps} algorithm
[@maier1983theory; @ganter2016conceptual]. After each pass over the set
of implications, instead of simply removing the implications used in the
step, the simplification rule substitutes the implications by others
equivalent but simpler, with fewer attributes. In the binary case, the
reduced set of implications does not reference any attribute in the
computed closure. A detailed description of the procedure is presented
in Algorithm [\[algo:closure\]](#algo:closure){reference-type="ref"
reference="algo:closure"}.

::: algorithm
$\Gamma' := \Gamma \cup \{\varnothing\Rightarrow X\}$
$X_{\mathrm{new}} := X$ $X_{\mathrm{old}} := X$
:::

For instance, the closure of
$S = \ensuremath{\left\{{^{0.5}}\!/\mathrm{P2}\right\}}$ with this
algorithm is
$S^+ = \ensuremath{\left\{{^{0.5}}\!/\mathrm{P2},\, {^{0.5}}\!/\mathrm{P4}\right\}}$
(this means that all objects that have all the attributes in $S$, also
have those in $S^+$). The simplification logic leads us to a reduced set
of implications $\Gamma'$:

::: longtable*
rrcl 1:
&$\left\{\mathrm{P4}\right\}$&$\Rightarrow$&$\left\{\mathrm{P2}\right\}$\
2:
&$\left\{\mathrm{P2}\right\}$&$\Rightarrow$&$\left\{\mathrm{P4}\right\}$\
3:
&$\left\{\mathrm{P2},\, {^{0.5}}\!/\mathrm{P3},\, \mathrm{P4}\right\}$&$\Rightarrow$&$\left\{\mathrm{P3}\right\}$\
4:
&$\left\{{^{0.5}}\!/\mathrm{P1}\right\}$&$\Rightarrow$&$\left\{\mathrm{P2},\, \mathrm{P4}\right\}$\
5:
&$\left\{{^{0.5}}\!/\mathrm{P1},\, \mathrm{P2},\, \mathrm{P3},\, \mathrm{P4}\right\}$&$\Rightarrow$&$\left\{\mathrm{P1}\right\}$\
:::

One can interpret these implications as the knowledge in the original
implications if the attributes in $S$ are not considered (formally, this
is equivalent to suppose that $\varnothing\Rightarrow S$ is true). In
the example, if, in addition to having
$\left\{{^{0.5}}\!/\mathrm{P2}\right\}$, we have $\{\mathrm{P1}\}$ with
degree $0.5$, we can infer that $\{\mathrm{P2}\}$ and $\{\mathrm{P4}\}$
are fully present, by implication number 4.

The package presented in this paper has been developed in the R
language. In recent years, R has lived a *remarkable revolution* caused
in part by an increasing user community from many different scientific
fields. This has led to the development of reproducible research tools,
e.g., [rmarkdown](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=rmarkdown)
[@rmarkdown], and tools to connect and interact with other programming
languages, with packages like
[Rcpp](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=Rcpp) [@rcpp] or
[reticulate](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=reticulate)
[@reticulate]. Besides, the development of a game-changer programming
paradigm with *tidy* principles has provided a significant impact on R's
usability, see the
[tidyverse](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=tidyverse) of @tidyverse.

These facts have transformed R from a purely statistical language into
one of the most popular languages in data science, machine learning,
data mining or visualization. In R, there are multiple packages to
perform data mining and machine learning tasks. However, only a few of
them are focused on formal methods that can model and extract knowledge
in the form of implications and rules on fuzzy sets and operate on them
using logic tools.

The arules package by @Hashler provides the infrastructure for
representing, manipulating and analyzing transaction data and patterns
(frequent itemsets and association rules) in *binary* settings. The
[frbs](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=frbs) package [@frbs] presents
an implementation of various learning algorithms based on fuzzy
rule-based systems (FRBSs) for dealing with classification and
regression tasks. The [RKEEL](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=RKEEL)
package [@rkeel] is an R interface to KEEL, a popular Java software for
a large number of different knowledge data discovery tasks. It can
extract association rules from numerical datasets, but variables are
discretized or categorized first.

It must be noted that none of the previous approaches uses logic tools
to infer knowledge from the extracted rules and implications. Also, the
support for fuzzy sets is minimal, and none of them implements the core
notions of FCA.

Since the arules package has become a *de facto* standard, one of the
critical points in our proposal's design has been to get fcaR easily
integrated with arules.

In other programming languages, several libraries are implementing FCA
methods. Some of the most used libraries are focused on computing the
concept lattice and provide a graphical interface to operate with the
formal context and the concept lattice: ToscanaJ [@Becker_2005] and
Galicia [@valtchev2003galicia]. Other tools, such as Concept Explorer
(ConExp) [@yevtushenko2000system], with its new versions ConExp NG and
ConExp FX, besides their graphical capabilities, implement the core FCA
algorithms and operations: context editing, building concept lattices,
finding bases of implications and association rules, for instance.

The two most recent and fully-featured libraries are conexp-clj
[@hanika2019conexp] and GALACTIC [@demko2020galactic], focusing on their
extensibility and addition of multiple new algorithms, including the
implementation of closure operators and methods based on implications.

In Table [2](#tab:comparison){reference-type="ref"

features present in each of these libraries.

  : Functionality comparison among different software libraries for FCA.
  (1) The rules can be used only for classification or regression; (2)
  fcaR is integrated with arules to import and export exact association
  rules; (3) some packages do not use natively fuzzy sets as
  representation, but use scaled or discretized contexts.
:::

In conclusion, fcaR can be considered among the general-purpose FCA
tools with a more comprehensive feature list, integrating the core
notions of FCA and logic tools.

# Package design {#design}

In this section, we present the design principles and implementation
information about the fcaR package: the use of object-oriented
programming, the need to be integrated with the arules package, and its
use in reproducible research.

::: {#package-availability}
## Package availability
:::

This package is available in CRAN and can be installed using
install.packages('fcaR'). Also, the development version with new
features and bugfixes can be installed from GitHub using \
remotes::install_github('Malaga-FCA-group/fcaR').

All the documentation in the form of a pkgdown site can be found in

::: {#data-structures}
## Data structures
:::

Now, we present an overview of the data structures implemented in fcaR
and the design principles on which the development of the package has
been based. The main points are the
[R6](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=R6) [@R6] object-oriented
programming (OOP) paradigm and the extensive use of sparse matrices for
internal storage of objects.

The R6 OOP paradigm is being increasingly used in the R ecosystem since
its ability to encapsulate data structures and methods related to each
class in a single and straightforward interface exposed to the user.
This reason and its extensibility have made it the choice to implement
the data structures in this package.

The core of the fcaR package provides data structures that allow the
user to work seamlessly with formal contexts and sets of concepts and
implications. The main classes are presented in
Table [\[tab:classes\]](#tab:classes){reference-type="ref"
reference="tab:classes"}. Let us briefly describe the internal
representation of the main object classes.

::: tabular
p2.5cmp10.5cm Class name & Use\
\"Set\" & A basic class to store a fuzzy set using sparse matrices\
\"Concept\" & A pair of sets (extent, intent) forming a concept for a
given formal context\
\"ConceptLattice\" & A set of concepts with their hierarchical
relationship. It provides methods to compute notable elements,
sublattices and plot the lattice graph\
\"ImplicationSet\" & A set of implications, with functions to apply
logic and compute closure of attribute sets\
\"FormalContext\" & It stores a formal context, given by a table, and
provides functions to use derivation operators, simplify the context,
compute the concept lattice and the Duquenne-Guigues basis of
implications\
:::

::: {#formal-contexts}
### Formal contexts
:::

A formal context $(G, M, I)$ can be represented by a two-way table $I$
indicating the relationship between objects and attributes. This table
is expressed in matrix form in R, with rows corresponding to objects and
columns corresponding to attributes.

In the classical setting, as occurred in the arules package, a formal
context may represent a collection of *itemsets* which conform to a
*transactions database*. In such a setting, the matrix is binary, and
each of its entries represents the presence (1) or absence (0) of an
item in a particular itemset. A value of 1 in the matrix is interpreted
as the object fully possessing the associated attribute.

In this package, one of the main features is dealing with fuzzy or
graded attributes. Therefore $I$ is not a binary matrix anymore, but a
numerical matrix with entries in the interval $[0, 1]$. We emphasize
that our package can deal with binary datasets as a particular case of
the fuzzy case. Most of the methods implemented work for binary and
fuzzy Formal Concept Analysis.

The R6 class \"FormalContext\" stores the relationship matrix (or
*incidence* matrix, if binary) $I$ in a compressed sparse format, given
by class \"dgCMatrix\" from package
[Matrix](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=Matrix) [@Matrix]. The
reason to store $I$ as a sparse matrix is that, in practice, most
situations will occur with many objects, and only a few attributes
present for each object. This allows for greater computational
efficiency.

The main methods applicable to an object of the \"FormalContext\" class
are presented in
Table [\[tab:methodsFC\]](#tab:methodsFC){reference-type="ref"
reference="tab:methodsFC"}.

::: tabular
p3cmp10cm Method name & Purpose\

\"matrix\", a \"data.frame\" or a filename from where to import the
context\

closure(S) & Computes the closure of a set S of attributes\
clarify() & Performs clarification of a \"FormalContext\"\
reduce() & Performs reduction of a \"FormalContext\"\

algorithm for fuzzy formal contexts\
find_implications() & Uses the modified NextClosure for fuzzy formal
contexts to compute the concept lattice and the Duquenne-Guigues basis
of implications\
to_transactions() & Converts the formal context to an object of class
\"transactions\" from the arules package\
:::

The features of the R6 paradigm allow us to build another critical
aspect of a \"FormalContext\": it stores both the associated
\"ConceptLattice\" and the Duquenne-Guigues basis as an
\"ImplicationSet\", which can be accessed using fc\$concepts and
fc\$implications, respectively. Initially, these instances are empty (no
concepts nor implications are included), and they are filled with the
corresponding data as needed.

::: {#concept-lattices}
### Concept lattices
:::

A \"ConceptLattice\" object is usually built from a \"FormalContext\" or
by using some specific methods on an existing \"ConceptLattice\". Thus,
although it has a constructor method, the user will not likely use it to
create an instance of this class.

Internally, the \"ConceptLattice\" class stores three sparse matrices:
two for the extents and intents in matrix form (rows are
objects/attributes and columns represent concepts) and a sparse matrix
indicating the order relationship between concepts. The element $(i, j)$
of this matrix is 1 if and only if the $i$-th concept is a subconcept of
the $j$-th concept, otherwise it is 0.

The main methods of objects of the \"ConceptLattice\" class are
summarized in
Table [\[tab:methodsCL\]](#tab:methodsCL){reference-type="ref"
reference="tab:methodsCL"}.

::: tabular
p3.25cmp9.75cm Method name & Purpose\

superconcepts of a concept C\
lower_neighbours(C), upper_neighbours(C) & For a given concept C,
compute its lower and upper neighbours in the lattice\
:::

::: {#implication-sets}
### Implication sets
:::

There are two ways in which an \"ImplicationSet\" can be created: by
finding the implications of a given \"FormalContext\" or by importing a
\"rules\" object from the arules package.

In both cases, internally, an \"ImplicationSet\" object is composed of
two sparse matrices, lhs_matrix and rhs_matrix, representing the
left-hand and right-hand sides (LHS and RHS, respectively) of the
computed implications. As it is the default in Matrix, these matrices
are stored column-wise, such that column $j$ represents the $j$-th
implication in the set, and row $i$ stands for the $i$-th attribute.

The main methods applicable to an object of class \"ImplicationSet\" are
described in
Table [\[tab:methodsIS\]](#tab:methodsIS){reference-type="ref"
reference="tab:methodsIS"}.

::: tabular
p3.5cmp9.5cm Method name & Purpose\
new(A, B) & Constructor of the \"ImplicationSet\" class. A and B
represent the left-hand and right-hand sides of the implications\
add(P) & Concatenates the implications in the current set with those in
P\
closure(S) & Computes the closure of the attribute set S with respect to
the current implication set, applying the $SL_{FD}$ logic\

only the attributes in attr\
apply_rules(rules) & Transforms the \"ImplicationSet\" into another
using equivalence rules\
to_basis() & Transforms the \"ImplicationSet\" to an equivalent basis of
implications\
filter(lhs, rhs) & Filters the \"ImplicationSet\" to retrieve only
implications with specific attributes in the left-hand or in the
right-hand sides\
to_arules() & Converts a binary \"ImplicationSet\" to the \"rules\"
class of arules\
:::

::: {#interfacing-with-arules}
## Interfacing with arules
:::

One of the main design objectives in this package is interoperability
with the arules package since it can be considered a standard in the
field.

The constructor methods for the \"FormalContext\" and \"ImplicationSet\"
classes allow as inputs objects of types \"transactions and \"rules\",
respectively, from the arules package.

A \"transactions\" object in arules can be represented by a binary
formal context. Each transaction can be translated into one object as
defined in FCA. In contrast, different transaction items are mapped to
binary variables according to whether the item is present or not in the
transaction. Any object of type \"transactions\" can be used to
initialize a \"FormalContext\", assigning the labels of the items
present in the *transaction database* to the attributes' names in the
context, and using the \"itemMatrix\" as the internal representation of
the binary incidence matrix. Also, fcaR can export the \"FormalContext\"
to the \"transactions\" format, by using the to_transactions() method of
a binary \"FormalContext\".

Analogously, a \"rules\" object can be used to create a
\"ImplicationSet\". The LHS and RHS of the \"rules\" object are mapped
to the lhs_matrix and rhs_matrix of the \"ImplicationSet\". In addition,
the method to_arules() can be used to convert any binary
\"ImplicationSet\" to the \"rules\" format.

These interfaces allow the users who usually work in other areas with
arules to use FCA methods and algorithms for transactions databases, as
an extension of what can do in arules, and then, if necessary, to
convert back to the arules format.

::: {#use-for-reproducible-research}
## Use for reproducible research
:::

Another of the design goals of the fcaR package is that it could be used
in research and used in publications. All the implemented classes in
fcaR provide a to_latex() function so that concepts, implications and
the table of the formal context can be easily exported to LaTeX. Also,
the \"FormalContext\" and \"ConceptLattice\" classes have a plot()
method that allows to graphically represent that object types. This
plot() function allows to export the graphs in LaTeX format to be
included directly in PDF reports with publication quality (see the
Figures in this work).

All this document has been written using the Rmarkdown format using
these functions to generate the tables and listings of concepts and
implications. The only required LaTeX packages are amssymb (for some
mathematical symbols), longtable and caption (for the listings of
concepts and implications) and tikz (for plotting formal contexts and
concept lattices).

# Formal concept analysis with fcaR {#fcaR}

In this Section, we will show how to perform the basic operations
mentioned in Section . We will use the same formal context shown in
Table [1](#tab:fc){reference-type="ref" reference="tab:fc"}.

Let us suppose that the variable `I` stores the matrix corresponding to
that formal context. To create a new \"FormalContext\" with that matrix,
the command is fc \<- FormalContext\$new(I). Now, the object fc stores
the formal context and enables us to perform the corresponding
operations on it.

For example, we can access the attribute and object names with
fc\$attributes and fc\$objects, respectively. We can even plot a heatmap
(see Fig. [2](#fig:heatmap){reference-type="ref"
reference="fig:heatmap"}) to show the sparsity of the context, very
useful for large contexts.

![The heatmap representing the formal context shown in
Table [1](#tab:fc){reference-type="ref" reference="tab:fc"}, obtained by
doing fc\$plot(). A grey scale is used, where white indicates the value
0 for an object-attribute pair, while black indicates the value 1, with
the greys representing the intermediate values. This type of graph aids
visual inspection of the context, being able to check its sparsity,
density or possible patterns.](fig-context-heatmap.pdf){#fig:heatmap
width="30%"}

::: {#derivation-operators-1}
## Derivation operators
:::

The methods that implement the derivation operators are named after
them: intent(), extent() and closure(). They can be applied on objects
of type \"Set\", representing fuzzy sets of objects or attributes:

::: example
\> S \<- Set$new(fc$objects, O1 = 1, O2 = 1) \> S O1, O2 \> fc$intent(S)
{P2 [0.5], P4 [0.5]}
> T <- Set$new(fc$attributes, P1 = 1, P3 = 1)
> T
{P1, P3}
> fc$extent(T) \> fc$closure(T)
{P1, P2, P3, P4}
\end{example}

In addition, we can perform \emph{clarification} on the formal context,
by using \texorpdfstring%
{{\normalfont\ttfamily\hyphenchar\font=-1 fc\$clarify()}}%
{fc\$clarify()}, giving:

\begin{example}
FormalContext with 3 objects and 3 attributes.
           P1   P3  [P2, P4]
       O1  0   0.5     0.5
       O4  0    1      0.5
 [O2, O3] 0.5   0       1
\end{example}

The duplicated rows and columns in the formal context have been
collapsed, and the corresponding attributes and objects' names are
grouped together between brackets, e.g., {[}P2, P4{]}.

\hypertarget{concept-lattice}{%
\subsection{Concept lattice}\label{concept-lattice}}

The command to compute the concept lattice for a \texorpdfstring%
{{\normalfont\ttfamily\hyphenchar\font=-1 "FormalContext"}}%
{"FormalContext"}
\texorpdfstring%
{{\normalfont\ttfamily\hyphenchar\font=-1 fc}}%
{fc} is \texorpdfstring%
{{\normalfont\ttfamily\hyphenchar\font=-1 fc\$find\_concepts()}}%
{fc\$find\_concepts()}. The lattice is stored in
\texorpdfstring%
{{\normalfont\ttfamily\hyphenchar\font=-1 fc\$concepts}}%
{fc\$concepts}, which is of the \texorpdfstring%
{{\normalfont\ttfamily\hyphenchar\font=-1 "ConceptLattice"}}%
{"ConceptLattice"} class.

\begin{example}
> fc$concepts A set of 8 concepts: 1: (O1, O2, O3, O4, P2 \[0.5\], P4
\[0.5\]) 2: (O1, O4, P2 \[0.5\], P3 \[0.5\], P4 \[0.5\]) 3: (O1 \[0.5\],
O4, P2 \[0.5\], P3, P4 \[0.5\]) 4: (O1 \[0.5\], O2, O3, O4 \[0.5\], P2,
P4) 5: (O1 \[0.5\], O4 \[0.5\], P2, P3, P4) 6: (O2, O3, P1 \[0.5\], P2,
P4) 7: (O2 \[0.5\], O3 \[0.5\], P1, P2, P4) 8: (, P1, P2, P3, P4)
:::

In order to know the *cardinality* of the set of concepts (that is, the
number of concepts), we can use fc\$concepts\$size(), which gives 8 in
this case. The complete list of concepts can be printed with
fc\$concepts\$print(), or simply fc\$concepts. Also, they can be
translated to LaTeX using the to_latex() method, as mentioned before.

The typical subsetting operation in R with brackets is implemented to
select specific concepts from the lattice, giving their indexes or a
boolean vector indicating which concepts to keep. The same rules for
subsetting as in R base apply:

::: example
\> fc$concepts[c(1:3, 5, 8)]
A set of 5 concepts:
1: ({O1, O2, O3, O4}, {P2 [0.5], P4 [0.5]})
2: ({O1, O4}, {P2 [0.5], P3 [0.5], P4 [0.5]})
3: ({O1 [0.5], O4}, {P2 [0.5], P3, P4 [0.5]})
4: ({O1 [0.5], O4 [0.5]}, {P2, P3, P4})
5: ({}, {P1, P2, P3, P4})
\end{example}

In addition, the user can compute concepts' {\normalfont\textsl{support}} (the
proportion of objects whose set of attributes contains the intent of a
given concept) by means of \texorpdfstring%
{{\normalfont\ttfamily\hyphenchar\font=-1 fc\$concepts\$support()}}%
{fc\$concepts\$support()}.

\begin{example}
> fc$concepts$support()
[1] 1.00 0.50 0.25 0.50 0.00 0.50 0.00 0.00
\end{example}

\hypertarget{sublattices}{%
\subsubsection{Sublattices}\label{sublattices}}

When the concept lattice is too large, it can be useful to work with a
sublattice of the complete lattice on certain occasions. To this end, we
use the \texorpdfstring%
{{\normalfont\ttfamily\hyphenchar\font=-1 sublattice()}}%
{sublattice()} function.

For instance, to build the sublattice generated by the concepts
\(\ensuremath{\left(\ensuremath{\left\{{^{0.5}}\!/\mathrm{O1},\, {^{0.5}}\!/\mathrm{O4}\right\}}, \ensuremath{\left\{\mathrm{P2},\, \mathrm{P3},\, \mathrm{P4}\right\}}\right)}\)
and
\(\ensuremath{\left(\ensuremath{\left\{\mathrm{O2},\, \mathrm{O3}\right\}}, \ensuremath{\left\{{^{0.5}}\!/\mathrm{P1},\, \mathrm{P2},\, \mathrm{P4}\right\}}\right)}\),
which had indexes 5 and 6 in the list of concepts, we can do:

\begin{example}
> fc$concepts$sublattice(5:6)
A set of 4 concepts:
1: ({O1 [0.5], O2, O3, O4 [0.5]}, {P2, P4})
2: ({O1 [0.5], O4 [0.5]}, {P2, P3, P4})
3: ({O2, O3}, {P1 [0.5], P2, P4})
4: ({}, {P1, P2, P3, P4})
\end{example}

Some interesting sublattices appear when we consider only concepts
fulfilling a given condition (e.g., a minimum support), using a command
such as \texorpdfstring%

\hypertarget{subconcepts-superconcepts-infimum-and-supremum}{%
\subsubsection{Subconcepts, superconcepts, infimum and
supremum}\label{subconcepts-superconcepts-infimum-and-supremum}}

For a given concept \((A, B)\), we can find all its subconcepts
(\((C_i, D_i)\) such that \((C_i, D_i)\le (A, B)\)) by using the
\texorpdfstring%
{{\normalfont\ttfamily\hyphenchar\font=-1 subconcepts()}}%
{subconcepts()} functions. Analogously, the \texorpdfstring%
{{\normalfont\ttfamily\hyphenchar\font=-1 superconcepts()}}%
{superconcepts()}
function can be used to compute the set of \((C_i, D_i)\) such that
\((A, B) \le (C_i, D_i)\).

For instance, if we take a sample concept \(L=\)
\ensuremath{\left(\ensuremath{\left\{{^{0.5}}\!/\mathrm{O1},\, \mathrm{O2},\, \mathrm{O3},\, {^{0.5}}\!/\mathrm{O4}\right\}}, \ensuremath{\left\{\mathrm{P2},\, \mathrm{P4}\right\}}\right)}
, we can compute its subconcepts and superconcepts using:

\begin{example}
> fc$concepts$subconcepts(L)
A set of 5 concepts:
1: ({O1 [0.5], O2, O3, O4 [0.5]}, {P2, P4})
2: ({O1 [0.5], O4 [0.5]}, {P2, P3, P4})
3: ({O2, O3}, {P1 [0.5], P2, P4})
4: ({O2 [0.5], O3 [0.5]}, {P1, P2, P4})
5: ({}, {P1, P2, P3, P4})
> fc$concepts$superconcepts(L)
A set of 2 concepts:
1: ({O1, O2, O3, O4}, {P2 [0.5], P4 [0.5]})
2: ({O1 [0.5], O2, O3, O4 [0.5]}, {P2, P4})
\end{example}

Also, we can define the infimum and the supremum of a set of concepts as
the greatest common subconcept and the lowest common superconcept of all
the given concepts, respectively. For a list of concepts, we can compute
its infimum and supremum using the \texorpdfstring%
{{\normalfont\ttfamily\hyphenchar\font=-1 supremum()}}%
{supremum()} and
\texorpdfstring%
{{\normalfont\ttfamily\hyphenchar\font=-1 infimum()}}%
{infimum()} methods of the \texorpdfstring%
{{\normalfont\ttfamily\hyphenchar\font=-1 "ConceptLattice"}}%
{"ConceptLattice"} object. Additionally, irreducible elements in the lattice, with respect to join
(supremum) and meet (infimum), can be computed for a given concept
lattice with the methods \texorpdfstring%
{{\normalfont\ttfamily\hyphenchar\font=-1 join\_irreducibles()}}%
{join\_irreducibles()} and
\texorpdfstring%
{{\normalfont\ttfamily\hyphenchar\font=-1 meet\_irreducibles()}}%
{meet\_irreducibles()}.

\begin{example}
> fc$concepts$meet_irreducibles()
A set of 5 concepts:
1: ({O1, O4}, {P2 [0.5], P3 [0.5], P4 [0.5]})
2: ({O1 [0.5], O4}, {P2 [0.5], P3, P4 [0.5]})
3: ({O1 [0.5], O2, O3, O4 [0.5]}, {P2, P4})
4: ({O2, O3}, {P1 [0.5], P2, P4})
5: ({O2 [0.5], O3 [0.5]}, {P1, P2, P4})
> fc$concepts$join_irreducibles()
A set of 5 concepts:
1: ({O1, O4}, {P2 [0.5], P3 [0.5], P4 [0.5]})
2: ({O1 [0.5], O4}, {P2 [0.5], P3, P4 [0.5]})
3: ({O1 [0.5], O4 [0.5]}, {P2, P3, P4})
4: ({O2, O3}, {P1 [0.5], P2, P4})
5: ({O2 [0.5], O3 [0.5]}, {P1, P2, P4})
\end{example}

These irreducible elements are essential since they constitute the basic
elements with which the entire concept lattice can be reconstructed.

\hypertarget{the-standard-context}{%
\subsubsection{The standard context}\label{the-standard-context}}

The standard context has a concept lattice that is isomorphic to the one
of the original context, so it encapsulates the same knowledge. With
\texorpdfstring%
{{\normalfont\fontseries{b}\selectfont fcaR}}%
{fcaR} one can directly compute the standard context by using the
\texorpdfstring%
{{\normalfont\ttfamily\hyphenchar\font=-1 standardize()}}%
{standardize()} function, for example, using
\texorpdfstring%
{{\normalfont\ttfamily\hyphenchar\font=-1 fc\_std <-\ fc\$standardize()}}%
{fc\_std <-\ fc\$standardize()} to save the new context to another
variable.

This is a method that applies to a \texorpdfstring%
{{\normalfont\ttfamily\hyphenchar\font=-1 "FormalContext"}}%
{"FormalContext"} object, but is
closely related to its associated \texorpdfstring%
{{\normalfont\ttfamily\hyphenchar\font=-1 "ConceptLattice"}}%
{"ConceptLattice"}, since the
objects and attributes of the newly created standard context are the
meet- and join- irreducible elements of the concept lattice.

The standard context for the example in Table~\ref{tab:fc} and its
corresponding lattice are shown in Table~\ref{tab:std}.

\begin{table}

\begin{tabular}{cc}

\end{table}

\hypertarget{implications-and-logic-1}{%
\subsection{Implications and logic}\label{implications-and-logic-1}}

As mentioned earlier, a core problem in FCA is the computation of
implications that hold in a formal context. The iterative fuzzy version
of \textsc{NextClosure} has been implemented in C and made accessible
from \texorpdfstring%
{{\normalfont\fontseries{b}\selectfont fcaR}}%
{fcaR} thanks to an interface using \texorpdfstring%
{{\normalfont\fontseries{b}\selectfont Rcpp}}%
{Rcpp}. As we have
said, our package can manage classical implications from binary
datasets. In order to build the Duquenne-Guigues basis of implications,
by using the \textsc{NextClosure} algorithm, the command
\texorpdfstring%
{{\normalfont\ttfamily\hyphenchar\font=-1 fc\$find\_implications()}}%
{fc\$find\_implications()} is executed, and the result is stored in
\texorpdfstring%
{{\normalfont\ttfamily\hyphenchar\font=-1 fc\$implications}}%
{fc\$implications}.

The set of implications is stored as an object of class
\texorpdfstring%
{{\normalfont\ttfamily\hyphenchar\font=-1 "ImplicationSet"}}%
{"ImplicationSet"}, which can be inspected with the \texorpdfstring%
{{\normalfont\ttfamily\hyphenchar\font=-1 print()}}%
{print()}
method or simply with \texorpdfstring%
{{\normalfont\ttfamily\hyphenchar\font=-1 fc\$implications}}%
{fc\$implications}. In order to get a subset
of the implications by providing its indexes, the standard R subsetting
with \normalfont\texttt{[} will create another \texorpdfstring%
{{\normalfont\ttfamily\hyphenchar\font=-1 "ImplicationSet"}}%
{"ImplicationSet"} with exactly
the rules required. For instance, \texorpdfstring%
{{\normalfont\ttfamily\hyphenchar\font=-1 fc\$implications[1:3]}}%
{fc\$implications[1:3]} gives:

\begin{example}
Implication set with 3 implications.
Rule 1: {} -> {P2 [0.5], P4 [0.5]}
Rule 2: {P2 [0.5], P4} -> {P2}
Rule 3: {P2, P4 [0.5]} -> {P4}
\end{example}

These implications can be converted to \LaTeX~using the
\texorpdfstring%
{{\normalfont\ttfamily\hyphenchar\font=-1 to\_latex()}}%
{to\_latex()} method, giving:

\begingroup\footnotesize

\begin{longtable*}{rrcl}
1: &\ensuremath{\varnothing}&\ensuremath{\Rightarrow}&\ensuremath{\left\{{^{0.5}}\!/\mathrm{P2},\, {^{0.5}}\!/\mathrm{P4}\right\}}\\
2: &\ensuremath{\left\{{^{0.5}}\!/\mathrm{P2},\, \mathrm{P4}\right\}}&\ensuremath{\Rightarrow}&\ensuremath{\left\{\mathrm{P2}\right\}}\\
3: &\ensuremath{\left\{\mathrm{P2},\, {^{0.5}}\!/\mathrm{P4}\right\}}&\ensuremath{\Rightarrow}&\ensuremath{\left\{\mathrm{P4}\right\}}\\
\end{longtable*}\endgroup

On the other hand, one can \texorpdfstring%
{{\normalfont\ttfamily\hyphenchar\font=-1 filter()}}%
{filter()} the implications to retrieve
just those with specific attributes in the LHS and RHS. As before, the
method returns a new \texorpdfstring%
{{\normalfont\ttfamily\hyphenchar\font=-1 "ImplicationSet"}}%
{"ImplicationSet"} object. For example, to get the implications with attributes P1 and P2 in the
LHS and attribute P4 in the RHS, the user can execute
\texorpdfstring%
{{\normalfont\ttfamily\hyphenchar\font=-1 fc\$implications\$filter(lhs =\ c('P1',\ 'P2'),\ rhs =\ 'P4')}}%
{fc\$implications\$filter(lhs =\ c('P1',\ 'P2'),\ rhs =\ 'P4')}.

Some quantities can be computed from a set of implications:

\begin{itemize}
%
  \setlength{\itemsep}{0pt}\setlength{\parskip}{0pt}
\item
  {\normalfont\textsl{Cardinality}}, that is, the number of implications, with
  \texorpdfstring%
{{\normalfont\ttfamily\hyphenchar\font=-1 fc\$implications\$cardinality()}}%
{fc\$implications\$cardinality()}.
\item
  {\normalfont\textsl{Size}}, which is the cardinality of the LHS and RHS of
  \textit{each} implication, interpreted as fuzzy sets (thus non-integer
  sizes can appear): \texorpdfstring%
{{\normalfont\ttfamily\hyphenchar\font=-1 fc\$implications\$size()}}%
{fc\$implications\$size()}.
\item
  {\normalfont\textsl{Support}}, the proportion of objects in the formal context whose
  set of attributes is a \emph{superset} of the LHS of each implication:
  \texorpdfstring%
{{\normalfont\ttfamily\hyphenchar\font=-1 fc\$implications\$support()}}%
{fc\$implications\$support()}.
\end{itemize}

\clearpage

\hypertarget{application-of-the-simplification-logic}{%
\subsubsection{Application of the simplification
logic}\label{application-of-the-simplification-logic}}

In \texorpdfstring%
{{\normalfont\fontseries{b}\selectfont fcaR}}%
{fcaR}, the simplification logic has been implemented and made
accessible from an \texorpdfstring%
{{\normalfont\ttfamily\hyphenchar\font=-1 "ImplicationSet"}}%
{"ImplicationSet"} object through method
\texorpdfstring%
{{\normalfont\ttfamily\hyphenchar\font=-1 apply\_rules}}%
{apply\_rules}.

The list of equivalence rules applicable to an \texorpdfstring%
{{\normalfont\ttfamily\hyphenchar\font=-1 "ImplicationSet"}}%
{"ImplicationSet"}
is stored in a \texorpdfstring%
{{\normalfont\ttfamily\hyphenchar\font=-1 registry}}%
{registry} object from the \href{https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=registry}{\texorpdfstring%
{{\normalfont\fontseries{b}\selectfont registry}}%
{registry}}
package by \citet{registry}.

This registry is called \texorpdfstring%
{{\normalfont\ttfamily\hyphenchar\font=-1 equivalencesRegistry}}%
{equivalencesRegistry}, and one can inspect
its contents by using:

\begin{example}
> equivalencesRegistry$get_entry_names() \[1\] \"Composition\"
\"Generalization\" \"Reduction\" \[4\] \"Simplification\" \"Right
Simplification\" \"Reorder\"
:::

These names correspond to the methods added to the registry by default
and are used to index those methods. Every method is accompanied by a
description, so that we can see its definition:

::: example
\> equivalencesRegistry$get_entry('Composition')
     method Composition
        fun <<function>>
description A -> B and A -> C equivalent to A -> BC
\end{example}

We can even use abbreviated names to refer to the method. For instance,
we can use \normalfont\texttt{comp} instead of \normalfont\texttt{Composition} in the above
command to obtain the information about the composition rule.

The registry's use enables the user to extend the functionality provided
by the \texorpdfstring%
{{\normalfont\fontseries{b}\selectfont fcaR}}%
{fcaR} package. One can define and implement new equivalences
rules and add them to the registry, and make them available to the
\texorpdfstring%
{{\normalfont\ttfamily\hyphenchar\font=-1 apply\_rules()}}%
{apply\_rules()} method.

In order to add a new equivalence rule, we use the following:

\begin{example}
> equivalencesRegistry$set_entry(method = 'Method name', + fun =
method_function, + description = 'Method description')
:::

where method_function() is the R function that computes the
equivalences, and has the signature function(LHS, RHS, attributes),
where LHS and RHS are the sparse matrices defining the left-hand and
right-hand sides of the implications, attributes is the character vector
of attribute names, and returns the modified LHS and RHS. This mechanism
has been used in the package to implement additional equivalence rules.

The user can decide which rules to remove redundancies will be applied
and in which order:

::: example
\> fc$implications$apply_rules(rules = c('reduction', + 'comp', +
'gener', + 'simpl'))
:::

These methods can be applied to binary and fuzzy implications.

::: {#computation-of-closure-and-recommendations}
### Computation of closure and recommendations
:::

One of the primary uses of a set of implications extracted from a formal
context is computing the closure of a set of attributes, that is, the
fuzzy set obtained by applying the given implications on the set of
attributes.

The closure() method returns both the closure and the reduced
\"ImplicationSet\" if reduce = TRUE and only the closure if reduce =
FALSE (default). For instance, we can create a fuzzy set where the
attribute P2 is present with:

::: example
\> A \<- Set$new(attributes = fc$attributes, P2 = 1)
:::

Then, we can compute its closure and the reduced set of implications
doing:

::: example
\> fc$implications$closure(A, reduce = TRUE) $closure
{P2, P4}$implications Implication set with 2 implications. Rule 1: P3
\[0.5\] -\> P3 Rule 2: P1 \[0.5\], P3 -\> P1
:::

# Usage example. Fuzzy diagnostic system {#examples}

In this section, a complete example of the use of fcaR on real-world
problems is presented: Designing a diagnostic system from a formal
context with (fuzzy) medical data.

The dataset for this section is provided and documented in the package.

In this example, the aim is to build an automated system using the fcaR
package to perform medical diagnosis. We have focused on neurological
pathologies since, in recent years, an increasing number of initiatives
have appeared to share, curate, and study specific, prevalent brain
pathologies. Among these pathologies, schizophrenia is of the highest
interest, and public, curated repositories have been released.

The data source is SchizConnect [@wang2016schizconnect], an online data
repository integrating and mediating data from other
schizophrenia-related databases, such as COBRE [@aine2017multimodal],
which collect neuroimaging, psychological, neurological and clinical
information. SchizConnect allows retrieving data about the patients that
fulfil some conditions introduced as a query to the database. A subset
of the COBRE dataset has been retrieved by querying SchizConnect for 105
patients with neurological and clinical symptoms. We also collected
their corresponding diagnosis.

Among the clinical attributes in the dataset, one can find:

-   *Calgary Depression Scale for Schizophrenia*
    [@addington1990depression], nine items (attributes) assessing the
    level of depression in schizophrenia, differentiating between
    positive and negative aspects of the disease.

-   The *Simpson-Angus Scale* [@simpson1970rating], six items to
    evaluate Parkinsonism-like alterations related to schizophrenia in
    an individual.

-   The *Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-III-R Personality
    Disorders* [@first1997user], with nine variables related to the
    presence of signs affecting personality.

-   The diagnosis for each individual: it can be *schizophrenia strict*
    (abbreviated `dx_ss`) or *other diagnosis* (abbreviated `dx_other`,
    which includes schizoaffective and bipolar disorders). These
    diagnoses are mutually exclusive; thus, only one of them is assigned
    to each patient.

In summary, the dataset consists of the previous 30 attributes related
to signs or symptoms and two attributes related to diagnosis. So the
dataset has 105 objects (patients), and 32 attributes to explore. The
symptom attributes are multi-valued.

For a given attribute (symptom), the available grades are *absent*,
*minimal*, *mild*, *moderate*, *moderate severe*, *severe* and
*extreme*. Thus, taking into account these scale levels, the attributes
are coded as fuzzy and graded attributes with values 0, $\sfrac{1}{6}$,
$\sfrac{1}{3}$, $\sfrac{1}{2}$, $\sfrac{2}{3}$, $\sfrac{5}{6}$ and 1,
respectively. Since the symptom attributes are ordinal, for the sake of
simplicity, they have been encoded as grades in the interval $[0, 1]$,
just by mapping the lowest (*absent*) value to 0 and the greatest
(*extreme*) to 1 and placing the remaining values equidistantly in the
interval. In @ganter2016conceptual, other strategies of scaling for
ordinal, nominal, or interval attributes are presented.

In fcaR, this dataset is exposed to the user with the name cobre32, and
we can use it to create a fuzzy formal context (see
Figure [3](#fig:schizo){reference-type="ref" reference="fig:schizo"}):

![Formal context of the cobre32 dataset. The default plot type allows us
to identify patterns occurring in the attributes, such as the sparsity
of the SCIDII variables. Additionally, we can see that the variables
indicating diagnosis, dx_ss and dx_other in the last two columns, are
binary and mutually exclusive.](formal_context.pdf){#fig:schizo
width="0.7\\linewidth"}

Now, let us build a diagnosis system that employs the tacit knowledge
present in the formal context. The objective is to define a function
that takes a \"Set\" as input (with the clinical attributes of an
individual) and returns the degree of the diagnosis attributes using the
implications extracted from the formal context as an inference engine.

Next, we use the [NextClosure]{.smallcaps} algorithm to extract
implications and compute the set of concepts, using
fc\$find_implications().

The concept lattice is quite big (14706 concepts); therefore, it cannot
be plotted here for space and readability reasons. For this reason, we
only plot a sublattice of small size in
Figure [4](#fig:sublatticecobre32){reference-type="ref"
reference="fig:sublatticecobre32"}.

![Hasse diagram for a sublattice of the cobre32 formal context. Since
the complete concept lattice is huge, with the Hasse diagram of a
sublattice we can understand the relationship in a subset of the
attributes. In this case, we can see how variables COSAS_2 and FICAL_1
are related to the variable dx_ss which indicates the schizophrenia
diagnosis.](fig-sublatticecobre32.pdf){#fig:sublatticecobre32
width="0.6\\linewidth"}

There is an aggregate of 985 implications extracted. Let us compute the
average cardinality of the LHS and the RHS of the extracted rules:

::: example
\> colMeans(fc$implications$size()) LHS RHS 2.417597 1.954146
:::

Note that our paradigm can deal with non-unit implications, that is,
where there is more than one attribute in the RHS of the implication.
This feature is an extension of what is usual in other paradigms, for
example, in transactional databases.

We can use the *simplification logic* to remove redundancies and reduce
the LHS and RHS size of the implications. The reason to do this is to
decrease the computational cost of computing closures:

::: example
\> fc$implications$apply_rules(rules = c('simplification',
'rsimplification')) \> colMeans(fc$implications$size()) LHS RHS 1.998308
1.557191
:::

We can see that the average cardinality of the LHS has been reduced from
2.418 to 1.998 and that the one of the RHS, from 1.954 to 1.557.

With the simplified implication set, we can build a recommender system
by simply wrapping the recommend() method inside a function:

::: example
\> diagnose \<- function(S)  + + fc$implications$recommend(S = S, +
attribute_filter = + c('dx_ss', 'dx_other')) + +
:::

This function can be applied to \"Set\"s that have the same attributes
as those of the formal context. The attribute_filter argument specifies
which attributes are of interest, in our case, the diagnosis attributes.

Let us generate some sets of attributes and get the recommendation
(diagnosis) for each one:

::: example
\> S1 \<- Set$new(attributes = fc$attributes, + COSAS_1 = 1/2, COSAS_2 =
1, COSAS_3 = 1/2, + COSAS_4 = 1/6, COSAS_5 = 1/2, COSAS_6 = 1) \>
diagnose(S1) dx_ss dx_other 1 0 \> S2 \<-
Set$new(attributes = fc$attributes, + COSAS_2 = 1, COSAS_6 = 1, FICAL_1
= 1/3, FICAL_3 = 1/3) \> diagnose(S2) dx_ss dx_other 0 0 \> S3 \<-
Set$new(attributes = fc$attributes, + COSAS_4 = 2/3, FICAL_3 = 1/2,
FICAL_5 = 1/2, FICAL_8 = 1/2) \> diagnose(S3) dx_ss dx_other 0 1
:::

These results mean that, for S1, the recommended diagnosis is
schizophrenia strict, for S2 there is not enough information, and the
recommended diagnosis for S3 is *other*, different from schizophrenia
strict. For S2, maybe adding more attributes to it can help in obtaining
a diagnosis.

One can inspect the reduced set of implications obtained after computing
the closure for S2, simplify them and filter them to get the
implications that can be applied if more attribute values are known for
S2:

::: example
\> cl \<- fc$implications$closure(S2, reduce = TRUE) \>
cl$implications$apply_rules(c('simp', 'rsimp', 'reorder')) \>
cl$implications$filter(rhs = c('dx_ss', 'dx_other'), + not_lhs =
c('dx_ss', 'dx_other'), drop = TRUE) Implication set with 12
implications. Rule 1: FICAL_5 \[0.33\] -\> dx_other Rule 2: FICAL_6
\[0.33\], FICAL_8 \[0.33\] -\> dx_ss Rule 3: SCIDII_18 \[0.33\] -\>
dx_ss Rule 4: COSAS_1 \[0.5\], FICAL_8 \[0.33\] -\> dx_ss Rule 5:
SCIDII_20 \[0.33\] -\> dx_ss Rule 6: SCIDII_16 \[0.33\] -\> dx_ss Rule
7: SCIDII_12 \[0.33\] -\> dx_ss Rule 8: FICAL_7 \[0.33\] -\> dx_ss Rule
9: FICAL_6 \[0.33\], SCIDII_10 \[0.5\] -\> dx_ss Rule 10: COSAS_3
\[0.5\] -\> dx_ss Rule 11: COSAS_1 \[0.5\] -\> dx_ss Rule 12: SCIDII_10
\[0.5\] -\> dx_ss
:::

We can check that, for S2, if the presence of any symptom (of the LHS of
the implications) is verified, then the implications above could
directly tell us the diagnosis.

An extended version of the diagnosis system in this example has been
presented in @CORDERO2020113449, where the fcaR package has been used to
build a conversational recommender system based on fuzzy rules. In that
work, the recommender system designed with the help of fcaR has obtained
better results than those of the classical methods used in the area of
recommendations.

# Conclusions and future work {#conclusions}

This work aims to present the first R package implementing the core
methods in Formal Concept Analysis. This development aims to provide a
helpful tool for the FCA community and other fields where knowledge
discovery and retrieval play an essential role. Notably, the
hybridization of FCA with other Machine Learning techniques and its
application to data mining processes is well-known, making FCA an
appealing tool for knowledge discovery.

This package provides R6 classes and methods to manage datasets
presented as formal contexts, use the derivation operators, work with
the concepts (closed itemsets) or find and manage the basis of
implications. Additionally, the fcaR package implements a logic to infer
knowledge from sets of implications, allowing to compute closures and
therefore, it can be used as the engine to build recommender systems and
automated reasoning tools.

Another feature included in the package is providing graphical
visualisations of the concept lattice that condenses the extracted
knowledge.

The tool has been developed from two principles: *integration* with
other packages and *extensibility*. First, the arules package is a *de
facto* standard when working with transactional databases, closed
itemsets and association rules in R. Since FCA's perspective can be seen
as complementary to this, fcaR is able to import and export both the
datasets and the implications from/to the analogous classes defined in
arules. This way, the user of arules can benefit from the FCA tools in
fcaR, including the simplification logic.

The extensibility of the fcaR is guaranteed by its design philosophy.
First, the object-oriented programming paradigm allows extending the
classes and methods to other datatypes, other kinds of formal contexts,
or, for example, association rules. Second, using a registry for
equivalence rules makes it easy to include new logic tools in the
package's architecture without affecting existing code. Thus, users can
extend the package's functionality by incorporating their methods and
then testing and comparing them in a single framework.

Thus, fcaR implements a wide range of features. With the help of the
included documentation and the comprehensive vignettes, any user can
start analysing datasets with FCA tools quickly.

Regarding the low-level implementation, we have used sparse matrices as
the primary internal data structure of the package since they represent
a space- and cost-efficient storage. Also, when needed, the fcaR uses
parallel computing and C routines to increase efficiency and tackle
algorithmic bottlenecks.

As an example of use, we have used the implications extracted from a
dataset to develop a recommender system to help diagnose schizoaffective
disorders quickly.

The package is currently in stable development status. However, we
devise future extensions in terms of new or improved algorithms or as
new applications arise (in areas such as recommender systems,
unsupervised learning or text mining).

We emphasize that fcaR is having a great acceptance. At the time of
writing, it has now reached more than 20,000 downloads from CRAN.
