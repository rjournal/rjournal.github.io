title: Support Vector Machines for Survival Analysis with R
abstract: 'This article introduces the R package survivalsvm, implementing support
  vector machines for survival analysis. Three approaches are available in the package:
  The regression approach takes censoring into account when formulating the inequality
  constraints of the support vector problem. In the ranking approach, the inequality
  constraints set the objective to maximize the concordance index for comparable pairs
  of observations. The hybrid approach combines the regression and ranking constraints
  in a single model. We describe survival support vector machines and their implementation,
  provide examples and compare the prediction performance with the Cox proportional
  hazards model, random survival forests and gradient boosting using several real
  datasets. On these datasets, survival support vector machines perform on par with
  the reference methods.'
