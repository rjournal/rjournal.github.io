title: 'idmTPreg: Regression Model for Progressive Illness Death Data'
abstract: The progressive illness-death model is frequently used in medical applications.
  For example, the model may be used to describe the disease process in cancer studies.
  We have developed a new R package called idmTPreg to estimate regression coefficients
  in datasets that can be described by the progressive illness-death model. The motivation
  for the development of the package is a recent contribution that enables the estimation
  of possibly time-varying covariate effects on the transition probabilities for a
  progressive illness-death data. The main feature of the package is that it befits
  both non-Markov and Markov progressive illness-death data. The package implements
  the introduced estimators obtained using a direct binomial regression approach.
  Also, variance estimates and confidence bands are implemented in the package. This
  article presents guidelines for the use of the package.
