title: 'Fitting Tails by the Empirical Residual Coefficient of Variation: The ercv
  Package'
abstract: This article is a self-contained introduction to the R package ercv and
  to the methodology on which it is based through the analysis of nine examples. The
  methodology is simple and trustworthy for the analysis of extreme values and relates
  the two main existing methodologies. The package contains R functions for visualizing,
  fitting and validating the distribution of tails. It also provides multiple threshold
  tests for a generalized Pareto distribution, together with an automatic threshold
  selection algorithm.
