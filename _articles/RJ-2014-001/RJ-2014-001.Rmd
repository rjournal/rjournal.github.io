title: Taming PITCHf/x Data with XML2R and pitchRx
abstract: XML2R is a framework that reduces the effort required to transform XML content
  into tables in a way that preserves parent to child relationships. pitchRx applies
  XML2R’s grammar for XML manipulation to Major League Baseball Advanced Media (MLBAM)’s
  Gameday data. With pitchRx, one can easily obtain and store Gameday data in a remote
  database. The Gameday website hosts a wealth of XML data, but perhaps most interesting
  is PITCHf/x. Among other things, PITCHf/x data can be used to recreate a baseball’s
  flight path from a pitcher’s hand to home plate. With pitchRx, one can easily create
  animations and interactive 3D scatterplots of the baseball’s flight path. PITCHf/x
  data is also commonly used to generate a static plot of baseball locations at the
  moment they cross home plate. These plots, sometimes called strike-zone plots, can
  also refer to a plot of event probabilities over the same region. pitchRx provides
  an easy and robust way to generate strike-zone plots using the ggplot2 package.
