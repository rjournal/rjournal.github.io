title: 'Indoor Positioning and Fingerprinting: The R Package ipft'
abstract: Methods based on Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) fingerprinting
  are in the forefront among several techniques being proposed for indoor positioning.
  This paper introduces the R package ipft, which provides algorithms and utility
  functions for indoor positioning using fingerprinting techniques. These functions
  are designed for manipulation of RSSI fingerprint data sets, estimation of positions,
  comparison of the performance of different positioning models, and graphical visualization
  of data. Well-known machine learning algorithms are implemented in this package
  to perform analysis and estimations over RSSI data sets. The paper provides a description
  of these algorithms and functions, as well as examples of its use with real data.
  The ipft package provides a base that we hope to grow into a comprehensive library
  of fingerprinting-based indoor positioning methodologies.
