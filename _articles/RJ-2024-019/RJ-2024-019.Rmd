## Introduction {#sec:introduction}

In recent times, advancements in data acquisition techniques have made
it possible to collect data in high-resolution formats. Due to the
presence of temporal-spatial dependence, one may consider this type of
data as *functional data*. Functional Data Analysis (FDA) focuses on
developing statistical methodologies for analyzing data represented as
functions or curves. While FDA methods are particularly well-suited for
handling smooth continuum data, they can also be adapted and extended to
effectively analyze functional data that may not exhibit perfect
smoothness, including high-resolution data and data with inherent
variability. The widely-used [R]{.sans-serif} package for FDA is
[**fda**](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=fda) [@fdapackage], which
is designed to support analysis of functional data, as described in the
textbook by [@ramsay2005]. Additionally, there are over 40 other
[R]{.sans-serif} packages available on CRAN that incorporate functional
data analysis, such as
[**funFEM**](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=funFEM)
[@funFEMpackage],
[**fda.usc**](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=fda.usc)
[@fdauscpackage],
[**refund**](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=refund)
[@refundpackage],
[**fdapace**](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=fdapace)
[@fdapacepackage],
[**funData**](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=funData)
[@funDatapackage],
[**ftsspec**](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=ftsspec)
[@ftsspecpackage],
[**rainbow**](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=rainbow)
[@rainbowpackage], and
[**ftsa**](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=ftsa) [@ftsapackage].

One crucial initial requirement for any of these packages is to
establish a framework for representing and storing infinite-dimensional
functional observations. The
[**fda**](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=fda) package, for instance,
employs the `fd` class as a container for functional data defined on a
one-dimensional (1D) domain. An `fd` object represents functional data
as a finite linear combination of known basis functions (e.g., Fourier,
B-splines, etc.), storing both the basis functions and their respective
coefficients for each curve. This representation aligns with the
practical implementation found in many papers within the field of FDA.
Conversely, several other [R]{.sans-serif} packages store functional
data in a discrete form evaluated on grid points (e.g.,
[**fda.usc**](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=fda.usc),
[**refund**](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=refund),
[**funData**](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=funData),
[**rainbow**](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=rainbow), and
[**fdapace**](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=fdapace)). These
packages also provide the capability to analyze functions beyond the
one-dimensional case, such as image data treated as two-dimensional (2D)
functions (e.g.,
[**refund**](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=refund),
[**fdasrvf**](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=fdasrvf), and
[**funData**](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=funData)). To the best
of our knowledge, packages that support representation beyond 1D
functions utilize the grid point representation for execution and
storage. Moreover, recent packages have been developed to handle
multivariate functional data, which consist of more than one function
per observation unit. Examples of such packages include
[**roahd**](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=roahd),
[**fda.usc**](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=fda.usc), and
[**funData**](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=funData).

While some recent FDA packages have focused on analyzing and
implementing techniques for Functional Time Series (FTS), where
sequences of functions are observed over time, none of them handle
Multivariate FTS (MFTS) or multidimensional MFTS. For example see the
packages [**ftsspec**](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=ftsspec),
[**rainbow**](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=rainbow) and
[**ftsa**](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=ftsa). In summary, there
is still a need for a unified and flexible container for FTS/MFTS data,
defined on either one or multidimensional domains. The `funts` class in
[**Rfssa**](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=Rfssa) [@rfssapackage],
the package discussed in this article, aims to address this gap. One of
the primary contributions of the package is its capacity to handle and
visualize 2-dimensional FTS, including image data. Furthermore, the
package accommodates MFTS, especially when observed on distinct domains.
This flexibility empowers users to analyze and visualize FTS with
multiple variables, even when they do not share the same domain.
Notably, the [**Rfssa**](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=Rfssa)
package introduces novel visualization tools (as exemplified in Figure
\@ref(fig:figcall-center)). These tools include heatmaps and 3D plots,
thoughtfully designed to provide a deeper understanding of functional
patterns over time. They enhance the ability to discern trends and
variations that might remain inconspicuous in conventional plots. An
additional feature of the `funts` class is its ability to accept any
arbitrary basis system as input for the class constructor, including fda
basis functions or even empirical basis represented as matrices
evaluated at grid points. The classes in the
[**Rfssa**](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=Rfssa) package are
developed using the S3 object-oriented programming system, and for
computational efficiency, significant portions of the package are
implemented using the
[**Rcpp**](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=Rcpp)/[**RcppArmadillo**](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=RcppArmadillo)
packages. Notably, the package includes a shiny web application that
provides a user-friendly GUI for implementing Functional Singular
Spectrum Analysis (FSSA) on real or simulated FTS/MFTS data.

The [**Rfssa**](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=Rfssa) package was
initially developed to implement FSSA for FTS, as discussed in the work
of [@haghbin2021]. FSSA extends Singular Spectrum Analysis (SSA), a
model-free procedure commonly used to analyze time series data. The
primary goal of SSA is to decompose the original series into a
collection of interpretable components, such as slowly varying trends,
oscillatory patterns, and structureless noise. Notably, SSA does not
rely on restrictive assumptions like stationarity, linearity, or
normality [@golyandina2013]. It's worth noting that SSA finds
applications beyond the functional framework, including smoothing and
forecasting purposes [@hassani2013; @deCarvalho2017realtime]. The
non-functional version of FSSA, known as SSA, has previously been
implemented in the [**Rssa**](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=Rssa)
package [@rssapackage] and the
[**ASSA**](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=ASSA) package
[@ASSApackage]. The [**Rssa**](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=Rssa)
package provides various visualization tools to facilitate the grouping
stage, and the [**Rfssa**](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=Rfssa)
package includes equivalent functional versions of those tools
[@golyandina2018singular]. While the foundational theory of FSSA was
originally designed for univariate FTS, it has since been extended to
handle multidimensional FTS data, referred to as Multivariate FSSA
(MFSSA) [@trinka2022multivariate]. Furthermore, in line with the
developments in SSA for forecasting, two distinct algorithms known as
Recurrent Forecasting (FSSA R-forecasting) and Vector Forecasting (FSSA
V-forecasting) were introduced for FSSA by [@trinka2023functional]. Both
these forecasting algorithms, along with the capabilities for handling
MFSSA, have been seamlessly integrated into the most recent version of
the [**Rfssa**](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=Rfssa) package.

The remainder of this manuscript is organized as follows. Section 2
introduces the FTS/MFTS data preparation theory used in the `funts`
class. Section 3 discusses the FSSA methodology, including the basic
schema of FSSA, FSSA R-forecasting, and FSSA V-forecasting. Technical
details of the [**Rfssa**](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=Rfssa)
package are provided in Section 4, where we describe the available
classes in the package and illustrate their practical usage with
examples of real data. Section 5 focuses on the reconstruction stage and
FSSA/MFSSA forecasting. In Section 6, we provide a summary of the
embedded shiny app. Finally, we conclude the paper in Section 7.

## Data preparation in FTS {#sec:preparation}

Define $\textbf{y}_N=(y_1,\ldots,y_N)$ to be a collection of
observations from an FTS. In the theory of FTS, $y_i$'s are considered
as functions in the space $\mathbb{H}=L^2(\mathcal{T})$ where
$\mathcal{T}$ is a compact subset of $\mathbb{R}.$ Let $s\in\mathcal{T}$
and consider $y_i(s)\in\mathbb{R}^p$, the sequence of $\textbf{y}_N$ is
called (univariate) FTS if $p=1$, and multivariate FTS (or MFTS) if
$p>1.$ In the realm of functional data analysis, we operate under the
assumption that the underlying sample functions, denoted as
$y_{i}(\cdot)$, exhibit smoothness for each sample $i$, where
$i=1, \ldots, N$. Nevertheless, in practical scenarios, observations are
typically acquired discretely at a set of grid points and are
susceptible to contamination by random noise. This phenomenon can be
represented as follows:
$$\label{discr_data}
	Y_{i,k} = y_{i}(t_k) +\varepsilon_{i,k}, \quad k=1,\ldots, K.   (\#eq:discr-data)$$
In this expression, $t_k\in\mathcal{T}$, and $K$ denotes the count of
discrete grid points across all samples. The $\varepsilon_{i,k}$ terms
represent i.i.d random noises. To preprocess the raw data, it is
customary to employ smoothing techniques, converting the discrete
observations $Y_{i,k}$ into a continuous form, $y_{i}(\cdot)$. This is
typically performed individually for each variable and sample. One
widely used approach is finite basis function expansion [@ramsay2005].
In this method, a set of basis functions
$\left\lbrace \nu_i \right\rbrace_{ i\in\mathbb{N}}$ is considered (not
necessarily orthogonal) for the function space $\mathbb{H}$. Each sample
function $y_{i}(\cdot)$ in \@ref(eq:discr-data) is then considered as a
finite linear combination of the first $d$ basis functions:
$$\label{basis_expan}
	y_i(s)= \sum_{j=1}^d c_{ij}\nu_j(s).   (\#eq:basis-expan)$$
Subsequently, the coefficients $c_{ij}$ can be estimated using least
square techniques. By adopting the linear representation form for the
functional data in \@ref(eq:basis-expan), we establish a correspondence
between each function $y_i(\cdot)$ and its coefficient vector
${\pmb c}_i=(c_{ij})_{j=1}^d.$ As a result, the coefficient vectors
${\pmb c}_i$ can serve to store and retrieve the original functions,
$y_i(\cdot)$'s. This arises from the inherent isomorphism between two
finite vector spaces of the same dimension (in this case, $d$).
Consequently, ${\pmb c}_i$'s are stored as the primary attribute of
`funts` objects within the
[**Rfssa**](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=Rfssa) package. Take two
elements $x, y\in \mathbb{H}$ with corresponding coefficient vectors
${\pmb c}_x$ and ${\pmb c}_y.$ Then, the inner product of $x, y$ can be
computed in matrix form as
$\langle x,y \rangle={\pmb c}_x^\top \mathbf{G} {\pmb c}_y$, where
$\mathbf{G}=[ \langle \nu_i,\nu_j \rangle ]_{i,j=1}^{d}$ is the Gram
matrix. It is important to note that $\mathbf{G}$ is Hermitian.
Furthermore, because the basis functions $\{\nu_i\}_{i=1}^d$ are
linearly independent, $\mathbf{G}$ is positive definite, making it
invertible [@horn2012matrix Thm. 7.2.10]. Moreover, let
$A:\mathbb{H}\rightarrow \mathbb{H}$ be a linear operator and $y=A(x).$
Then, ${\pmb c}_y= \mathbf{G}^{-1}\mathbf{A}{\pmb c}_x,$ where
$\mathbf{A}=[ \langle A(\nu_j),\nu_i \rangle ]_{i,j=1}^{d}$ is called
the corresponding matrix of the operator $A.$

It is worth noting that while the FSSA theory extends to arbitrary
dimensions, practical implementation for dimensions greater than $2$
introduces considerable computational complexity. Moreover,
high-dimensional FTS data are relatively rare in real-world
applications. Therefore, within the
[**Rfssa**](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=Rfssa) package, we have
chosen to confine the `funts` object to support functions observed over
domains that are one or two-dimensional. In the
[**Rfssa**](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=Rfssa) package, the task
of preprocessing the raw discrete observations and converting those to
the `funts` object is assigned to the `funts(`$\cdot$`)` constructor.

## An overview of the FSSA methodology {#sec:methodology}

FSSA is a nonparametric technique to decompose FTS and MFTS and the
methodology can also be used to forecast such data
[@haghbin2021; @trinka2022multivariate; @trinka2023functional]; it can
also be used as a visualization tool to illustrate the concept of
seasonality and periodicity in the functional space over time.

### Basic schema of FSSA

Basic FSSA consists of two stages where each stage includes two steps.
We outline the four steps of the FSSA algorithm here.

-   **First stage: decomposition**

    -   *Embedding*\
        For a positive integer, $L<N/2$, let $\mathbb{H}^L$ be the
        Cartesian product of $L$ copies of $\mathbb{H}$ and define the
        *trajectory* operator
        $\mathbfcal{X}:\mathbb{R}^{K} \rightarrow \mathbb{H}^{L}$ with
        $$\label{trajectory}
        		\mathbfcal{X}{\pmb a}:=\sum_{j=1}^K a_j{\pmb x}_j,\qquad
        		\ {\pmb a}=\left(a_1,\ldots, a_K\right)^\top \in\mathbb{R}^K.   (\#eq:trajectory)$$

        where $K=N-L+1$ and
        $$\label{flvec}
        		{\pmb x}_j(s):= \left( y_j(s), y_{j+1}(s), \ldots, y_{j+L-1}(s)\right)^\top,\ j=1,\ldots, K,   (\#eq:flvec)$$
        are called *lag-vectors*. One may consider the trajectory
        operator $\mathbfcal{X}$ in \@ref(eq:trajectory) as an
        $L \times K$ matrix with functional entries in the form of
        $$\label{eqn:hankelmat}
        		\mathbfcal{X}(s) = \begin{bmatrix}y_{1}(s) & y_{2}(s) & y_{3}(s) & \cdots & y_{K}(s) \\ y_{2}(s) & y_{3}(s) & y_{4}(s) & \cdots & y_{K+1}(s) \\ y_{3}(s) & y_{4}(s) & y_{5}(s) & \cdots & y_{K+2}(s) \\ \vdots  & \vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\ y_{L}(s) & y_{L+1}(s) & y_{L+2}(s) & \cdots & y_{N}(s)  \end{bmatrix}.   (\#eq:eqnhankelmat)$$

        Note that the antidiagonal elements of the matrix in
        \@ref(eq:eqnhankelmat) are all equal. Such matrices are called
        Hankel, and since $\mathbfcal{X}(s)$ is a Hankel matrix for any
        $s$ in the domain, we call $\mathbfcal{X}$ a Hankel operator. In
        practice, a main challenge is how to use the original basis of
        $\mathbb{H}$ to represent the lag-vectors in $\mathbb{H}^L$. To
        do this, one may define a quotient sequence $q_k$, and a
        reminder sequence $r_k$, by $k=(q_k-1)L+r_k,$ where
        $1\leq r_k\leq L$, and $1\leq q_k\leq d$. Now, consider
        ${\pmb \phi}_{k}$ as a functional vector of length $L$ with all
        zero functions, except $r_k$-th element, which is $\nu_{q_k}$.
        Using this definition, the lag-vector ${\pmb{x}_j}$ given in
        \@ref(eq:flvec) can be represented as a linear combination of
        $\{{\pmb \phi}_{k}\}_{k=1}^{Ld}$ with the corresponding
        coefficient vector
        ${\bf b}_j=(c_{1j},\ldots, c_{1,j+L-1},c_{2j},\ldots,c_{2,j+L-1},\ldots,c_{d,j+L-1} )^\top.$

    -   *FSVD*\
        We apply the functional singular value decomposition (FSVD) to
        $\mathbfcal{X}$ and obtain a collection of singular values,
        $\{\sqrt{\lambda_i}\}_{i=1}^{r}$, orthonormal right singular
        vectors $\{\mathbf{v}_{i}\}_{i=1}^{r}$ (that are elements of
        $\mathbb{R}^{K}$), and orthonormal left singular functions
        $\{\pmb{\psi}_{i}\}_{i=1}^{r}$ (that are elements of
        $\mathbb{H}^{L}$). The collection
        $(\sqrt{\lambda_i}, \pmb{\psi}_i, \mathbf{v}_i)$ will be called
        the $i^{th}$ eigentriple of the FSVD, and $r$ is the rank of
        $\mathbfcal{X}$:
        $$\label{FSVD}
        		\mathbfcal{X} = \sum_{i=1}^{r} \mathbfcal{X}_{i} = \sum_{i=1}^{r} \sqrt{\lambda_i} \mathbf{v}_{i} \otimes \pmb{\psi}_{i},   (\#eq:FSVD)$$
        where
        $\mathbfcal{X}_{i}:\mathbb{R}^{K} \rightarrow \mathbb{H}^{L}$ is
        a rank one elementary operator. To implement the FSVD of
        $\mathbfcal{X}$ given in \@ref(eq:FSVD), let
        ${\bf B}:=[{\bf b}_1,\cdots,{\bf b}_K]$,
        $\mathbf{G}:=[ \langle {\pmb \phi}_{i}, {\pmb \phi}_{j} \rangle_{\mathbb{H}^L}]_{i,j=1}^{Ld}$,
        $\mathbf{X}:=\mathbf{G}^{1/2}\mathbf{B}$, and
        $\left(\sqrt{\lambda_i}, \pmb{u}_i, \mathbf{v}_i\right)$'s be
        the eigentriples of the SVD of the matrix $\mathbf{X}$. It can
        be shown that
        $\left(\sqrt{\lambda_i},\pmb{\psi}_i,\mathbf{v}_i \right)$ is
        the $i^{th}$ eigentriple of the FSVD of $\mathbfcal{X}$, where
        the left singular function, ${\pmb \psi}_i$, is corresponding to
        the coefficient vector $\mathbf{G}^{-1/2}{\pmb u}_i$. See
        [@haghbin2021] for more details.

    These steps can also be extended to multivariate case, i.e. MFSSA.
    See [@trinka2022multivariate] for more details. In the
    [**Rfssa**](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=Rfssa) package, the
    results of the decomposition stage is held in an object from the
    `fssa` class. The constructor, `fssa(`$\cdot$`)`, performs the
    decomposition for both FSSA and MFSSA algorithm and returns an
    object of class `fssa`. Further discussion about the attributes and
    methods of the `fssa` class is given in the technical details
    section.

-   **Second stage: reconstruction**

    -   *Grouping*\
        We partition the set of indices $\{1,\dots,r\}$ into disjoint
        sets $I_{q}$, where $q \in \{1,\dots, m\}$ and $m\leq r$. From
        here, we obtain the group $\mathbfcal{X}_{I_{q}}$ by combining
        the respective elementary operators accordingly:
        $$\mathbfcal{X}_{I_{q}} = \sum_{i \in I_{q}} \mathbfcal{X}_{i}. \nonumber$$
        Exploratory plots of singular values, right singular vectors,
        and left singular functions that investigate the different modes
        of variation extracted in the decomposition stage are used to
        decide how to form the sets, $I_{q}$, and we discuss such plots
        in further detail in section five.

    -   *Hankelization*\
        Since each $\mathbfcal{X}_{I_{q}}$ is not necessarily Hankel, we
        perform diagonal averaging of the entries to Hankelize each
        operator. From each Hankelized $\mathbfcal{X}_{I_{q}}$, we
        obtain an FTS, $\mathbf{y}_{N}^{q}$, that describes main
        characteristics of $\mathbf{y}_{N}$ such as mean, seasonal,
        trend, and noise behaviors.

    For the reconstruction stage, the
    [**Rfssa**](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=Rfssa) package
    provides the function `freconstruct(`$\cdot$`)` which returns a list
    of objects of class `funts` associated to the groups specified by
    the user. If the supplied input to the `fssa(`$\cdot$`)` function is
    an MFTS, the signal extraction process is almost identical as
    compared to the univariate case with the exception that now, we have
    that each element of the time series is a tuple of functions
    comprised of elements observed over one or two-dimensional domains.

```{r figrecon-call, echo=FALSE , fig.cap="(A): Line plot of Callcenter data; (B): FTS reconstructed using $I_{\\mathfrak{s}} = \\{1,\\cdots,7\\}$; (C): FTS reconstructed by setting $I_{1}=\\{1\\}$; (D): FTS reconstructed using $I_{2} = \\{2,3\\}$; (E): FTS reconstructed from $I_{3}=\\{4,5\\}$; (F): FTS reconstructed from $I_{4}=\\{6,7\\}$.", fig.alt="graphic without alt text", fig.show='hold', fig.align="center", out.width="32900%"}
knitr::include_graphics(c("figures/call_3.png","figures/call_4.png","figures/call_5.png","figures/call_6.png","figures/call_7.png","figures/call_8.png"))
```

As a motivating example, consider the `Callcenter` dataset Figure
\@ref(fig:figrecon-call)(A), which has been previously discussed in
[@maadooliat2015integrating] and is included in the package. This
dataset records the number of calls received by a call center in 1999.
Each functional observation corresponds to the square root of the daily
call count, and the entire FTS represents all the days in 1999. When
dealing with time series data exhibiting known periodic patterns, it is
a common practice in SSA to choose the window length, $L$, as a multiple
of this underlying periodicity. This choice ensures that the method
effectively extracts the corresponding periodic components
[@golyandina2001]. For our illustrative example using the `Callcenter`
dataset, we specifically opt for a window length of $L=28$. This
selection allows us to effectively capture the weekly periodic patterns
that inherently exist within this functional time series [@haghbin2021].
After applying FSSA, we obtain reconstructed FTS representations under
different grouping considerations, as illustrated in Figures
\@ref(fig:figrecon-call)(B-F). Particularly noteworthy is the
reconstructed FTS obtained using the leading 7 eigentriples of the FSVD,
as shown in Figure \@ref(fig:figrecon-call)(B). It is important to
mention that the selection of groups in FTS is typically guided by
various SSA-type plotting tools, which rely on the similarity in the
harmonic structure of extracted elementary components. Such SSA-type
plots have been available for non-functional time series in the
[**Rssa**](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=Rssa) package, and
analogous tools for the functional case have been developed in
[**Rfssa**](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=Rfssa) (Figure
\@ref(fig:figcall-decomp)). However, it's worth noting that this
extension presented its own set of challenges, both in theory and
implementation. Detailed code for generating the reconstructed functions

### FSSA Forecasting {#subsec:forecast}

After the decomposition stage, one may perform forecasting instead of
reconstruction (Figure \@ref(fig:figroadpap)). R-forecasting and
V-forecasting are two main defined approaches in FSSA/MFSSA
[@trinka2023functional]. In both forecasting methods, the goal is to
obtain the FTS,
$\mathbf{g}_{N+M}^{q}=\left(g_{1}^{q},\dots,g_{N+M}^{q}\right)$, where
the first $N$ terms are close to $\mathbf{y}_{N}^{q}$ and the goal is to
forecast the remaining elements, $\{g_{i}^{q}\}_{i=N+1}^{N+M}$.

Forecasts in the R-forecasting method, are obtained using a linear
combination of the previous $L-1$ elements of $\mathbf{g}_{N+M}^{q}$.
Consider a positive integer $k<r$ and define
$\mathbfcal{V} = \sum_{i=1}^{k} \pi_{i} \otimes \pi_{i}$, where
$\pi_{i} \in \mathbb{H}$ is the last element of left singular function
$\pmb{\psi}_{i}$. Define
$\mathbfcal{A}_{j}: \mathbb{H} \rightarrow \mathbb{H}$ such that
$\mathbfcal{A}_{j} = \sum_{i=1}^{k}\psi_{j,i} \otimes \left(\mathbfcal{I} - \mathbfcal{V}\right)^{-1}\pi_{i}$,
where $\psi_{j,i}$ is the $j^{\text{th}}$ component of $\pmb{\psi}_{i}$,
and $\mathbfcal{I}:\mathbb{H} \rightarrow \mathbb{H}$ is the identity
operator. Then the R-forecasting can be obtained using following
equation
$$g_{i}^{q}=\begin{cases} 
		y_{i}^{q}, & i=1,\dots,N \\
		\sum_{j=1}^{L-1}\mathbfcal{A}_{j}g_{i+j-L}^{q}, & i=N+1,\dots,N+M.
	\end{cases}$$

Forecasts in the V-forecasting method, are obtained by predicting
functional vectors. One may define an orthogonal projection,
$\pmb{\Pi}:\mathbb{H}^{L-1} \rightarrow \mathbb{H}^{L-1}$, that projects
onto the space spanned by $\{\pmb{\psi}_{i}^{\nabla}\}_{i=1}^{k}$, where
$\pmb{\psi}_{i}^{\nabla} \in \mathbb{H}^{L-1}$ is formed from the first
$L-1$ elements of $\pmb{\psi}_{i}$. Now let
$\mathbfcal{Q}:\mathbb{H}^{L} \rightarrow \mathbb{H}^{L}$ be given by
$$\mathbfcal{Q}\left(\pmb{x}\right)=\begin{pmatrix} \pmb{\Pi}\left(\pmb{x}^{\Delta}\right) \\ \sum_{j=1}^{L-1}\mathbfcal{A}_{j}x^{\Delta}_{j}\end{pmatrix}, \qquad {\pmb{x}} \in \mathbb{H}^{L} \nonumber,$$
where $\pmb{x}^{\Delta}$ contains the last $L-1$ components of
$\pmb{x}$, and $x_{j}^{\Delta}$ is the $j^{\text{th}}$ component of
$\pmb{x}^{\Delta}$. The V-forecasting algorithm is given in the
following steps:

1.  Define $\pmb{w}^{q}_{j}$ as
    $$\pmb{w}^{q}_{j}= \begin{cases} 
          \pmb{x}^{q}_{j}, & j=1,\dots, K \\
         \mathbfcal{Q}\pmb{w}^{q}_{j-1}, & j=K+1, \dots, K+M,
       \end{cases}$$
    where $\{\pmb{x}^{q}_{j}\}_{j=1}^{K}$ spans the range of operator
    $\mathbfcal{X}_{I_{q}}$.

2.  Form the operator
    $\mathbfcal{W}^q:\mathbb{R}^{K+M} \rightarrow \mathbb{H}^{L}$ whose
    range is linearly spanned by the set
    $\{\pmb{w}_{i}^q\}_{i=1}^{K+M}$.

3.  Hankelize $\mathbfcal{W}^q$ in order to extract the FTS
    $\mathbf{g}^{q}_{N+M}$.

4.  The functions, $g^{q}_{N+1}, \dots, g^{q}_{N+M}$, form the $M$ terms
    of the FSSA vector forecast.

Continuing from the previous example, we utilized the first 358 days of
the year to train the FSSA model on the `Callcenter` dataset.
Subsequently, we employed the FSSA R-forecasting and V-forecasting
methods to make predictions for the final week ($len = 7$). Figure
\@ref(fig:figfor-call) illustrates both the actual and forecasted curves
for each day of the week, employing each respective method. Detailed
code for this process can be found in the subsequent sections.

In the [**Rfssa**](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=Rfssa) package, we
offer the `fforecast(`$\cdot$`)` function designed for the execution of
R-forecasting or V-forecasting algorithms. This function expects an
input argument of class `fssa` and yields an output of class
`fforecast`. The latter comprises a list of objects of class `funts`,
with each `funts` representing a forecasted group.

## Technical details of the Rfssa package {#sec:Technical}

The roadmap of the main functions used in the
[**Rfssa**](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=Rfssa) package is given
in Figure \@ref(fig:figroadpap). The inputs and outputs of these
functions are described in Table \@ref(tab:1). As it can be seen from
Table \@ref(tab:1), three classes (`funts`, `fssa` and `fforecast`) are
used to support the return objects of theses functions. The
`funts(`$\cdot$`)`, `fssa(`$\cdot$`)` and `fforecast(`$\cdot$`)`
functions are the constructors of the `funts`, `fssa` and `fforecast`
classes, respectively. In the rest of this section we present these
classes with illustrative examples, and later we describe the
reconstruction and forecasting functions in details.

### The `funts` class {#subsec:fts}

The `funts(`$\cdot$`)` constructor is used to create an `S3` object of
class `funts`. This object is designed to encapsulate various forms of
FTS, including both univariate and multivariate types. It offers a
versatile framework for the creation and manipulation of `funts`
objects, accommodating different basis systems and dimensions. It
accepts the following arguments:

-   `X`: A matrix, three-dimensional array, or a list of matrix or array
    objects. When `method="data"`, it represents the observed curve
    values at discrete sampling points or argument values. When
    `method="coefs"`, `X` specifies the coefficients corresponding to
    the basis system defined in `basisobj`. If `X` is a list, it defines
    a multivariate FTS, with each element being a matrix or
    three-dimensional array object. In matrix objects, rows correspond
    to argument values, and columns correspond to the length of the FTS.
    In three-dimensional array objects, the first and second dimensions
    correspond to argument values, and the third dimension to the length
    of the FTS.

-   `basisobj`: This argument should be an object of class `basisfd`, a
    matrix of empirical basis, or a list of `basisfd` or empirical basis
    objects. In the case of empirical basis, rows correspond to basis
    functions, and columns correspond to grid points.

-   `argval`: A vector list of length `p`, representing a set of
    argument values corresponding to the observations in `X`. Each entry
    in this list should either be a numeric value or a list of numeric
    elements, depending on the dimension of the domain over which the
    variable is observed. It's worth noting that these values can vary
    from one variable to another. If `argval` is set to `NULL`, the
    default values are the integers from 1 to *n*, where *n* is the size
    of the first dimension in the `X` argument.

-   `method`: This parameter determines the type of the `X` matrix, and
    it can take one of two values: `coefs` or `data`.

-   `start` and `end`: Specify time of the first and last observations.
    They can be a single positive integer or an object of classes
    `Date`, `POSIXct`, or `POSIXt`, representing a natural time unit.

-   `tname`, `vnames` and `dnames`: These parameters accept strings or
    lists of strings to specify the names of time, variables, and
    domains.

The `funts(`$\cdot$`)` constructor offers flexibility to users. Users
can either provide their custom basis or request
[**Rfssa**](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=Rfssa) to generate the
basis for them, leveraging the capabilities of the
[**fda**](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=fda) package. It is assumed
that each variable is observed over a regular and equidistant grid.
Furthermore, each variable in the `funts` object is assumed to be
observed over either a one or two-dimensional domain, as illustrated in
Figure \@ref(fig:figfts). To enhance the representation of time, the
`funts` function introduces two parameters, namely `start` and `end`,
which capture the time series duration. This design allows users to
specify time information in a structured and standardized manner. Users
have the flexibility to set `start` and `end` using various time and
date classes, such as `Date`, `POSIXct`, or `POSIXt`. If users do not
provide the `start` and `end` arguments, default values are used, with
`start=1` and `end=N`, where $N$ represents the length of the time
series. This default approach aligns with common practices, as seen in
classes like `ts` in the
[**stats**](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=stats) package, as well
as `fts` classes in
[**rainbow**](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=rainbow) or
[**ftsa**](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=ftsa). An object of class
`funts` is a list encompassing the following elements:

1.  `N`: Represents the length of the time series.

2.  `dimSupp`: A list specifying the dimensions of the support domain of
    the variables.

3.  `time`: The time object.

4.  `coefs`: A list containing basis coefficients.

5.  `basis`: A list of basis systems.

6.  `B_mat`: Evaluated basis functions on initial arguments.

7.  `argval`: Initial arguments of the observed functions.

```{r figfts, echo=FALSE , fig.cap="The main roadmap of funts objects. ", fig.alt="graphic without alt text", fig.show='hold', fig.align="center", out.width="90.0%"}
knitr::include_graphics(c("figures/fts.png"))
```

The `funts` class provides essential functionalities for managing FTS
objects, ensuring users have well-defined basic operations. It supports
arithmetic operations like addition and multiplication, along with
indexing methods. Additionally, three generic methods,
`length(`$\cdot$`)`, `print(`$\cdot$`)`, and `plot(`$\cdot$`)`, are
available. The `eval.funts(`$\cdot$`)` method allows users to evaluate a
`funts` object on a specified grid. To determine if an object belongs to
the `funts` class, the `is.funts(`$\cdot$`)` method is provided.
Converting objects from the
[**fda**](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=fda) package's `fd` class
or the [**rainbow**](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=rainbow)
package's `fts` class to a `funts` object is made easy using the
`as.funts(`$\cdot$`)` function. The strength of `funts` objects lies in
their powerful visualization capabilities within the field of FTS. Users
can create two types of plots using the graphical commands
`plot(`$\cdot$`)` and `plotly_funts(`$\cdot$`)`. The `plot(`$\cdot$`)`
method utilizes base graphics objects to generate FTS plots. On the
other hand, the `plotly_funts(`$\cdot$`)` function offers a versatile
[**plotly**](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=plotly) platform for
visualizing FTS data, providing several plot types: `line`, `3Dline`,
`3Dsurface`, and `heatmap`. These plots making it easier to detect
trends or patterns within each curve's behavior over time. Furthermore,
users can directly apply `plotly_funts(`$\cdot$`)` function to objects
from the `fd`, `fds`, or `fts` classes in packages like
[**rainbow**](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=rainbow),
[**fds**](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=fds),
[**ftsa**](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=ftsa), or
[**fda**](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=fda), without the need for
conversion to `funts` objects. Additionally, when converting objects
from packages like `fds` or `fts`, the `xname` and `yname` arguments are
automatically captured and used as the `xlab` and `zlab` arguments,
ensuring that resulting plots are informative and intuitive.

To demonstrate the capabilities of the
[**Rfssa**](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=Rfssa) package for
handling FTS, two illustrative examples are provided. The first example
showcases the `Callcenter` dataset consisting of curves observed over a
one-dimensional domain. In contrast, the second example involves a
bivariate FTS dataset, which includes a sequence of two types of remote
sensing images (two-dimensional functional data domain).

#### Example: Creating `funts` objects for FTS

The first example uses the raw `Callcenter` dataset which was discussed
before. The `funts` object can be made and plotted using the following
codes. The generated plots are shown in Figure
\@ref(fig:figcall-center).

``` r
# Load necessary libraries
require(Rfssa)
require(fda)

# Load Callcenter data
Call_data <- loadCallcenterData()

# Prepare the data
D <- matrix(sqrt(Call_data$calls)), nrow = 240)
bs1 <- create.bspline.basis(c(0, 23), 22)

# Create a 'funts' object 
Call_funts <- funts(D, bs1, start = as.Date("1999-1-1"),
	vnames = "Sqrt of Call Numbers",
	dnames = "Time (6 minutes aggregated)",
	tname = "Date")

xtlab <- list(c("00:00", "06:00", "12:00", "18:00", "24:00"))
xtloc <- list(c(1, 60, 120, 180, 240))

# Generate a line plot using Plotly
plotly_funts(Call_funts, main = "Call Center Data Line Plot",
	xticklabels = xtlab, xticklocs = xtloc)

# Generate a heatmap plot using Plotly
plotly_funts(Call_funts, type = "heatmap", main = "Call Center Data Heatmap",
	xticklabels = xtlab, xticklocs = xtloc)

# Generate a 3D line plot using Plotly
plotly_funts(Call_funts, type = "3Dline", main = "Call Center Data 3Dline plot",
	xticklabels = xtlab, xticklocs = xtloc
)

# Generate a 3D surface plot using Plotly
plotly_funts(Call_funts, type = "3Dsurface", main = "Call Center Data 3Dsurface plot",
	xticklabels = xtlab, xticklocs = xtloc
)
```

```{r figcall-center, echo=FALSE , fig.cap="The plot types of the generated plots by plotly_funts($\\cdot$)", fig.alt="graphic without alt text",fig.show='hold', fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics(c("figures/call_1.png", "figures/call_2.png", "figures/3Dline.png", "figures/3Dsurface.png"))
```

As one can be see from Figure \@ref(fig:figcall-center)(A), the
overlapping line plot is a common way to view FTS data observed over a
one-dimensional domain, where the curves that are recorded on dates
closer to the start of 1999 are given in light blue while functions
obtained on later dates are plotted in a darker blue. The heatmap plot
in Figure \@ref(fig:figcall-center)(B) is a newer technique used to
visualize FTS data observed over a one-dimensional domain, allowing the
user to see the evolution of the FTS over time as opposed to relying on
different colorings of the curves to specify date. Such one-dimensional
FTS can also be represented in a interactive 3D view. To obtain such
plots the user simply needs to specify `type="3Dsurface"` or
`type="3Dline"`.

#### Example: Creating `funts` objects for MFTS

The second example considered two collection of images where each image
is drawn from a region southeast of the city of Jambi, Indonesia located
between latitudes of $1.666792^{\circ}$ S - $1.598042^{\circ}$ S and
longitudes of $103.608963^{\circ}$ E - $103.677742^{\circ}$ E. The
images were recorded using the MODerate Resolution Imaging
Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Terra satellite with a resolution of 250
meters every 16 days starting from February 18, 2000 and ending July 28,
2019. The output of each image is the normalized difference vegetation
index (NDVI) which is used to quantify how much vegetation is present
and enhanced vegetation index (EVI). The NDVI values closer to one being
indicative of more vegetation and values closer to zero indicate less
vegetation [see @haghbin2021 for more details]. The following code can
be used to load the data, define a `funts` object for a MFTS, slice the
`funts` object to select a specific variable (here NDVI), and plot the
smoothed images over time in an animation, that a snapshot is given in
Figure \@ref(fig:figndvi-image).

```{r figndvi-image, echo=FALSE , fig.cap="An NDVI snapshot from the city of Jambi, Indonesia.", fig.alt="graphic without alt text", fig.show='hold', fig.align="center", out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics(c("figures/ndvi.png"))
```

``` r
# Load the Jambi dataset
Jambi <- loadJambiData()

# Extract NDVI and EVI array data 
NDVI <- Jambi$NDVI
EVI <- (Jambi$EVI)

# Create a list containing NDVI and EVI array data
Jambi_Data <- list(NDVI, EVI)

# Create a multivariate B-spline basis
require(fda)
bs2 <- create.bspline.basis(c(0, 1), 13)
bs2d <- list(bs2, bs2)
bsmv <- list(bs2d, bs2d)

# Create a funts object
Y_J <- funts(X = Jambi_Data,
	basisobj = bsmv,
	start = as.Date("2000-02-18"), end = as.Date("2019-07-28"),
	vnames = c("NDVI", "EVI"), tname = "Date",
	dnames = list(c("Latitude", "Longitude"), c("Latitude", "Longitude")))

# Create a Plotly-based visualization of the NDVI Image
plotly_funts(Y_J[, 1],
	main = "NDVI Image (Jambi)",
	xticklabels = list(c("103.61\u00B0 E", "103.68\u00B0 E")),
	yticklabels = list(c("1.67\u00B0 S", "1.60\u00B0 S")),
	xticklocs = list(c(0, 1)),
	yticklocs = list(c(0, 1)),
	color_palette = "RdYlGn")
```

### The `fssa` Class {#subsec:fssa}

Once the `funts` object is created and $L$ is chosen, one can apply the
`fssa(`$\cdot$`)` constructor to obtain an `S3` object of class `fssa`
that contains our singular values, left singular functions, and right
singular vectors. An object of class `fssa` is a list of right singular
functions, which is packed in an object of class `funts` and the
following components:

-   `values:` A numeric vector of singular values.

-   `L:` The specified window length.

-   `N:` The length of the functional time series.

-   `Y:` The original `funts` object.

The generic `plot(`$\cdot$`)` is developed for the `fssa` class to help
the user make decisions on how to do the grouping stage of FSSA/MFSSA.
This method, provides a complete set of visualization tools for the user
to check the quality of the decomposition stage. These SSA-type plots
encompass various types, each providing unique insights into the data:

-   **`"values"`**: Plots the singular values (default).

-   **`"paired"`**: Visualizes pairs of right singular vectors, which is
    particularly useful for detecting periodic components.

-   **`"wcor"`**: Generates a plot of the W-correlation matrix for the
    reconstructed objects.

-   **`"vectors"`**: Displays the right singular vectors, aiding in the
    detection of period length.

-   **`"lcurves"`**: Showcases the left singular functions, assisting in
    period length detection.

-   **`"lheats"`**: Heatmap plots of left singular functions are
    available, designed for `funts` variables observed over one or
    two-dimensional domains. These plots are valuable for identifying
    meaningful patterns.

-   **`"periodogram"`**: Periodogram plots of the right singular vectors
    can be generated, which help detect the frequencies of oscillations
    in functional data.

While efforts have been made to align these plots in
[**Rfsaa**](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=Rfsaa) with the
non-functional versions available in the
[**Rsaa**](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=Rsaa) package, there are
some fundamental differences. Notably, `"lheats"` and `"lcurves"` are
novel plot types introduced in the
[**Rfssa**](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=Rfssa) package for
functional data. Additionally, `"paired"` and `"vectors"` types are
developed based on the right singular vectors. All these plot types
utilize the [**lattice**](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=lattice)
graphics engine. The following example codes generate these plots for
the `Callcenter` dataset.

#### Example: performing decomposition stage of FSSA

In the rest of the paper, we will use the pre-generated `funts` class
object datasets such as `Callcenter` which are included within the
package. These ready-to-use datasets serve as practical examples and
templates, allowing users to test the FSSA procedure without the need to
start from scratch with data preprocessing. As mentioned previously, our
approach involves performing FSSA with a lag window of $L=28$. We then
generate a variety of SSA-type plots, as illustrated in Figure
\@ref(fig:figcall-decomp), using the following code:

``` r
# Load the Callcenter dataset
data("Callcenter")

# Perform FSSA:
fssa_results <- fssa(Callcenter, L = 28)

# FSSA plots:
plot(fssa_results, d = 9, type = "lcurves", 
	main = "(A) Left Singular Functions (within days)")
plot(fssa_results, d = 9, type = "lheats",
	main = "(B) Left Singular Functions (between days)")
plot(fssa_results, d = 13, main = "(C) Singular Values")
plot(fssa_results, d = 9, type = "vectors",
	main = "(D) Right Singular Vectors")
plot(fssa_results, d = 10, type = "paired",
	main = "(E) Paired Plots of Right Singular Vectors")
plot(fssa_results, d = 9, type = "wcor",
	main = "(F) W-Correlation Matrix")
```

```{r figcall-decomp, echo=FALSE , fig.cap="(A): Line plot of the left singular functions, used to identify periodic and trend components; (B): Heatmap of the left singular functions; (C): Scree plot of the singular values often used for grouping; (D): Right singular vectors, used to identify periodic and trend components; (E): Paired plots of the right singular vectors, used for grouping and identifying periodicity in the FTS; (F): Weighted correlation (W-correlation) matrix used for grouping.", fig.alt="graphic without alt text", fig.show='hold', fig.align="center", out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics(c("figures/fssa_call_1.png","figures/fssa_call_2.png","figures/fssa_call_3.png","figures/fssa_call_4.png","figures/fssa_call_5.png","figures/fssa_call_6.png"))
```

The W-correlation matrix in Figure \@ref(fig:figcall-decomp)(F) is built
by measuring the correlation between FTS that are reconstructed using
the grouping of indices by setting $m=r$ (see the discussion on grouping
in section 2). We also have that Figure \@ref(fig:figcall-decomp)(E) is
a plot of successive right singular vectors against one another. Using
Figure \@ref(fig:figcall-decomp)(C, E-F) we identify four groups in the
`Callcenter` data such that $I_{1}=\{1\}$, $I_{2} = \{2,3\}$,
$I_{3}=\{4,5\}$, and $I_{4}=\{6,7\}$. Specifically, as discussed in
[@golyandina2001], periodic components in FTS typically exhibit a rank
of 2, consisting of pairs of harmonic elementary components (sine and
cosine functions with the same frequency). To identify these pairs, we
can examine pairwise scatterplots of the right singular vectors, as
illustrated in Figure \@ref(fig:figcall-decomp)(E). In such
scatterplots, components with identical frequencies, amplitudes, and
phases form points that lie along a circular path. Additionally, the
number of vertices in the resulting regular T-vertex polygon corresponds
to the periodicity of the component. In Figure
\@ref(fig:figcall-decomp)(E), subplots 2 vs. 3, 4 vs. 5, and 6 vs. 7
reveal harmonic factors with frequencies of $1/7$, $8/14$, and $4/7$,
respectively. For a more detailed exploration of extracting meaningful
components from the extracted signal, additional references in the SSA
literature, such as [@golyandina2013], can be consulted. In addition,
using Figure \@ref(fig:figcall-decomp)(A-B, D-E), we see clear weekly
periodic patterns captured in the decomposition, for example the seven
distinct curves found in various subplots of Figure
\@ref(fig:figcall-decomp)(A) and the seven corners seen in subplot 2 vs.
3 of Figure \@ref(fig:figcall-decomp)(E). For interested readers we
provide further results for the decomposition stage and the `fssa`
object in the GitHub repository of the
[**Rfssa**](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=Rfssa) package
(<https://github.com/haghbinh/Rfssa>).

## Reconstruction and forecasting

After obtaining an object of class `fssa`, the user may then choose to
perform reconstruction using the `freconstruct(`$\cdot$`)` function or
perform forecasting using `fforecast(`$\cdot$`)`. The reconstruction and
forecasting functions both return a list of `funts` objects with length
$m$ (number of groups). We note that even though it is common to perform
forecasting using a combination of groups that best reconstructs the
original signal, the user may try to forecast using several different
combinations of groups.

### Reconstruction

We start by reconstructing the `Callcenter` data using the grouping
suggested from the FSSA decomposition. The following code implements the
reconstruction methodology and gives the plots of the reconstruction in
Figure \@ref(fig:figrecon-call).

``` r
# Define groups and their labels
groups <- list(1, 2:3, 4:5, 6:7, 1:7)
group_labels <- c("(B) First Group",
	"(C) Second Group",
	"(D) Third Group",
	"(E) Fourth Group",
	"(F) Extracted Signal")

# Perform FSSA‌ reconstruction
reconstructed_data  <- freconstruct(fssa_results, groups)

# Create and visualize plots
for (i in 1:length(groups)) {
  print(plotly_funts(reconstructed_data[[i]], main = group_labels[i], 
  		xticklocs = xtlab, xticklabels = xtloc))
}
```

One may observe the mean behavior (from group $I_1$) in Figure
\@ref(fig:figrecon-call)(C), and the weekly behaviors (from groups
$I_2, I_3$ and $I_4$) in Figure \@ref(fig:figrecon-call)(D-F). Note that
the weekly trajectories are more well-separated in $I_4$ as opposed to
the groups $I_2$ and $I_3$. We consider the last group,
$I_{\mathfrak{s}}=\{1,\cdots,7\}$, as the set of indices corresponding
to the leading eigentriples, that capture more than $98\%$ of the
variation in the signal, to reconstruct the original FTS in Figure
\@ref(fig:figrecon-call)(B).

### The `fforecast` Class

As previously mentioned, in addition to performing reconstruction of the
FTS, the package offers the capability to perform forecasting using an
object of class `fssa`. The constructor for this class, i.e., the
`fforecast(`$\cdot$`)` function, accepts the following arguments:

-   `U`: An object of class `fssa` holding the decomposition.

-   `groups`: A list of numeric vectors where each vector is used for
    reconstruction and forecasting.

-   `len`: An integer representing the desired length of the forecasted
    FTS.

-   `method`: A character string specifying the type of forecasting to
    perform, with options including:

    -   \"recurrent\" for FSSA R-forecasting.

    -   \"vector\" for FSSA V-forecasting.

-   `only.new`: A logical argument, when set to `TRUE`, returns only the
    forecasted FTS, otherwise the entire FTS is returned.

The `fforecast(`$\cdot$`)` function returns an S3 class named
`fforecast`, which has been introduced to encapsulate the output of the
function. This class is designed to provide a more organized and
intuitive structure for handling FTS data. The `fforecast` class
includes the following attributes:

-   `original_funts`: This attribute stores the original FTS object,
    allowing users to maintain a clear reference to the original data.

-   `predicted_time`: Stores the forecast time index.

-   `groups`: Contains a list of numeric vectors, where each vector
    includes indices of elementary components of a group used for
    reconstruction and forecasting.

-   `method`: A character string specifying the type of forecasting
    performed.

To streamline user interactions further, we have developed a
`print(`$\cdot$`)` method for the `fforecast` class, making it more
convenient to view and assess forecasted FTS data. To illustrate these
enhancements, consider the continuous of Callcenter data example in the
following:

``` r
# Perform FSSA R-forecasting
pr_R <- fforecast(U = fssa_results, groups = c(1:3), len = 14, method = "recurrent")
# Perform FSSA V-forecasting
pr_V <- fforecast(U = fssa_results, groups = list(1,1:7), len = 14, method = "vector",
	only.new = FALSE)
	
plot(pr_R, main = 'R-Forecast (only.new = TRUE)')
plot(pr_V, main = 'V-Forecast (only.new = FALSE)')
print(pr_V)

# FSSA Forecast (fforecast) class:
# Groups: List of 2
# : num 1
# : int [1:7] 1 2 3 4 5 6 7
# Prediction method:  vector
# Predicted series length:  14
# Predicted time:  Date[1:14], format: "2000-01-01" "2000-01-02" ...

# ---------The original series-----------
# Functional time series (funts) object:
# Number of variables:  1
# Lenght:  365
# Start:  10592
# End:  10956
# Time:  Date[1:365], format: "1999-01-01" "1999-01-02" "1999-01-03"  ...
```

The resulted figure are shown in the Figure \@ref(fig:figforecast).

```{r figforecast, echo=FALSE , fig.cap="plot($\\cdot$) method of fforecast class.", fig.alt="graphic without alt text", fig.show='hold', fig.align="center", out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics(c("figures/Rfore.png","figures/Vfore.png"))
```

The next example will forecast the `Callcenter` FTS one week into the
future, based on the first $358$ days of the year, by leveraging the
FSSA R-forecasting and V-forecasting methods as the results that had
been given in the Figure \@ref(fig:figfor-call).

``` r
# Define the data length
N <- Callcenter$N
U1 <- fssa(Callcenter[1:(N-7)], 28)

# Perform recurrent forecasting using FSSA
fore_R = fforecast(U1, groups = list(1:7), method = "recurrent", len = 7)[[1]]

# Perform vector forecasting using FSSA	
fore_V = fforecast(U1, groups = list(1:7), method = "vector", len = 7)[[1]]

# Extract the true call data
true_call <- Callcenter[(N-7+1):N]

# Define weekdays and colors
wd <- c('Sunday', 'Monday', 'Tuesday', 'Wednesday','Thursday', 'Friday', 'Saturday')
clrs <- c("black", "turquoise4", "darkorange")
argvals <- seq(0, 23, length.out = 100)
par(mfrow = c(1,7), mar = c(0.2, 0.2, 2, 0.2))

# Iterate over the days of the week
for(i in 1:7) {
	plot(true_call[i], col = clrs[1], ylim = c(0, 5.3),
		lty = 3, yaxt = "n", xaxt = "n", main = wd[i])
	plot(fore_R[i], col = clrs[2], lty = 2, add = TRUE)
	plot(fore_V[i], col = clrs[3], lty = 5, add = TRUE)
}
legend("top", c("Original", "R-forecasting", "V-forecasting"), col = clrs,
	lty = c(3, 2, 5))
```

literature of [@haghbin2021] and [@trinka2023functional].

## A shiny application

The [**Rfssa**](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=Rfssa) package
contains shiny-apps for both FSSA and MFSSA methods. Those shiny-apps
can be called using the `launchApp(`$\cdot$`)` function, and also
available in <http://sctc.mscs.mu.edu/fssa.htm> and
<http://sctc.mscs.mu.edu/mfssa.htm>. Here we present the features of the
MFSSA app, since the FSSA app would be a special case of that. MFSSA
shiny-app was developed to visualize and extract the information related
to MFTS in a non-parametric framework. The proposed shiny-app provides a
friendly GUI for user to implement the
[**Rfssa**](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=Rfssa) functionalities
and even compare the results with the non-functional version
([**Rssa**](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=Rssa)).

Figure \@ref(fig:figshiny) provides a snapshot of the features available
in MFSSA shiny-app. In the top of the side bar panel, user may specify
the basis functions (B-spline or Fourier) and the associated degrees of
freedom to represent the `funts` object. Those basis functions can be
visualized in sub-panel ['Basis Functions']{.sans-serif} under the main
panel. The remaining inputs in the side bar will be used in other
sub-panels. Specifically 'Groups' is an input box for the third step of
the MFSSA algorithm. Each group is specified via a vector (e.g.
'`c(1,2,4)`' or '`1:3`') and separated from other groups with a comma
(','). The slider 'd' is used to specify the dimensions used in MFSSA
(scree, W-correlation, paired, singular vectors & functions, and
periodogram plots). The check-box (a) 'Demean' is used to subtract the
mean to obtain mean-zero functions; (b) 'Dbl Range' is used to extend
the y-axis to cover all potential mirror functions (e.g. sometime FPCs
may get multiply by a negative sign); and (c) 'Univ. FSSA' to compare
the MFSSA results with marginal FSSA ones respectively. The 'Win.L.'
slider specify the window lengths for the MSSA and the MFSSA. The 'run
M(F)SSA' button is used to run MSSA and MFSSA using the specified
parameters for the given dataset. In general, for the side bar, the top
inputs (above the red line) are mostly to describe the basis functions.
The bottom inputs (below the red line) are used to specify SSA and FSSA
parameters.

```{r figshiny, echo=FALSE , fig.cap="Snapshot of the MFSSA shiny-app", fig.alt="graphic without alt text", fig.show='hold', fig.align="center", out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics(c("figures/shiny.png"))
```

The main panel includes five sub-panels. Here we briefly describe the
features in each of these sub-panels:

-   ['Input Data']{.sans-serif}: In this sub-panel user can either (a)
    use the functional datasets available in the
    [**Rfssa**](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=Rfssa) package (e.g,
    `Callcenter` data or remote sensing datasets); (b) simulate MFTS
    [see @haghbin2021 for details on simulation setup]; or (c) upload
    any arbitrary FTS matrix (where FTS are given in common grid-points
    and are represented in the columns of the data matrix) to provide
    the dataset and then analyze it.

-   ['Basis Functions']{.sans-serif}: As described before we illustrate
    the basis functions selected by user in this sub-panel.

-   ['Data Analysis']{.sans-serif}: In this sub-panel user can call
    variety of tools to

    -   visualize the MFTS.

    -   obtain the optimal number of basis functions based on the GCV
        criteria.

    -   select variety of outputs under MSSA and MFSSA, that includes
        scree plot, W-correlation plot, paired plots, singular vectors
        plots, periodogram plots, singular functions (heat or regular
        plots), and reconstruction of FTS using different type of plots
        (heat, regular, 3Dline and 3Dsurface). An example of the 3Dline
        reconstruction plot for the `Callcenter` data is given in Figure
        \@ref(fig:figshiny).

-   ['Forecasting']{.sans-serif}: This sub-panel would be accessible
    after user runs the MFSSA procedure, and it includes the
    functionalities of R-forecasting and V-forecasting algorithms.

-   ['Manual']{.sans-serif}: This sub-panel provides a brief instruction
    manual to use the MFSSA shiny-app.

## Summary and conclusion {#sec:conclusion}

In summary, **Rfssa** is a pioneering package that brings the power of
SSA to the realm of functional time series, offering novel techniques
for decomposition, reconstruction, multivariate analysis, and functional
forecasting. Its flexible data representation and functional context for
SSA make it a valuable addition to the CRAN ecosystem, providing unique
capabilities not readily available in other packages.

Notably, the package offers extensive capabilities for analyzing
FTS/MFTS data, allowing joint analysis of smoothed curves and image data
across different dimensional domains. The implementations of the
methodologies in the package have been optimized for speed by leveraging
the functionalities of
[**RcppEigen**](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=RcppEigen) and
[**RSpectra**](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=RSpectra) R packages,
along with custom [C++]{.sans-serif} code. By utilizing the
[**Rfssa**](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=Rfssa) package,
researchers and practitioners can easily apply advanced FSSA-based
techniques to their data, yielding informative results that can
significantly enhance decision-making across various applied domains.
The intuitive nature and computational efficiency of the package make it
a valuable asset for the FTS analysis toolkit.
