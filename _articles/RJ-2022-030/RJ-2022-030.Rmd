title: 'TensorTest2D: Fitting Generalized Linear Models with Matrix Covariates'
abstract: ' The [TensorTest2D](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=TensorTest2D) package
  provides the means to fit generalized linear models on second-order tensor type
  data. Functions within this package can be used for parameter estimation (e.g.,
  estimating regression coefficients and their standard deviations) and hypothesis
  testing. We use two examples to illustrate the utility of our package in analyzing
  data from different disciplines. In the first example, a tensor regression model
  is used to study the effect of multi-omics predictors on a continuous outcome variable
  which is associated with drug sensitivity. In the second example, we draw a subset
  of the MNIST handwritten images and fit to them a logistic tensor regression model.
  A significance test characterizes the image pattern that tells the difference between
  two handwritten digits. We also provide a function to visualize the areas as effective
  classifiers based on a tensor regression model. The visualization tool can also
  be used together with other variable selection techniques, such as the LASSO, to
  inform the selection results. '
