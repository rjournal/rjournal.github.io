title: Nonparametric Independence Tests and k-sample Tests for Large Sample Sizes
  Using Package HHG
abstract: Nonparametric tests of independence and k-sample tests are ubiquitous in
  modern applica tions, but they are typically computationally expensive. We present
  a family of nonparametric tests that are computationally efficient and powerful
  for detecting any type of dependence between a pair of univariate random variables.
  The computational complexity of the suggested tests is sub-quadratic in sample size,
  allowing calculation of test statistics for millions of observations. We survey
  both algorithms and the HHG package in which they are implemented, with usage examples
  showing the implementation of the proposed tests for both the independence case
  and the k-sample problem. The tests are compared to existing nonparametric tests
  via several simulation studies comparing both runtime and power. Special focus is
  given to the design of data structures used in implementation of the tests. These
  data structures can be useful for developers of nonparametric distribution-free
  tests.
