title: Navigating the R Package Universe
abstract: Today, the enormous number of contributed packages available to R users
  outstrips any given user’s ability to understand how these packages work, their
  relative merits, or how they are related to each other. We organized a plenary session
  at useR!2017 in Brussels for the R community to think through these issues and ways
  forward. This session considered three key points of discussion. Users can navigate
  the universe of R packages with (1) capabilities for directly searching for R packages,
  (2) guidance for which packages to use, e.g., from CRAN Task Views and other sources,
  and (3) access to common interfaces for alternative approaches to essentially the
  same problem.
