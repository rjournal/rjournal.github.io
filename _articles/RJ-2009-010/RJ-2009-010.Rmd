title: 'PMML: An Open Standard for Sharing Models'
abstract: The PMML package exports a variety of predictive and descriptive models
  from R to the Predictive Model Markup Language (Data Mining Group, 2008). PMML is
  an XML-based language and has become the de-facto standard to represent not only
  predictive and descriptive models, but also data preand post-processing. In so doing,
  it allows for the interchange of models among different tools and environments,
  mostly avoiding proprietary issues and incompatibilities.
