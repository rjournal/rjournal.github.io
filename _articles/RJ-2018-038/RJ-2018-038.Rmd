title: 'mmpf: Monte-Carlo Methods for Prediction Functions'
abstract: 'Machine learning methods can often learn high-dimensional functions which
  generalize well but are not human interpretable. The mmpf package marginalizes prediction
  functions using Monte-Carlo methods, allowing users to investigate the behavior
  of these learned functions, as on a lower dimensional subset of input features:
  partial dependence and variations thereof. This makes machine learning methods more
  useful in situations where accurate prediction is not the only goal, such as in
  the social sciences where linear models are commonly used because of their interpretability.
  Many methods for estimating prediction functions produce estimated functions which
  are not directly human-interpretable because of their complexity: for example, they
  may include high dimensional interactions and/or complex nonlinearities. While a
  learning method’s capacity to automatically learn interactions and nonlinearities
  is attractive when the goal is prediction, there are many cases where users want
  good predictions and the ability to understand how predictions depend on the features.
  mmpf implements general methods for interpreting prediction functions using Monte-Carlo
  methods. These methods allow any function which generates predictions to be be interpreted.
  mmpf is currently used in other packages for machine learning like edarf and mlr
  (Jones and Linder, 2016; Bischl et al., 2016).'
