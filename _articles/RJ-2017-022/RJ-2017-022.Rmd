title: 'BayesBinMix: an R Package for Model Based Clustering of Multivariate Binary
  Data'
abstract: The BayesBinMix package offers a Bayesian framework for clustering binary
  data with or without missing values by fitting mixtures of multivariate Bernoulli
  distributions with an unknown number of components. It allows the joint estimation
  of the number of clusters and model parameters using Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling.
  Heated chains are run in parallel and accelerate the convergence to the target posterior
  distribution. Identifiability issues are addressed by implementing label switching
  algorithms. The package is demonstrated and benchmarked against the Expectation
  Maximization algorithm using a simulation study as well as a real dataset.
