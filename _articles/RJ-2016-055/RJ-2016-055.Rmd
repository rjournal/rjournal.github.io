title: 'micompr: An R Package for Multivariate Independent Comparison of Observations'
abstract: The R package micompr implements a procedure for assessing if two or more
  multivariate samples are drawn from the same distribution. The procedure uses principal
  component analysis to convert multivariate observations into a set of linearly uncorrelated
  statistical measures, which are then compared using a number of statistical methods.
  This technique is independent of the distributional properties of samples and automatically
  selects features that best explain their differences. The procedure is appropriate
  for comparing samples of time series, images, spectrometric measures or similar
  high-dimension multivariate observations.
