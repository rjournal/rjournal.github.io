title: 'HCmodelSets: An R Package for Specifying Sets of Well-fitting Models in High
  Dimensions'
abstract: In the context of regression with a large number of explanatory variables,
  Cox and Battey (2017) emphasize that if there are alternative reasonable explanations
  of the data that are statistically indistinguishable, one should aim to specify
  as many of these explanations as is feasible. The standard practice, by contrast,
  is to report a single effective model for prediction. This paper illustrates the
  R implementation of the new ideas in the package HCmodelSets, using simple reproducible
  examples and real data. Results of some simulation experiments are also reported.
