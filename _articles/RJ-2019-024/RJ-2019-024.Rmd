title: 'shadow: R Package for Geometric Shadow Calculations in an Urban Environment'
abstract: This paper introduces the shadow package for R. The package provides functions
  for shadow related calculations in the urban environment, namely shadow height,
  shadow footprint and Sky View Factor (SVF) calculations, as well as a wrapper function
  to estimate solar radiation while taking shadow effects into account. All functions
  operate on a layer of polygons with a height attribute, also known as “extruded
  polygons” or 2.5D vector data. Such data are associated with accuracy limitations
  in representing urban environments. However, unlike 3D models, polygonal layers
  of building outlines along with their height are abundantly available and their
  processing does not require specialized closed-source 3D software. The present package
  thus brings spatio-temporal shadow, SVF and solar radiation calculation capabilities
  to the open-source spatial analysis workflow in R. Package functionality is demonstrated
  using small reproducible examples for each function. Wider potential use cases include
  urban environment applications such as evaluation of micro-climatic influence for
  urban planning, studying urban climatic comfort and estimating photovoltaic energy
  production potential.
