title: Identifying Complex Causal Dependencies in Configurational Data with Coincidence
  Analysis
abstract: We present cna, a package for performing Coincidence Analysis (CNA). CNA
  is a config urational comparative method for the identification of complex causal
  dependencies—in particular, causal chains and common cause structures—in configurational
  data. After a brief introduction to the method’s theoretical background and main
  algorithmic ideas, we demonstrate the use of the package by means of an artificial
  and a real-life data set. Moreover, we outline planned enhancements of the package
  that will further increase its applicability.
