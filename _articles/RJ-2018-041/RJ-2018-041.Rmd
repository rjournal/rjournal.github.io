title: 'The utiml Package: Multi-label Classification in R'
abstract: Learning classification tasks in which each instance is associated with
  one or more labels are known as multi-label learning. The implementation of multi-label
  algorithms, performed by different researchers, have several specificities, like
  input/output format, different internal functions, distinct programming language,
  to mention just some of them. As a result, current machine learning tools include
  only a small subset of multi-label decomposition strategies. The utiml package is
  a framework for the application of classification algorithms to multi-label data.
  Like the well known MULAN used with Weka, it provides a set of multi-label procedures
  such as sampling methods, transformation strategies, threshold functions, pre-processing
  techniques and evaluation metrics. The package was designed to allow users to easily
  perform complete multi-label classification experiments in the R environment. This
  paper describes the utiml API and illustrates its use in different multi-label classification
  scenarios.
