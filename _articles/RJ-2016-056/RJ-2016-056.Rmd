title: 'mixtox: An R Package for Mixture Toxicity Assessment'
abstract: 'Mixture toxicity assessment is indeed necessary for humans and ecosystems
  that are contin ually exposed to a variety of chemical mixtures. This paper describes
  an R package, called mixtox, which offers a general framework of curve fitting,
  mixture experimental design, and mixture toxicity prediction for practitioners in
  toxicology. The unique features of mixtox include: (1) constructing a uniform table
  for mixture experimental design; and (2) predicting toxicity of a mixture with multiple
  components based on reference models such as concentration addition, independent
  action, and generalized concentration addition. We describe the various functions
  of the package and provide examples to illustrate their use and show the collaboration
  of mixtox with other existing packages (e.g., drc) in predicting toxicity of chemical
  mixtures.'
