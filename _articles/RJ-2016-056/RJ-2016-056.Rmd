# Introduction

Environmental chemicals usually occur as complex mixtures rather than a
single compound. Humans and ecosystems are continually exposed to a
variety of chemical mixtures with changing composition under different
circumstances. Public concern over environmental chemicals demands
extensive risk assessment of various mixtures. Today, risk assessment of
the effect of environmental mixtures is mainly based on a complex
framework in the context of reference models [@Backhaus:2012].
Predicting toxicity of mixtures using reference models is usually based
on the fitting information of individual concentration response curves
[@Faust:2003; @Faust:2001]. Knowledge on the synergistic, antagonistic
and additive effects of multiple stressors will be helpful for
regulatory agencies in the risk assessment of environmental chemicals.

Curve fitting of individual concentration responses is the basis for
predicting the effect of mixtures. Many sigmoidal regression functions
have been proposed for the fitting of monotonic nonlinear concentration
response data [@Goutelle:2008; @Scholze:2001; @Spiess:2010]. Sigmoidal
functions (e.g., Logit and Weibull) with a lower limit of 0 and an upper
limit of 1 [@Scholze:2001] are suitable for quantal response data. Other
functions like three- or four-parameter Hill functions [@Goutelle:2008]
and three- or four-parameter Weibull and Logistic functions
[@Spiess:2010] could be used for both quantal and continuous response
data. Both proprietary (e.g., Origin) and free-to-download software
(e.g., EPA Probit analysis program and BMDS; <https://www.epa.gov/bmds>)
are available for curve fitting. Focusing on R packages we must mention
[*drc*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=drc) [@Ritz:2005],
[*drfit*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=drfit) [@Ranke:2015], and
[*ezec*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=ezec) [@Kamvar:2015].
Package *drc* provides a suite of flexible and versatile model fitting
and after-fitting functions to analyze concentration response data.

Appropriate mixture experiments need to be designed to analyze
interactions (synergistic, antagonistic, or additive) between/among
mixture components. Usually, fixed-ratio ray design is employed to
systematically measure the effect of mixtures. One popular fixed-ratio
ray design is the equal effect concentration ratio (EECR)
[@Faust:2003; @Faust:2001], which designs mixtures according to the
proportion of a particular effect concentration, say half maximal effect
concentration (EC50), of individual chemicals. EECR has become a de
facto standard for the experimental investigation of chemical
interaction for all kind of mixtures. The call for simulating
"environmentally realistic" mixtures [@Backhaus:2012] requires more
sophisticated experimental design for mixtures. The uniform design
concentration ratio (UDCR, or uniform design ray; @Liu:2015) was
proposed to construct the "environmentally realistic" mixtures.
Constructing appropriate uniform design tables [@Ning:2011] is the key
to the sophisticated uniform experimental design. Uniform design tables
with various number of runs, factors, and levels calculated by Professor
Fang and his colleagues can be found on the website
<http://sites.stat.psu.edu/~rli/DMCE/UniformDesign/>. However, those
tables are not specifically tuned for mixture experimental design. The
APTox program [@Liu:2012], assessment and prediction on toxicity of
chemical mixtures, developed based on Visual Basic, provides a module to
construct uniform design tables. To the best of our information, there
is no R package available for the construction of uniform design table.

Concentration addition (CA) and independent action (IA) are two
classical reference concepts that allow predicting toxicity of mixture
substances [@Backhaus:2012]. CA assumes to predict toxicity of mixture
compounds with a similar mechanism of action. In contrast to CA, IA
assumes mixture components act on different biological targets of an
exposed organism independently. The expected effect of mixtures can
hence be calculated according to the joint probability of statistically
independent events. The package *drc* [@Ritz:2005; @Ritz:2014] provides
fitting models (e.g., CA, Hewlett, and Voelund) incorporating
synergism/antagonism for binary and ternary mixtures. However, there is
a need for evaluating the effect of mixtures with more than three
components. The CA and IA models are suitable for fitting mixtures with
quantal concentration response data (or quantal responses after proper
transformation). Generalized concentration addition (GCA) [@Howard:2009]
was proposed to examine mixtures containing partial agonists. GCA is
appropriate for both quantal and continuous concentration response
relationships. A following study [@Hadrup:2013] showed GCA could predict
a larger range of the concentration response curve as compared with the
CA and IA models. GCA is appropriate for both quantal and continuous
concentration response relationships.

The goal of this paper is to describe an R package, called
[*mixtox*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=mixtox) [@Zhu2016], that
allows to perform curve fitting, experimental design, and mixture
toxicity assessment. In this paper, we will introduce curve fitting of
individual concentration response data using a series of sigmoidal
models, mixture experimental design based on different strategies, and
mixture toxicity prediction based on CA, IA, and GCA, as well as
follow-up analysis.

The paper is organized as follows. First, the statistical fundamentals
underneath the curve fitting, experimental design, and mixture toxicity
prediction are briefly recalled. Then the main functions in *mixtox* are
listed and their use described. Finally, several examples are provided
to illustrate the use of these functions.

# Outline of statistical fundamentals

Consider a set of $n$ concentration response data points $(x_1,\ y_1)$,
$(x_2,\ y_2)$, $\cdots$ $(x_n,\ y_n)$ and model function
$y=f(x,\boldsymbol{\theta})+\bf e$ with $p$ parameters
$\boldsymbol{\theta} =(\theta_1,\ \theta_2,\ \cdots,\ \theta_p)$. A
non-linear least square regression was used to fit the concentration
response data. The purpose of non-linear least square regression is to
find the parameter **$\theta$** to minimize the sum of squares of
$\bf e$ (a vector of errors). With the help of the modified
Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm, package
[*minpack.lm*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=minpack.lm)
[@Elzhov:2015] is more efficient than the built-in `nls` function in
solving nonlinear least-squares problems. It was employed to fit the
concentration response data instead of `nls`.

## Goodness of fit statistics

The *mixtox* package provides 13 sigmoidal functions to fit
concentration response data. A series of goodness of fit statistics were
provided to select the best fit. These statistics include coefficient of
determination $(R^2)$, the bias-corrected coefficient of determination
$(R_{adj}^2)$, root mean squared error $(RMSE)$, mean absolute error
$(MAE)$, Akaike information criterion $(AIC)$, the bias-corrected
$AICc$, and Bayesian information criterion $(BIC)$. The mathematical
expression of these statistics can be found in @Liao:2003 and
@Spiess:2010. A variety of functions can be used to fit the
concentration responses of one compound on an organism. Previously, the
best model was selected based on the highest $R^2$ and $R_{adj}^2$,
lowest $RMSE$, and lowest $MAE$. However, $R^2$ or even $R_{adj}^2$ are
not sensitive measures for nonlinear models as compared with $AIC$,
$AICc$, and $BIC$ [@Spiess:2010]. Here, we suggest that users select the
best model based on the lowest $AIC$, $AICc$, and $BIC$.

## Confidence intervals

The Delta method [@Dybowski:2001] is used to construct confidence
intervals for predicted responses. The (non-simultaneous) confidence
interval ($CI$) at the predictor value $x$ is given as follows:
$$\begin{aligned}
\label{eq:1-zhu}
  CI= f(\hat{\boldsymbol{\theta}})\pm t_{(n-p,\,(1-\alpha)/2)}\sqrt{\Big(\nu^T Var(\hat{\boldsymbol{\theta}})\nu\Big)},
\end{aligned}   (\#eq:1-zhu)$$
where $t$ is the inverse of Student's $t$ cumulative distribution
function, $\alpha$ is the confidence level (usually 95%); the
superscript $T$ denotes transpose; $\boldsymbol{\nu}$ is the row vector
of the Jacobian evaluated at a specified predictor value.

$Var(\hat{\boldsymbol{\theta}})$ in \@ref(eq:1-zhu) is the covariance
matrix of the parameter estimates.
$$\begin{aligned}
  Var(\hat{\boldsymbol{\theta}})= \sigma^2 \Big(J(\boldsymbol{\theta})^T J(\boldsymbol{\theta})\Big)^{-1},
\end{aligned}$$
where $\sigma^2$ is the squared residual standard error.
$J(\boldsymbol{\theta})$ is the Jacobian matrix of
$f(\boldsymbol{\theta})$ with respect to the coefficients.

The (non-simultaneous) prediction bounds for a new observation
[@Huet:2004] (i.e., prediction interval, $PI$) were found to show better
characterization on responses at the extremely low concentrations
[@Zhu:2013]. The $PI$ [@DeGryze:2007; @Huet:2004] was recommended as the
primary choice for uncertainty characterization:
$$\begin{aligned}
  PI= f(\hat{\boldsymbol{\theta}})\pm t_{(n-m,\,(1-\alpha)/2)}\sqrt{\sigma^2 +\Big(\nu^T Var(\hat{\boldsymbol{\theta}})\nu\Big)}.
\end{aligned}$$

The $PI$ for new observations should be wider than the $CI$ for the
additional variance ($\sigma^2$) in predicting new responses (the fit
plus random errors).

## Uniform design table

Many experimental design methods such as generalized Latin hypercube
design [@Dette:2010] and uniform design [@Ning:2011] can be used to
construct chemical mixtures. The uniform design was incorporated into
package *mixtox*. Uniform design is an efficient experimental design
method to simulate environmentally realistic mixtures. It allows
researchers to investigate mixtures with more chemicals (i.e., factors
in uniform design) and concentrations (levels) while simultaneously
minimizing the number of experiments [@Liu:2015].

As a prerequisite for constructing a uniform design table, researchers
need to plan the number of runs, factors, and levels for a mixture
experiment according to their experiment. Usually, the number of runs is
an integer multiple of levels. Assume that we want to test the mixture
effect of three compounds each with four different concentrations. Based
on the three factors (compounds) and four levels (concentrations), a
uniform design table with four runs would be suitable for this case. If
we want to use a uniform design table with eight runs, then the levels
(concentrations) need to be allocated in repetition to form
pseudo-levels [@Liang:2001], the number of which equals that of runs.

The good lattice point method [@Zhou:2013] with a power generator was
used to construct a uniform table based on the number of runs. The
centered $L_2$-discrepancy ($CD_2$) [@Hickernell:1996; @Zhou:2013] was
employed to measure the uniformity and find the one with lowest
discrepancy.
$$\begin{aligned}
      CD_2 (P)=\Big[\Big(\frac{13}{12}\Big)^s -\frac{2^{1-s}}{n}\sum_{k=1}^{n}\prod_{i=1}^{s}\theta_{ki}+\frac{1}{n^2}\sum_{k,\,l=1}^{n}\prod_{i=1}^{s}\phi_{k,\,li} \Big]^{1/2},
\end{aligned}$$

with the definition of $\theta_{ki}$ and $\phi_{k,\,li}$ as follows:

$$\begin{aligned}
      \theta_{ki}&=2+\big|x_{ki}-\frac{1}{2}\big|-\big|x_{ki}-\frac{1}{2}\big|^2,\\
      \phi_{k,\,li}&=1+\frac{1}{2}\Big(\big|x_{ki}-\frac{1}{2}\big|+\big|x_{li}-\frac{1}{2}\big|-|x_{ki}-x_{li}|\Big),
\end{aligned}$$

and where $n$ and $s$ are the number of runs (levels or pseudo-levels)
and the number of factors, respectively.

## Reference models

For a well-defined mixture of $n$ components, concentration addition is
expressed mathematically as [@Faust:2001]:
$$\begin{aligned}
\label{eq:7-zhu}
  \sum_{i=1}^{n} \frac{c_i}{ECx_i}=1,
\end{aligned}   (\#eq:7-zhu)$$
where $ECx_i$ is the effect concentration of the $i^{th}$ component that
causes an $x\%$ effect when applied individually at $c_i$. The $c_i$ is
expressed as:
$$\begin{aligned}
\label{eq:8-zhu}
  c_i =p_i \cdot c_{mix}=p_i \cdot EC_{x,\,mix},
\end{aligned}   (\#eq:8-zhu)$$
where $p_i$ is the proportion of the $i^{th}$ component in a mixture,
$c_{mix}$ the concentration of the mixture and $EC_{x,\, mix}$ the
concentration of the mixture that causes an effect of $x\%$. The formula
to predict the effect of a mixture can be expressed as:
$$\begin{aligned}
  EC_{x,\,mix}=\Big(\sum_{i=1}^{n}\frac{p_i}{EC_{x,\,i}}\Big)^{-1}.
\end{aligned}$$
The theoretical basis for independent action is defined as
[@Faust:2001]:
$$\begin{aligned}
\label{eq:2-zhu}
  E(c_{mix})=1-\big(1-E(c_1)\big)\big(1-E(c_2)\big)\cdots \big(1-E(c_n)\big)=1-\prod_{i=1}^{n}\big(1-E(c_i)\big),
\end{aligned}   (\#eq:2-zhu)$$
where $E(c_{mix})$ is the total effect caused by a mixture at the
concentration of $c_{mix}$, and $E(c_i)$ is the effect caused at $c_i$
of individual chemicals. For a fitted function $(f_i)$ based on the
concentration response data of the $i^{th}$ component, $E(c_i)$ is equal
to $f_i(c_i)$. When $E(c_{mix}) = x$, \@ref(eq:2-zhu) can be expressed
as:
$$\begin{aligned}
\label{eq:3-zhu}
  x\%=1-\prod_{i=1}^{n}\Big(1-f_i \Big(p_i\big(EC_{x,\,mix}\big)\Big)\Big).
\end{aligned}   (\#eq:3-zhu)$$
\@ref(eq:3-zhu) can be used to predict the mixture effect for IA.

Generalized concentration addition (GCA) is a natural extension of CA
that could be applied to mixtures including full agonists and partial
agonists or mixtures including full agonists and competitive antagonists
[@Howard:2009]. The general form of GCA is expressed as follows:
$$\begin{aligned}
\label{eq:6-zhu}
  \sum_{i=1}^{n}\frac{c_i}{f_{i}^{-1}(E)}=1.
\end{aligned}   (\#eq:6-zhu)$$

Empirical data were used to fit function $f_i (c_i)$, and then predict
the mixture response using the inverse function $f_i
^{-1}(E)$. Previous studies used the Hill function with Hill coefficient
equal to 1 to fit individual concentration response curves
[@Howard:2010]. It is suitable to fit response data with lower limit
fixed at 0 and no fixed maximal effect.
$$\begin{aligned}
\label{eq:4-zhu}
  f(c)=\frac{\alpha c}{K+c},
\end{aligned}   (\#eq:4-zhu)$$
where $c$ is the concentration, $K$ is the concentration causes $50\%$
effect, and $\alpha$ is the maximal effect level of a chemical on a test
organism. In *mixtox*, function \@ref(eq:4-zhu) was labeled as Hill_two.
The equation to predict the effect of a multiple-component mixture based
on Hill_two is expressed as follows [@Howard:2009]:
$$\begin{aligned}
\label{eq:5-zhu}
  E_{mix}^{GCA}=\Big(\sum_{i=1}^{n}\frac{\alpha_i c_i}{K_i}\Big)\Big/ \Big(1+\sum_{i=1}^{n}\frac{c_i}{K_i}\Big).
\end{aligned}   (\#eq:5-zhu)$$

# Overview of the package

This section provides a description of functions in the R package
*mixtox*. We first detail the main functions that allow to fit
concentration response data. Second, we describe a function to construct
uniform design tables. Then we discuss functions for mixture toxicity
prediction.

## Concentration-response curve fitting

Package *mixtox* provides 13 sigmoidal functions to fit monotonic
concentration responses. First, the name of 13 sigmoidal functions will
display through the command `showEq("sigmoid")`:

``` r
 [1] "Hill"                  "Hill_two"              "Hill_three"           
 [4] "Hill_four"             "Weibull"               "Weibull_three"        
 [7] "Weibull_four"          "Logit"                 "Logit_three"          
[10] "Logit_four"            "BCW(Box-Cox-Weibull)"  "BCL(Box-Cox-Logit)"   
[13] "GL(Generalized Logit)"
```

Then the formula of those functions can be displayed through querying
the function name using `showEq` (e.g., `showEq("Hill")`). Six functions
(i.e., Hill, Weibull, Logit, BCW, BCL, and GL) are suitable to fit
quantal responses in the range of $[0,\, 1]$. The other 7 functions are
suitable to fit continuous concentration responses with response range
out of $[0,\, 1]$.

The main function for curve fitting in *mixtox* is `curveFit`. This
function provides various options. It requires concentration (`x`),
experimental responses (`expr`), a suitable equation (`eq`), and
corresponding starting values (`param`).

``` r
R> curveFit <- function(x, expr, eq , param, effv, sigLev = 0.05)
```

The `eq` term can be any of the 13 sigmoidal equations. The default
significant level (`sigLev`) is 0.05 to calculate the $PI$ and $CI$.
Dunnett test [@Dunnett:1964] was used to calculate the non-observed
effect concentration (NOEC) and lowest observed effect concentration
(LOEC) for quantal concentration response data or response data with
lower limit fixed at 0. The response values for the control in those
data were set to 0 in the calculation of NOEC and LOEC.

``` r
R> NOEC <- function(x, expr, sigLev = 0.05)
```

The starting values (`param`) are indispensable for `curveFit`. The
function `tuneFit` could help users to find proper starting values.
Users need to provide their experimental concentration (`conc`),
corresponding responses (`rspn`) and the equation (`eq`) they choose to
fit the data (e.g., Weibull). Other terms (`effv`, `rsq`, `highBar`,
`bar`, and `sav`) are optional and the detailed explanation can be found
in the reference manual.

``` r
R> tuneFit <- function(conc, rspn, eq = "Weibull", effv, rsq = 0.6, highBar = 5000, 
+    bar = 1000, sav = FALSE)
```

`tuneFit` is essentially a sophisticated wrapper for `nlsLM` in the
package *minpack.lm*. Like the function `drm` in package *drc*
[@Ritz:2005] which provides self starting values, `tuneFit` also
provides starting values for all of the 13 sigmoidal functions. Those
starting values were collected through the fitting of various
concentration response data from various sources (e.g., our lab tests,
published literature, and large databases such as ToxCast;
@Kavlock:2012). The starting values for all of the 13 functions are
stored in `staval` (e.g., `staval$Logit` would show all of the 1786
starting values for the Logit function). `tuneFit` provides a high
frequency trial and error approach to deploy those starting values one
by one until getting the best fit. This approach is quite efficient
especially for the quantal concentration response data.

## Construction of a uniform design table

The function `unidTab` can be called to generate uniform design tables.

``` r
R> unidTab <- function(lev, fac, algo = "cd2")
```

To call `unidTab`, users need to provide the number of runs (levels,
`lev`) and factors (`fac`). Normally, the number of runs equals the
number of levels. If users need to do more runs than levels (the number
of runs is $n$ times that of levels, $n=1,\ 2,\ \cdots$), a pseudo-level
design needs to be performed. Usually, `unidTab` is incorporated into
functions (e.g., `caPred` and `iaPred`) to predict toxicity of mixtures.
Once users provide the levels (pseudo-levels) and fitting information of
individual compounds, the `unidTab` will be called by `caPred` and
`iaPred` to generate uniform table(s) with the lowest discrepancy.

## Mixture toxicity prediction

The function `caPred` can be called to predict the effect of mixtures
based on concentration addition.

``` r
R> caPred <- function(model, param, mixType = c("acr", "eecr", "udcr"), effv, 
+    effPoints)
```

Mixture toxicity prediction is based on the fitting information of
individual concentration response curves. Users need to fit the
individual concentration response data first and provide the fitting
information (`model` used to fit individual concentration responses and
corresponding fitted parameters `param`) to `caPred`. Function `caPred`
provides three optional fix-ratio ray design methods: (1) arbitrary
concentration ratio (`acr`), users can arbitrarily define the proportion
of a component in a mixture. It also allows users to design mixtures
according to certain experimental design methods (e.g., Latin hypercube
design; @Dette:2010); (2) equal effect concentration ratio (`eecr`); and
(3) uniform design concentration ratio (`udcr`). If the mixture type is
`acr`, the term `effv` is a vector of ratios or concentrations that will
eventually be converted into the proportion of mixture components. If
the mixture type is `eecr` or `udcr`, the argument `effv` is a numeric
vector with single or multiple effect values. The argument `effPoints`
is a vector of effect values (with a range of $[0, 1]$).

The function `iaPred` can be called to predict the effect of mixtures
based on IA.

``` r
R> iaPred <- function(model, param, mixType = c("acr", "eecr", "udcr"), effv, 
+    effPoints, lb = 1e-9, ub = 6)
```

Most of the arguments in `iaPred` are the same as those in `caPred`. The
arguments of `lb` and `ub` are the lower and upper bounds of the
concentration range where to find a solution for the constructed IA
equation based on \@ref(eq:3-zhu), respectively. Users can change these
values based on their practical experimental system.

The function `caPred` can only predict mixture effects of chemicals with
quantal concentration responses. That is, `caPred` only covers
concentration response curves fitted by six functions (i.e., Hill,
Weibull, Logit, BCW, BCL, and GL).

The function `gcaHill` can be used to predict the effect of mixtures
based on \@ref(eq:5-zhu) on the condition that all individual
concentration responses should be fitted by the function Hill_two.

``` r
R> gcaHill <- function(model, param, mixType = c("acr", "eecr", "udcr"), effv, 
+    refEffv = c(0.10, 0.50))
```

The reference effects (`refEffv`) need to be provided by users to define
the range of responses. To extend the GCA to be more general, 12 more
functions (Hill, Hill_three, Hill_four, Weibull, Weibull_three,
Weibull_four, Logit, Logit_three, Logit_four, BCW, BCL, and GL) were
incorporated to `gcaPred` according to the general form of GCA equation
in \@ref(eq:6-zhu).

``` r
R> gcaPred <- function(model, param, mixType = c("acr", "eecr", "udcr"), effv,
+    refEffv = c(0.05, 0.50, 0.90), lb = 1E-8, ub =  0.90)
```

# Illustrations

In this section, we illustrate several examples of the use of the
functions described above. Example 1 deals with curve fitting. Example 2
deals with experimental design and mixture toxicity prediction based on
CA, IA, and GCA. Example 3 deals with the connection of mixture toxicity
prediction in *mixtox* with curve fitting in *drc*. Example 4 deals with
follow-up analysis on mixture prediction. The *mixtox* package provides
sigmoidal concentration response data (`antibiotox`) to demonstrate the
usage of different functions.

The `antibiotox` dataset includes the long term toxicity of seven
aminoglycosides (paromomycin sulfate (PAR), spectinomycin
dihydrochloridehydrate (SPE), kanamycin sulfate (KAN), streptomycin
sulfate (STR), dihydrostreptomycin sesquisulfate hydrate (DIH),
gentamycin sulfate (GEN), and Neomycin sulfate (NEO)) and their 12
mixtures designed using different methods on fresh water photobacteria
*Vibro-qinghaiensis* sp. Q67. The concentration unit of these
antibiotics is mole per liter (mol/L). The bioluminesence of
photobacteria was transformed into quantal form with response approaches
0 if chemical's concentration was extremely low and 100% inhibition if
chemical's concentration was infinitely high. Detailed information on
these data and test systems can be found in the reference manual.

## Example 1: Curve fitting

Mixture toxicity prediction is based on the curve fitting information of
individual compounds. For example, we need to use the Logit function to
fit the concentration response data of PAR on photobacteria. To get
proper starting values of $\alpha$ (location parameter) and $\beta$
(slope parameter) for Logit, users need to use the function `tuneFit`.

``` r
R> x <- antibiotox$PAR$x
R> expr <- antibiotox$PAR$y
R> y <- rowMeans(expr)
R> tuneFit(x, y, eq = "Logit")
```

The function `tuneFit` will return a list as follows:

``` r
$sta
      Alpha Beta    r2 adjr2    MAE  RMSE   AIC  AICc   BIC     ecx
fit_1  26.3 4.66 0.995 0.994 0.0234 0.029 -49.1 -47.8 -48.2 1000001
```

The number 1000001 means the effect concentration (ecx) was not
calculated because no `effv` was provided to `tuneFit`. To compare the
result with Weibull:

``` r
R> tuneFit(x, y, eq = "Weibull")

$sta
      Alpha Beta    r2 adjr2    MAE   RMSE AIC  AICc BIC     ecx
fit_1  18.3 3.32 0.993 0.992 0.0223 0.0331 -46 -44.6 -45 1000001
```

These two functions could well describe the concentration response data
of PAR on photobacteria ($r^2 > 0.99$). It is difficult to distinguish
which fit is better purely based on $r^2$. Users need to choose the
better fit (i.e., Logit) based on AIC or BIC (the lower, the better).

Function `tuneFit` also provides an important feature of fitting a batch
of concentration response data of different chemicals. Here, we would
like to example curve fitting of two compounds in a single run.

``` r
R> omim.x <- cytotox$Omim$x
R> omim.y <- rowMeans(cytotox$Omim$y)
R> emim.x <- cytotox$Emim$x
R> emim.y <- rowMeans(cytotox$Emim$y)
R> x <- rbind(omim.x, emim.x)
R> y <- rbind(omim.y, emim.y)

```

In this case, $r^2$ is still useful to give an illustrative evaluation
of the goodness of fit. In cases of various curves fitted by different
functions, there is no way to compare their goodness of fit just based
on AIC or BIC. Thus, we provide as many statistics as possible to allow
users to choose the best fit in the context of their experimental
systems.

Function `curveFit` could be used to fit the concentration response data
of PAR using the starting values of 26.31 and 4.66 for Logit.

``` r
R> fit <- curveFit(x, expr, eq = "Logit", param = c(26.31, 4.66), effv = c(0.05, 0.5))
```

The plot of the fitted concentration response curve
(Figure [1](#figure:1)A) can be shown through function `figPlot`. The
residuals of curve fitting can be found in `fit$res`. The normal Q-Q
plot of residuals was plotted in Figure [1](#figure:1)B using function
`qq4res` in *mixtox*. The R code for Figure [1](#figure:1) is as
follows:

``` r
R> par(mfrow = c(1, 2))
R> x <- antibiotox$PAR$x
R> expr <- antibiotox$PAR$y
R> fit <- curveFit(x, expr, eq = "Logit", param = c(26.31, 4.66), effv = c(0.05, 0.5))
R> figPlot(fit$crcInfo)
R> legend("topleft", legend = "A", border = "white", cex = 1.4)
R> qq4res(fit$res)
R> legend("topleft", legend = "B", border = "white", cex = 1.4)
```

![Figure 1: The fitting information of antibiotic PAR on photobacteria:
(A) concentration response curves. Dot: observed; Black line: fitted
CRC; Red dotted lines: 95% $CI$; Blue dotted lines: 95% $PI$; and (B)
normal Q-Q plots of residuals.](Figure_1.png){#figure:1 width="100%" alt="graphic without alt text"}

The `effv` values of 0.05 and 0.5 imply that the effect concentrations
that cause 5% and 50% effect (EC5 and EC50) are calculated. $PI$s and
$CI$s were both calculated for comparison. The fitted $\alpha$ and
$\beta$ are 26.31 and 4.66, respectively. The goodness of fit statistics
are 0.995, 0.994, 0.02342, 0.02897, $-49.13$, $-47.80$, and $-48.16$ for
$R^2$, $R_{adj}^2$, $MAE$, $RMSE$, $AIC$, $AICc$ and $BIC$,
respectively. The function `curveFit` will call `ECx` to calculate
effect concentration of `effv`. The EC50 of PAR on the inhibition of
luminescence of phtotobacteria is 2.25E$-06$ mol/L with 95% $CI$ of
\[2.11E$-06$, 2.40E$-06$\] mol/L and 95% $PI$ of \[1.95E$-06$,
2.57E$-06$\] mol/L. The EC5 of PAR on the inhibition of luminescence of
phtotobacteria is 5.24E$-07$ mol/L with 95% $CI$ of \[4.37E$-07$,
6.44E$-07$\] mol/L and 95% $PI$ of \[0, 8.44E$-07$\] mol/L. Similarly,
PAR will cause 50% inhibition with 95% $PI$ of \[42.7%, 57.3%\] and 95%
$CI$ of \[46.5%, 53.5%\] at the concentration of 2.25E$-06$ mol/L. PAR
will cause 5% inhibition with 95% $PI$ of \[0%, 11.7%\] and 95% $CI$ of
\[3.14%, 6.86%\] at the concentration of 5.24E$-07$ mol/L.

The NOEC and LOEC can be calculated using the function `NOEC`:

``` r
R> NOEC(x, expr)
```

The values of NOEC and LOEC are 2.29E$-07$ mol/L and 3.55E$-07$ mol/L
for PAR, respectively.

## Example 2: Mixture toxicity prediction

The function `caPred` can be called to predict the effect of mixtures
based on concentration addition. It provides three optional mixture
design methods as mentioned before (ACR, EECR, and UDCR). The effect of
mixtures of seven aminoglycosides combined on photobacteria according to
the EECR design for 5% and 50% effect levels can be predicted by:

``` r
R> model <- antibiotox$sgl$model
R> param <- antibiotox$sgl$param
R> caPred(model, param, mixType = "eecr", effv = c(0.05, 0.5))
```

Function `caPred` will return a series of effects `e` in a range of
$[0, 1]$, predicted concentrations `ca` that cause effects `e`, and the
proportion of individual components (`pct`) for the EECR mixture. The
proportion of individual components is very useful for users to prepare
mixtures in practical experiments.

Here, we want to design 10 UDCR mixtures based on seven antibiotics and
five concentration levels (effect concentrations at the responses of 5%,
10%, 20%, 30% and 50%, respectively). The function `unidTab` can be
called in `caPred` to generate a uniform design table of
U$_{10} (10^{7})$. The uniform table can also be generated with 10 runs
(pseudo-levels) and 7 factors as follows:

``` r
R> unidTab(10, 7)
```

   10   10   9    8    7    6    5    2
  ---------------------------------------

  : 

The CA prediction of those UDCR mixtures is as follows:

``` r
R> caPred(model, param, mixType = "udcr", effv = rep(c(0.05, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.5), 2))
```

The argument `effv` exemplifies the pseudo-level design of the five
levels. Function `caPred` also returns the uniform table employed to
construct UDCR mixtures.

Similarly, the effect of mixtures based on IA for the EECR and UDCR
design can be predicted as follows:

``` r
R> iaPred(model, param, mixType = "eecr", effv = c(0.05, 0.5))
R> iaPred(model, param, mixType = "udcr", effv = rep(c(0.05, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.5), 2))
```

Both the `caPred` and `iaPred` would return the proportion of individual
compounds in each mixture.

Users need to fit all of the individual concentration response data
using Hill_two \@ref(eq:4-zhu) before using function `gcaHill`. Assume
we have fitted four curves using Hill_two with corresponding fitting
information stored in `model_hill2` and `param_hill2`. The effect of
mixtures predicted based on generalized concentration addition for the
EECR and UDCR design can be calculated as follows:

``` r
R> model_hill2 <- c("Hill_two", "Hill_two", "Hill_two", "Hill_two")
R> param_hill2 <- matrix(c(3.94e-5, 0.97, 5.16e-4, 1.50, 3.43e-6, 1.04, 9.18e-6, 0.77),
+    nrow = 4, ncol = 2, byrow = TRUE)
R> gcaHill(model_hill2, param_hill2, mixType = "eecr", effv = c(0.05, 0.5))
R> effv <- c(0.05, 0.10, 0.15, 0.20, 0.25, 0.30, 0.50)
R> gcaHill(model_hill2, param_hill2, mixType = "udcr", effv)
```

## Example 3: Connection of *mixtox* with *drc* 

Package *drc* is widely used for curve fitting of concentration response
data. Many users are accustomed to its convenience in curve fitting. The
two-parameter log-logistic function ($LL.2$) and two-parameter Weibull
functions ($W1.2$ and $W2.2$) with the lower limit fixed at 0 and the
upper limit fixed at 1 in *drc* are suitable for quantal responses. The
function `drm` is a general model fitting function for analysis of
concentration response data in *drc*.

Here we would like to show an example of connecting the curve fitting
(`drm`) in *drc* with the mixture effects prediction (`caPred` and
`iaPred`) in *mixtox*. Assume we need to predict the effect of mixtures
of four antibiotics (PAR, SPE, KAN, and STR) on photobacteria. First, we
need to fit these concentration response data (stored in `antibiotox`)
using `drm`. The $LL.2$ function is selected to fit these response data.

``` r
R> library(mixtox)
R> library(drc)
R> PAR.x <- antibiotox$PAR$x
R> PAR.y <- rowMeans(antibiotox$PAR$y)
R> PAR <- data.frame(x = PAR.x, y = PAR.y)
R> SPE <- data.frame(x = antibiotox$SPE$x, y = rowMeans(antibiotox$SPE$y))
R> KAN <- data.frame(x = antibiotox$KAN$x, y = rowMeans(antibiotox$KAN$y))
R> STR <- data.frame(x = antibiotox$STR$x, y = rowMeans(antibiotox$STR$y))

R> PAR.fit <- drm(y ~ x, data = PAR, fct = LL.2())
R> SPE.fit <- drm(y ~ x, data = SPE, fct = LL.2())
R> KAN.fit <- drm(y ~ x, data = KAN, fct = LL.2())
R> STR.fit <- drm(y ~ x, data = STR, fct = LL.2())
R> param.LL.2 <- rbind(PAR.fit$fit$par, SPE.fit$fit$par, KAN.fit$fit$par, 
+    STR.fit$fit$par)
R> rownames(param.LL.2) <- c("PAR", "SPE", "KAN", "STR")
R> colnames(param.LL.2) <- c("b", "e")
```

The fitted parameters $b$ and $e$ for $LL.2$ [@Ritz:2005] are stored in
`param.LL.2`. The formula of $LL.2$ in *drc* and Logit in *mixtox* seem
different, but they are essentially the same expression. The following
equations can be used to transform $b$ and $e$ in $LL.2$ into $\alpha$
and $\beta$ in Logit, respectively.
$$\begin{aligned}
  \alpha&= -\log (e) \cdot\beta,&
  \beta&= -b\cdot \ln (10).
\end{aligned}$$

The following code can be used to transform $b$ and $e$ in $LL.2$ into
$\alpha$ and $\beta$ in Logit numerically.

``` r
R> Beta <- -param.LL.2[, 1] * log(10)
R> Alpha <- -log10(param.LL.2[, 2]) * Beta
R> param.Logit <- cbind(Alpha, Beta)
```

The effect of mixtures of four antibiotics on photobacteria according
to, say, the EECR design at 5% and 50% effect levels can be predicted
by:

``` r
R> model.Logit <- c("Logit", "Logit"," Logit", "Logit")
R> caPred(model.Logit, param.Logit, mixType = "eecr", effv = c(0.05, 0.5))
R> iaPred(model.Logit, param.Logit, mixType = "eecr", effv = c(0.05, 0.5))
```

## Example 4: Follow-up analysis

Figure [2](#figure:2) shows the comparison of CA and IA prediction with
experimental observation of EECR mixtures. The code for this comparison
is shown in [Appendix](#sec:appendix).

![Figure 2: Experimental, predicted CA, and IA concentration response
curves of 2 mixtures designed by equal effect concentration ratio (EE05
and EE50). Dot: observed; Black line: fitted CRC; Grey dotted lines: 95%
$PI$; Blue dashed line: IA prediction; Red dashed line: CA. The code is
listed in [Appendix](#sec:appendix).](Figure_2.png){#figure:2 width="100%" alt="graphic without alt text"}

We can conclude that the mixture toxicity of seven antibiotics can be
predicted by the IA model since the IA curve locates in the 95% $PI$ of
the experimental curve.

Despite the CA and IA prediction at particular effect concentrations, it
is also meaningful to know the CA and IA prediction at particular
effects. For example, the luminescence of photobacteria will be
inhibited by 5% at the concentration of 1.41E$-7$ mol/L and 1.77E$-7$
mol/L for EE05 and EE50 mixtures, respectively. The CA and IA prediction
at the concentration of 1.41E$-7$ mol/L (EE05) and 1.77E$-7$ mol/L
(EE50) can be calculated based on \@ref(eq:7-zhu) and \@ref(eq:2-zhu),
respectively. The dichotomy technique was employed to solve the
constructed CA equation based on \@ref(eq:7-zhu). This calculation
requires fitted concentration response information of individual
chemicals, their ratios in the mixtures, and the established
concentration response information of mixtures. Function `eiaPred` and
`ecaPred` can be called as follows:

``` r
R> model <- antibiotox$eecr.mix$model
R> param <- antibiotox$eecr.mix$param
R> pct <- antibiotox$eecr.pct
R> mix <- list(model = model, param = param)
R> eiaPred(effv = 0.05, antibiotox$sgl, mix, pct)
R> ecaPred(effv = 0.05, antibiotox$sgl, mix, pct)
```

The two functions first calculate the effect concentrations based on the
fitted concentration response information of mixtures (i.e., the
selected equations and associated coefficients contained in
`antibiotox$eecr.mix`) according to the input effects `effv` (e.g.,
5.0%). The concentration of an individual component ($c_i$) is computed
from \@ref(eq:8-zhu) based on the mixture's effect concentration and the
ratio of components in the mixture `antibiotox$pct` ($p_i$). The IA
predicted effect for EE5 and EE50 are 1.80% and 3.04%, respectively. The
CA predicted effect of EE5 and EE50 are 2.78% and 4.25%, respectively.

# Conclusions

Package *mixtox* mainly targets toxicologists in the study of chemicals'
toxicity and the effect of mixtures. It offers a general framework of
curve fitting, experimental design, and mixture prediction for
practitioners in toxicology. The unique features of *mixtox* include:
(1) construction of uniform design table; and (2) mixture toxicity
prediction for multiple components based on CA, IA, and GCA. Function
`gcaHill` is capable of examining mixtures containing partial agonists
or even full agonists. However, we are lacking experimental data in
*mixtox* to verify its ability. *mixtox* aims to predict the effect of
mixtures with more than two components. It cannot make isoboles for
binary mixtures. Users may need to draw isoboles using package *drc* or
other software package based on the results calculated with *mixtox*.
The current version of *mixtox* (version number 1.3.1) is available on
CRAN. We received a lot of feedback from users since its release last
year. Now it is still under rapid development to improve its performance
and try to include more features in toxicology.
