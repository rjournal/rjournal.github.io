title: 'wavScalogram: An R Package with Wavelet Scalogram Tools for Time Series Analysis'
abstract: ' In this work we present the wavScalogram R package, which contains methods
  based on wavelet scalograms for time series analysis. These methods are related
  to two main wavelet tools: the windowed scalogram difference and the scale index.
  The windowed scalogram difference compares two time series, identifying if their
  scalograms follow similar patterns at different scales and times, and it is thus
  a useful complement to other comparison tools such as the squared wavelet coherence.
  On the other hand, the scale index provides a numerical estimation of the degree
  of non-periodicity of a time series and it is widely used in many scientific areas. '
