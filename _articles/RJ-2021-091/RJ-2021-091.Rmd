title: 'cat.dt: An R package for fast construction of accurate Computerized Adaptive
  Tests using Decision Trees'
abstract: This article introduces the cat.dt package for the creation of Computerized
  Adaptive Tests (CATs). Unlike existing packages, the cat.dt package represents the
  CAT in a Decision Tree (DT) structure. This allows building the test before its
  administration, ensuring that the creation time of the test is independent of the
  number of participants. Moreover, to accelerate the construction of the tree, the
  package controls its growth by joining nodes with similar estimations or distributions
  of the ability level and uses techniques such as message passing and pre-calculations.
  The constructed tree, as well as the estimation procedure, can be visualized using
  the graphical tools included in the package. An experiment designed to evaluate
  its performance shows that the cat.dt package drastically reduces computational
  time in the creation of CATs without compromising accuracy.
