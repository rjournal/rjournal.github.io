# Introduction

PSF stands for Pattern Sequence Forecasting algorithm. PSF is a
successful forecasting technique based on the assumption that there
exist pattern sequences in the target time series data. For the first
time, it was proposed in @martinez2008lbf, and an improved version was
discussed in @martinez2011energy.

@martinez2011energy improved the label based forecasting (LBF) algorithm
proposed in @martinez2008lbf to forecast the electricity price and
compared it to other available forecasting algorithms such as ANN
[@catalao2007short], ARIMA [@conejo2005day], mixed models
[@garcia2007mixed] and WNN [@lora2007electricity]. These comparisons
concluded that the PSF algorithm is able to outperform all these
forecasting algorithms, at least in the electricity price/demand
context.

Many authors have proposed improvements for PSF. In particular,
@jin2014improved highlighted the PSF algorithm limitations and suggested
minute modification to minimize the computation delay. They suggested
that, instead of using multiple indexes, a single index could make
computation simpler and they used the Davies Bouldin index to obtain the
optimum number of clusters.

@majidpour2014modified compared PSF to kNN and ARIMA, and observed that
PSF can be used for electric vehicle charging energy consumption. It
also proposed three modifications in the existing PSF algorithm. First,
instead of taking average of all the matched template, it only uses the
most recent matched template. Second, if no match was found in the
training data (which is possible), MPSF outputs the cluster center of
the largest cluster as output. Third, instead of finding the optimum
number of clusters starting at two, it starts k from 10% of the total
number of samples to avoid degenerate clusters.

@shen2013ensemble proposed an ensemble of PSF and five variants of the
same algorithm, showing better joint performance when applied to
electricity-related time series data.

@koprinska2013combining attempted to propose a new algorithm for
electricity demand forecast, which is a combination of PSF and Neural
networks (NN) algorithms. The results concluded that PSF-NN is
performing better than original PSF algorithm.

@fujimoto2012pattern modified the clustering method in PSF algorithm. It
used a cluster method based on non-negative tensor factorization instead
of k-means technique and forecasted energy demand using photovoltaic
energy records.

@martinez2011outliers also modified the original PSF algorithm to be
used for outlier occurrence forecasting in time series. The
metaheuristic searches for motifs or pattern sequences preceding certain
data, marked as anomalous in the training set. Then, outlying and
regular data are separately processed. Once again, this version was
shown to be useful in electricity prices and demand.

The analysis of these works highlights the fact that the PSF algorithm
can be applied to many different fields for time series forecasting,
outperforming many existing methods. Since the PSF algorithm consists of
many dependent functions and the authors did not originally publish
their code, the package here described aims at making PSF handy and with
minimum efforts for coding.

The rest of the paper is structured as follows. Section 2 provides an
overview of the PSF algorithm. Section 3 explains how the package in R
has been developed. Illustrative examples are described in Section 4.
Finally, the conclusions drawn from this work are summarized in Section
5.

# Brief description of PSF {#sec:PSF}

The PSF algorithm consists of many processes, which can be divided,
broadly, in two steps. The first step is clustering of data and the
second step is forecasting based on clustered data in earlier step. The
block diagram of PSF algorithm shown in Figure [1](#figure:PSF) was
proposed by @martinez2008lbf. The PSF algorithm is a closed loop
process, hence it adds an advantage since it can attempt to predict the
future values up to long duration by appending earlier forecasted value
to existing original time series data. The block diagram for PSF
algorithm shows the close loop feedback characteristics of the
algorithm. Although there are various strategies for multiple-step ahead
forecasting as described by @Bontempi2013ahead, this strategy turned out
to be particularly suitable for electricity prices and demand
forecasting, as the original work discussed.

Another interesting feature lies in its ability to simultaneously
forecast multiple values, that is, it deals with arbitrary lengths for
the horizon of prediction. However, it must be noted that this algorithm
is particularly developed to forecast time series exhibiting some
patterns in the historical data, such as weather, electricity load or
solar radiation, just to mention few examples of usage in reviewed
literature. The application of PSF to time series without such kind of
inherent patterns might lead to the generation of not particularly
competitive results.

![Figure 1: Block diagram of PSF algorithm
methodology.](Figure_1_new.png){#figure:PSF width="100%" alt="graphic without alt text"}

The clustering part consists of various tasks, including data
normalization, optimum number of clusters selection and application of
k-means clustering itself. The ultimate goal of this step is to discover
clusters of time series data and label them accordingly.

Normalization is one of the essential processes in any time series data
processing technique. Normalization is used to scale data. The algorithm
[@martinez2011energy] used the following transformation to normalize the
data.

$${X_j} = \frac{_{X_j}}{\frac{1}{N}\sum_{i=1}^{N} Xi}$$

where $X_j$ is the input time series data and $N$ is the total length of
the time series.

However, the original PSF original algorithm used $N=24$ hours instead
of N as the total length of the time series. This presents the problem
of knowing all hours for each day to assess the mean. For such reason,
the original formula has been replaced in this implementation by the
standard feature scaling formula (also called unity-based
normalization), which bring all values into the range $[0, 1]$
@dodge2003scaling:

$$X_j' = \frac{ X_j - min(X_i)}{max(X_i) - min(X_i)}$$

where $X_j'$ denotes the normalized value for $X_j$, and
$i=1, \ldots, N$.

The reference articles [@martinez2008lbf] and [@martinez2011energy] used
the k-means clustering technique to assign labels to sets of consecutive
values. In the original manuscript, since daily energy was analyzed,
clustering was applied to every 24 consecutive values, that is, to every
day. The advantage of k-means is its simplicity, but it requires the
number of clusters as input. In @martinez2008lbf, the Silhouette index
was used to decide the optimum numbers of clusters, whereas in the
improved version [@martinez2011energy], three different indexes were
used, which include the Silhouette index [@kaufman2009finding], the Dunn
index [@dunn1974well] and the Davies Bouldin index [@davies1979cluster].
However, the number of groups suggested by each of these indexes in not
necessarily the same. Hence, it was suggested to select the optimum
number of clusters by combining more than one index, thus proposing a
majority voting system.

As output of the clustering process, the original time series data is
converted into a series of labels, which is used as input in the
prediction block of the second phase of the PSF algorithm. The
prediction technique consists of window size selection, searching for
pattern sequences and estimation processes.

Let $x(t)$ be the vector of time series data such that
$x(t) = [x_1(t), x_2(t), \ldots, x_N(t)]$. After clustering and
labeling, the vector converted to $y(t) = [L_1, L_2, \ldots, L_N]$,
where $L_i$ are labels identifying the cluster centers to which data in
vector $x(t)$ belongs to. Note that every $x_i(t)$ can be of arbitrary
length and must be adjusted to the pattern sequence existing in every
time series. For instance, in the original work, $x(i)$ was composed of
24 values, representing daily patterns.

Then the searching process includes the last `W` labels from $y(t)$ and
it searches for these labels in $y(t)$. If this sequence of last `W`
labels is not found in $y(t)$, then the search process is repeated for
last `(W-1)` labels. In PSF, the length of this label sequence is named
as `window size`. Therefore, the window size can vary from `W` to 1,
although it is not usual that this event occurs. The selection of the
optimum window size is very critical and important to make accurate
predictions. The optimum window size selection is done in such a way
that the forecasting error is minimized during the training process.
Mathematically, the error function to be minimized is:

$$\sum_{t\epsilon TS}\left \| \overline{X}(t) - X(t) \right \|$$

where $\overline{X}(t)$ are predicted values and $X(t)$ are original
values of time series data. In practice, the window size selection is
done with cross validation. All possible window sizes are tested on
sample data and corresponding prediction errors are compared. The window
size with minimum error considered as the optimum window size for
prediction.

Once the optimum window size is obtained, the pattern sequence available
in the window is searched for in $y(t)$ and the label present just after
each discovered sequence is noted in a new vector, called `ES`. Finally,
the future time series value is predicted by averaging the values in
vector `ES` as given below:
$$\overline{X}(t) = \frac{1}{size(ES)} \times \sum_{j=1}^{size(ES)} ES(j)$$

where, `size(ES)` is the length of vector `ES`. The procedure of
prediction in the PSF algorithm is described in Figure
[2](#figure:average). Note that the average is calculated with real
values and not with labels.

![Figure 2: Prediction with PSF
algorithm.](Figure_2_new.png){#figure:average width="100%" alt="graphic without alt text"}

The algorithm can predict the future value for next interval of the time
series. But, to make it applicable for long term prediction, the
predicted short term values will get linked with original data and the
whole procedure will be carried out till the desired length of time
series prediction is obtained.

# PSF package description {#sec:Package}

This section introduces the
[*PSF*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=PSF) package in R language
[@bodke17package]. With reference to dependencies, this package imports
package [*cluster*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=cluster)
[@maechler2017package] and suggests packages *knitr* and *rmarkdown*.
The package also needs the
[*data.table*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=data.table) package to
improve data wrangling. PSF package consists of various functions. These
functions are designed such that these can replace the block diagrams of
methodology used in PSF. The block diagram in Figure 3 represents the
methodology mentioned in Figure 1 with the replacement of equivalent
functions used in the proposed package.

The various tasks including the optimum cluster size, window size
selection, pattern searching and prediction processes are performed in
the package with different functions including `psf()`, `predict.psf()`,
`plot.psf()`, `optimum_k()`, `optimum_w()`, `psf_predict()` and
`convert_datatype()`. All functions in the PSF package version 0.4
onwards are made private except for `psf()`, `predict.psf()` and
`plot.psf()` functions, so that users could not use it directly.
Moreover, if users need to change or modify clustering techniques or
procedures in private functions, the code is available at GitHub
(<https://github.com/neerajdhanraj/PSF>).

![Figure 3: Block diagram with PSF package functions replacement for PSF
algorithm.](Figure_3_new.png){#figure:rlogo width="100%" alt="graphic without alt text"}

This section discusses each of these functions and their functionalities
along with simple examples. All functions in the PSF package are loaded
with:

``` r
library(PSF)
```

## Optimum cluster size selection

As aforementioned, clustering of data is one of the initial phases in
PSF. The reference articles [@martinez2008lbf] and [@martinez2011energy]
chose the k-means clustering technique for generating data clusters
according to the time series data properties. The limitation of k-means
clustering technique is that the adequate number of clusters must be
provided by users. Hence, to avoid such situations, the proposed package
contains a function `optimum_k()` which calculates the optimum value for
the number of clusters, (`k`), according to the Silhouette index. This
function generates the optimum cluster size as output. In
@martinez2011energy, multiple indexes (Silhouette index, Dunn index and
the Davies--Bouldin index) were considered to determine the optimum
number of clusters. For the sake of simplicity and to save the
calculation time, only the Silhouette index is considered in this
package, as suggested in @martinez2008lbf.

This `optimum_k()` is a private function which is not directly
accessible by users. This function takes `data` as input time series, in
any format be it matrix, data frame, list, time series or vector. Note
that the input data type must be strictly numeric. This function returns
the optimum value of number of clusters (`k`) in numeric format.

## Optimum window size selection

Once data clustering is performed, the optimum window size needs to be
determined. This is an important but tedious and time consuming process,
if it is manually done. In @martinez2008lbf and @martinez2011energy, the
selection of optimum window size is done through cross--validation, in
which data is partitioned into two subsets. One subset is used for
analysis and the other one for validating the analysis. Since the window
size will always be dependent on the pattern of the experimental data,
it is necessary to determine the optimum window size for every time
series data.

In the PSF package, the optimum window size selection is done with the
function `optimum_w()`, which takes as input the time series data, the
previous estimated $k$ value, a set candidate $w$ values to search in
and the cycle of the input time series. This function estimates the
optimum value for the window size such that the error between predicted
and actual values is minimum. Internally, this function divides the
input time series data into two sub-parts. One of them is the last
`cycle` data values which will be taken as reference to compare to the
predicted values and to calculate RMSE values. The other sub-part is the
remaining data set which is used as training part of the data set. The
predicted values for the window size with minimum RMSE value is then
taken as optimum window size. If more than one window size values are
obtained with the same RMSE values, the maximum window size is preferred
by the function `optimum_w()`. Like the `optimum_k()` function, the
`optimum_w()` function is also a private function and users cannot
directly access it.

## Prediction with PSF

The PSF package exposes three functions to the user. The first one,
`psf()`, can build a PSF model from an univariate time series. The value
returned by such function is a S3 object of class `’psf’`, which
contains both original and normalized input time series along with other
internal model adjustements. Once the PSF model is trained and returned,
the user can invoke the S3 method `predict()` over the the `’psf’`
object specifying the desired number of forecasted values via the
`n.ahead` parameter. This method returns a numeric vector. Finally, the
third function exposed is the S3 method `plot()`, that produces a plot
including both actual and predicted values from a PSF model and a
numeric vector of predictions.

Internally, the prediction procedure is composed of data processing,
optimum window size and cluster size selection. The prediction is done
with the private function `psf_predict()`, which takes time series data,
window size (w), cluster size (`k`) and an integer `n.ahead`. The value
of `n.ahead` indicates the count up to what extend the forecasting is to
be done by function `psf_predict()`. The time series data taken as input
can be in any format supported by R language, be it time series, vector,
matrix, list or data frame. The PSF package automatically converts it in
suitable format using the private function `convert_datatype()` and
proceeds further. All other input parameters `w`, `k` and `n.ahead` must
be in integer format.

The function `psf_predict()` initiates the process of data
normalization. Then, it selects the last `w` labels from the input time
series data and searches for that number sequence in the entire data
set. Additionally, it captures the very next integer value after each
sequence and calculates the average of these values. The obtained
averaged value along with denormalization is considered as raw predicted
value. If the input parameter `n.ahead` is greater than unity, then the
predicted value is appended to the original input data, and the
procedure is repeated `n.ahead` times. Finally, the processed data is
denormalized and returns a time series which replaces labels by the
predicted values.

The `psf_predict()` function is also one of the private functions which
takes input the dataset in data.table format, as well as another integer
inputs including number of clusters (`k`), window size (`w`), horizon of
prediction (`n.ahead`), and the `cycle` parameter, which discovers the
cycle pattern followed by dataset. This function considers all input
parameters and searches for the desired pattern in training data. While
performing the searching process, if the desired pattern is obtained
once or more times, it calculates the average of very next values for
each repeated desired patterns in the whole dataset. Finally, this
averaged value is considered as next predicted value and is appended to
input time series data.

The `psf()` function uses `optimum_k()` and `optimum_w()` functions. The
latter, in turn, uses the described `psf_predict()`. The function
`psf()` returns the PSF trained model (S3 object of class `’psf’`) whose
contents are described later in this section. The syntax for `psf()`
function is shown below:

``` r
psf(data, k = seq(2, 10), w = seq(1, 10), cycle = 24)
```

Within the indicated syntax, the parameter `data` is an univariate time
series in any format, e.g. time series, vector, matrix, list or data
frame. Also, `data` must be strictly provided in numeric format. The
parameter `k` is the number of clusters, whereas parameter `w` is the
window size. Finally, the `cycle` parameter is the number of values that
confirms a cycle in the time series. Usual values for the `cycle`
parameter can be 24 hours per day, 12 months per year or so on and it is
used only when input data is not in the time series format. If input
data is given in time series format, the cycle is automatically
determined by its internal frequency attribute.

If the user provides a single value for either `k` or `w`, then this
value is used in the PSF algorithm and the search for their optimum is
skipped. Furthermore, if the user provides a vector of values for either
parameter `k` or `w`, then the search for optimum is limited to these
values.

This `psf()` function returns a S3 object of class `’psf’` which
includes the 7 elements described below:

original_series

:   Original time series stored to be used internally to build further
    plots.

train_data

:   Adapted and normalized internal time series used to train the PSF
    model.

k

:   The number of clusters optimized and used to train the model.

w

:   The window size optimized and used to train the model.

cycle

:   Determined cycle for the input time series.

dmin

:   Minimum value of the input time series (used to denormalize
    internally in further predictions).

dmax

:   Maximum value of the input time series (used to denormalize
    internally in further predictions).

The `psf()` function initiates the conversion of any type of data format
into *data.table* which is an internal format for this function (this
conversion is carried out by the private function `convert_datatype`).
Secondly, it is checked whether the input dataset is multiple of `cycle`
parameter or not. If not, it generates a warning to state that the
dataset pattern is not suitable for further study. But if the dataset is
multiple of the `cycle` value, the normalization of the dataset is
carried out and subsequently reshaped according to the cycle of time
series.

This reshaped dataset is then provided to `psf_predict()` function with
other parameters including cluster size (`k`), window size (`w`),
`n.ahead` and `cycle`, as mentioned before. In reply to this, the
`psf_predict()` function returns a vector of future predicted values.
Since the input dataset had been previously normalized, it is required
to denormalize the predicted values. This is carried out by the S3
method `predict.psf()`. This function returns a numeric vector with the
denormalized predicted values.

### Plot function for PSF

The `plot.psf()` function allows users to plot both the actual values of
a series and predicted values obtained by a PSF model. This function
takes the trained PSF model, denoted by the first parameter named `x`,
which includes internally the original time series, obtained by `psf()`,
along with the predicted values obtained through `predict.psf()`, and
optionally other plot describing variables, like plot title, legends,
etc. This function generates the plot showing original time series data
and predicted data with significant color changes. The plot obtained by
`plot.psf()` possesses dynamic margin size such that it can include the
input data set and all predicted values as per requirements. The syntax
of `plot.psf()` function is as shown below. The usage of `plot.psf()`
function is further discussed in the next section.

``` r
plot.psf(x, predictions, cycle = 24, ...)
```

# Example {#sec:Example}

This section presents the examples to introduce the use of the PSF
package and to compare it with `auto.arima()` and `ets()` functions,
which are well accepted functions in the R community working over time
series forecasting techniques. The data used in this example are
`nottem` and `sunspots` which are standard time series datasets
available in R. The `nottem` dataset is the average air temperatures at
Nottingham Castle in degrees Fahrenheit, collected for 20 years, on
monthly basis. Similarly, `sunspots` dataset is mean relative sunspot
numbers from 1749 to 1983, measured on monthly basis.

For both datasets, all the recorded values except for the final year are
considered as training data, and the last year is used for testing
purposes. The predicted values for final year for both datasets are
discussed in this section.

In the following examples, model training, forecasting and plotting were
shown for the dataset `nottem`, but the procedure is the same for the
dataset `sunspots`. In first place, the model must be trained using the
PSF package. as is shown below.

``` r
library(PSF)
nottem_model <- psf(nottem)
nottem_model
```

``` r

Once the model is trained, forecasted values for the time series can be
obtained using the S3 method `predict()` function, as is shown below.

``` r
nottem_preds <- predict(nottem_model, n.ahead = 12)
nottem_preds
```

``` r
##  [1] 38.97692 38.71538 42.49231 46.32308 52.91538 57.97692 61.87692
##  [8] 60.19231 57.03846 49.42308 43.23846 40.21538
```

To represent the prediction performance in plot format, the S3 method
`plot()` can be used, as shown in the following code.

``` r
plot(nottem_model, nottem_preds)
```

![Figure 5: Plot showing forecasted results with function `plot.psf()`

Figures [4](#figure:rlogo4) and [5](#figure:rlogo5) show the prediction
with the PSF algorithm for `nottem` and `sunspots` datasets,
respectively. Such results are compared to those of `auto.arima()` and
`ets()` functions from
[*forecast*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=forecast) R package
[@hyndman2017package]. `auto.arima()` function compares either AIC, AICc
or BIC value and suggests best ARIMA or SARIMA models for a given time
series data. Analogously, the `ets()` function considers the best
exponential smoothing state space model automatically and predicts
future values.

`psf()`, `auto.arima()` and `ets()` functions when using the Root Mean
Square Error (RMSE) parameter as metric, for `nottem` and `sunspots`
datasets, respectively. In order to avail more accurate and robust
comparison results, error values are calculated for 10 times and the
mean value of error values for methods under comparison are shown in
Tables [1](#tab:label1) and [2](#tab:label2). These tables clearly state
that `psf()` function is able to outperform the comparative time series
prediction methods.

Additionally, the reader might want to refer to the results published in
the original work [@martinez2011energy], in which it was shown that PSF
outperformed many different methods when applied to electricity prices
and demand forecasting.

# Conclusions {#sec:Conclusions}

This article is a thorough description of the PSF R package. This
package is introduced to promote the algorithm Pattern Sequence based
Forecasting (PSF) which was proposed by @martinez2008lbf and then
modified and improved by @martinez2011energy. The functions involved in
the PSF package can be tested with time series data in any format like
vector, time series, list, matrix or data frame. The aim of the PSF
