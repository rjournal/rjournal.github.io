title: 'PSF: Introduction to R Package for Pattern Sequence Based Forecasting Algorithm'
abstract: 'This paper introduces the R package that implements the Pattern Sequence
  based Forecasting (PSF) algorithm, which was developed for univariate time series
  forecasting. This algorithm has been successfully applied to many different fields.
  The PSF algorithm consists of two major parts: clustering and prediction. The clustering
  part includes selection of the optimum number of clusters. It labels time series
  data with reference to such clusters. The prediction part includes functions like
  optimum window size selection for specific patterns and prediction of future values
  with reference to past pattern sequences. The PSF package consists of various functions
  to implement the PSF algorithm. It also contains a function which automates all
  other functions to obtain optimized prediction results. The aim of this package
  is to promote the PSF algorithm and to ease its usage with minimum efforts. This
  paper describes all the functions in the PSF package with their syntax. It also
  provides a simple example. Finally, the usefulness of this package is discussed
  by comparing it to auto.arima and ets, well-known time series forecasting functions
  available on CRAN repository.'
