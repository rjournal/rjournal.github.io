title: 'ROSE: a Package for Binary Imbalanced Learning'
abstract: The ROSE package provides functions to deal with binary classification problems
  in the presence of imbalanced classes. Artificial balanced samples are generated
  according to a smoothed bootstrap approach and allow for aiding both the phases
  of estimation and accuracy evaluation of a binary classifier in the presence of
  a rare class. Functions that implement more traditional remedies for the class imbalance
  and different metrics to evaluate accuracy are also provided. These are estimated
  by holdout, bootstrap or cross-validation methods.
