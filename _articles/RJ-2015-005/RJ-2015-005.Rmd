title: 'Frames2: A Package for Estimation in Dual Frame Surveys'
abstract: Data from complex survey designs require special consideration with regard
  to estimation of finite population parameters and corresponding variance estimation
  procedures, as a consequence of significant departures from the simple random sampling
  assumption. In the past decade a number of statistical software packages have been
  developed to facilitate the analysis of complex survey data. All these statistical
  software packages are able to treat samples selected from one sampling frame containing
  all population units. Dual frame surveys are very useful when it is not possible
  to guarantee a complete coverage of the target population and may result in considerable
  cost savings over a single frame design with comparable precision. There are several
  estimators available in the statistical literature but no existing software covers
  dual frame estimation procedures. This gap is now filled by package Frames2. In
  this paper we highlight the main features of the package. The package includes the
  main estimators in dual frame surveys and also provides interval confidence estimation.
