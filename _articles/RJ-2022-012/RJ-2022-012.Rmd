title: 'RFpredInterval: An R Package for Prediction Intervals with Random Forests
  and Boosted Forests'
abstract: ' Like many predictive models, random forests provide point predictions
  for new observations. Besides the point prediction, it is important to quantify
  the uncertainty in the prediction. Prediction intervals provide information about
  the reliability of the point predictions. We have developed a comprehensive R package,
  [RFpredInterval](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=RFpredInterval), that integrates
  16 methods to build prediction intervals with random forests and boosted forests.
  The set of methods implemented in the package includes a new method to build prediction
  intervals with boosted forests (PIBF) and 15 method variations to produce prediction
  intervals with random forests, as proposed by [@roy_prediction_2020]. We perform
  an extensive simulation study and apply real data analyses to compare the performance
  of the proposed method to ten existing methods for building prediction intervals
  with random forests. The results show that the proposed method is very competitive
  and, globally, outperforms competing methods. '
