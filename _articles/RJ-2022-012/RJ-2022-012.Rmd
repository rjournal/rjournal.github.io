# Introduction

Predictive modelling is the general concept of building a model that
describes how a group of covariates can be used to predict a response
variable. The objective is to predict the unknown responses of
observations given their covariates. For example, predictive models
could be used to predict the sale price of houses given house
characteristics [@de_cock_ames_2011]. In its simplest form, a predictive
model aims to provide a point prediction for a new observation. However,
a point prediction does not contain information about its precision that
can tell us how close to the true response we can expect the prediction
to be, which is often important in decision-making context. Hence,
although the point prediction is often the main goal of predictive
analysis, assessing its reliability is equally important, and this can
be achieved with a prediction interval (PI). A PI contains a set of
likely values for the true response with an associated level of
confidence, usually, $90\%$ or $95\%$. Given that shorter PIs are more
informative, developing predictive models that can produce shorter PIs
along with the point predictions is crucial in assessing and quantifying
the prediction error. In real-world applications, knowing the prediction
error alongside the point prediction increases the practical value of
the prediction.

Regression analysis is a form of predictive modelling technique that
examines the relationship between a response variable and a group of
covariates. In this paper, we consider a general regression model
$$\label{eq:regression}
Y = g\left(X\right)+\epsilon$$ where $Y$ is a univariate continuous
response variable, $X$ is a *p*-dimensional vector of predictors, and
$\epsilon$ is an error term. We assume $g\left(.\right)$ is an unknown
smooth function $\Re^p \rightarrow \Re$ and
$E\left[Y|X=x\right] = g\left(X\right)$. A confidence interval of the
prediction is a range likely to contain the location of the response
variable's true population mean. However, a prediction interval for a
new observation is wider than its corresponding confidence interval and
provides a range likely to contain this new observation's response
value.

In the past decade, random forests have increased in popularity and
provide an efficient way to generate point predictions for model
[\[eq:regression\]](#eq:regression){reference-type="eqref"
reference="eq:regression"}. A random forest is an ensemble method
composed of many decision trees, which can be described with a simple
algorithm [@breiman_random_2001]. For each tree
$b=\left \{1,..., B\right \}$, a bootstrap sample of observations is
drawn and a fully grown tree is built such that a set of predictors is
randomly selected at each node and the best split is selected among all
possible splits with those predictors only. The random forest prediction
for a new observation is the average of the $B$ trees
$$\hat{y}^{}_{new} = \frac{1}{B} \sum_{b=1}^{B}\hat{y}^b_{new}$$ where
$\hat{y}^b_{new}$ is the tree prediction for the new observation in the
$b$th tree, i.e. the average of observations in the terminal node
corresponding to the new observation. Besides this traditional
description, the modern view also considers random forests as
data-driven weight generators
[@hothorn_bagging_2004; @lin_random_2006; @moradian_l1_2017; @moradian_survival_2019; @athey_generalized_2019; @roy_prediction_2020; @tabib_non-parametric_2020; @alakus_conditional_2021].

Although random forests limit over-fitting by combining many trees,
which reduces the variance of the estimator, final predictions can be
biased [@mentch_quantifying_2016; @wager_estimation_2018]. Since each
tree is built under the same random process, all trees focus on the same
part of the response signal, usually the strongest. Therefore, some
parts of the response signal may be left untargeted, which could result
in biased point predictions. @wager_estimation_2018 provide bounds for
the extent of the bias of random forests under some assumptions about
the tree growing process. Following their work, @ghosal_boosting_2021
proposed a bias correction method in a regression framework called
*one-step boosted forest*, which is introduced in @breiman_random_2001
and @zhang_bias-corrected_2012. The main idea of the proposed method is
to sum the predictions of two random forests, where the first is a
regression forest fitted on the target data set and the second is fitted
on the out-of-bag residuals of the former. Empirical studies show that
this method provides a significant bias reduction when compared to a
simple random forest.

The current paper proposes an R package providing, among other features,
an extension of the one-step boosted forest method described above
[@ghosal_boosting_2021]. The literature on prediction intervals for
random forests consists mostly of recent studies. The first method is
the Quantile Regression Forests (QRF) method proposed by
@meinshausen_quantile_2006. The aim of QRF is to estimate conditional
quantiles of the response variable, instead of conditional means, using
an estimated cumulative distribution function obtained with the nearest
neighbour forest weights introduced by @hothorn_bagging_2004. Prediction
intervals can be built directly from the estimated conditional
quantiles. The method is implemented in the CRAN package
[quantregForest](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=quantregForest)
[@R-quantregForest].

In a more recent study, @athey_generalized_2019 proposed Generalized
Random Forests (GRF), a very general framework to estimate any quantity,
such as conditional means, quantiles or average partial effects,
identified by local moment equations. Trees are grown with splitting
rules designed to maximize heterogeneity with respect to the quantity of
interest. Quantile regression forest is one of the applications of GRF.
Similar to the QRF, the GRF method uses the neighbourhood information
from different trees to compute a weighted set of neighbours for each
test point. Unlike QRF, which grows trees with the least-squares
criterion, GRF uses a splitting rule designed to capture heterogeneity
in conditional quantiles. An implementation of quantile regression
forest with GRF is available in the function quantile_forest of the CRAN
package [grf](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=grf) [@R-grf].

@vovk_algorithmic_2005 [@vovk_-line_2009] introduced a general
distribution-free conformal prediction interval framework. Any
predictive model, including random forests, can be used within the
proposed methodology. The idea is to use an augmented data set that
includes the new observation to be predicted to fit the model, and apply
a set of hypothesis tests to provide an error bound around the point
prediction for the new observation. Although this method does not
require any distribution assumptions, it is computationally intensive.
@lei_distribution-free_2018 proposed a variant of this method, called
Split Conformal (SC) prediction, which splits the data into two subsets,
one to fit the model, and one to compute the quantiles of the residual
distribution. We note that, while the original full conformal prediction
interval framework produces shorter intervals, SC is computationally
more efficient. The R package conformalInference
[@R-conformalInference], available on GitHub, implements this method.

@roy_prediction_2020 proposed 20 distinct variations of methods to
improve the performance of prediction intervals with random forests.
These approaches differ according to 1) the method used to build the
forest and 2) the method used to build the prediction interval. Four
methods can be used to build the forest: three from the classification
and regression tree (CART) paradigm [@breiman_classification_1984] and
the transformation forest method (TRF) proposed by
[@hothorn_predictive_2021]. Within the CART paradigm, in addition to the
default least-squares (LS) splitting criterion, two alternative
splitting criteria, $L_1$ and shortest prediction interval (SPI), are
considered. Prediction intervals are built using the Bag of Observations
for Prediction (BOP), which is the set of nearest neighbour observations
previously used in @moradian_l1_2017 [@moradian_survival_2019]. In
addition to the type of forest chosen, there are also five methods to
build prediction intervals: the classical method (LM), the quantile
method (Quant), the shortest prediction interval (SPI), the highest
density region (HDR), and the contiguous HDR (CHDR). LM is computed
based on an intercept-only linear model using the BOP as the sample, and
produces a symmetric PI around the point prediction. The quantile
method, similar to the QRF method, is based on the quantiles of the BOP.
SPI corresponds to the shortest interval among the intervals that
contain at least $\left(1-\alpha\right)100\%$ of the observations in the
BOP. As an alternative to SPI, HDR is the smallest region in the BOP,
with the desired coverage $\left(1-\alpha\right)$. Note that HDR is not
necessarily a single interval. If the distribution is multimodal, it can
be formed by multiple intervals. Finally, CHDR is a way to obtain a
single prediction interval from HDR intervals by building an interval
with the minimum and maximum bounds of the HDR intervals.

@zhang_random_2020 proposed a forest-based prediction interval method,
called Out-of-Bag (OOB) prediction intervals, to estimate prediction
intervals using the empirical quantiles of the out-of-bag prediction
errors. The method assumes that OOB prediction errors are identically
distributed and that their distribution can be well approximated by the
out-of-bag prediction errors obtained from all training observations.
The resulting prediction intervals have the same width for all test
observations. The method is implemented in the CRAN package
[rfinterval](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=rfinterval)
[@R-rfinterval].

@lu_unified_2021 proposed a very interesting and useful method to
estimate the conditional prediction error distribution of a random
forest. The main idea of the proposed method is to use a random forest
to compute the out-of-bag residuals for the training observations and to
form a set of out-of-bag neighbours for each test point. Then, the
conditional prediction error distribution for each test point is
determined with the out-of-bag residuals in the neighbourhood.
Estimating the prediction error distribution enables the estimation of
conditional quantiles, conditional biases and conditional mean squared
prediction errors. The prediction interval for a test point $x$, defined
by $\widehat {PI}_{\alpha}\left(x\right)$, is formed by adding the
$\alpha/2$ and $1-\alpha/2$ quantiles of the conditional prediction
error distribution to the random forest point prediction. The estimators
are implemented in the CRAN package
[forestError](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=forestError)
[@R-forestError].

Note that the conformal inference, OOB approach of @zhang_random_2020
and the $\widehat {PI}_{\alpha}\left(x\right)$ method of
[@lu_unified_2021] all use the prediction errors to build the prediction
intervals. Instead of using the training responses directly to estimate
quantiles, using prediction errors provides a better predictive power.
However, unlike conformal inference and the OOB approach, the
$\widehat {PI}_{\alpha}\left(x\right)$ method uses the nearest neighbour
observations to estimate the prediction error distribution. This idea is
very similar to the BOP idea [@roy_prediction_2020], but instead of
using in-bag observations, @lu_unified_2021 use out-of-bag observations
to form the neighbourhoods. This approach allows the local information
for the test observations to be extracted.

In this paper, we introduce the R package RFpredInterval
[@R-RFpredInterval], which is the novel implementation of 16 methods to
build prediction intervals with random forests and boosted forests. The
set of methods implemented in the package includes a new method to build
prediction intervals with boosted forests and 15 method variations
(three splitting rules with the CART paradigm which are LS, $L_1$ and
SPI, and five methods to build prediction intervals which are LM, SPI,
Quant, HDR and CHDR) proposed by @roy_prediction_2020. These 15 methods
had been thoroughly investigated before through simulation studies and
with real data sets in @roy_prediction_2020. However, they are not
easily available to use. One of the main contributions of our package is
the implementation of these competitive methods and the ability for
users to compare various prediction interval methods within the same
package. The other main contribution of our paper is a new method to
build prediction intervals. Contrary to the 15 methods proposed by
@roy_prediction_2020, the newly introduced method was not tested before.
That is why in the paper we placed a greater emphasis on investigating
the new method through extensive simulation studies and with real data.
For performance comparison purposes, we compared the new method to 10
existing methods which include:

-   5 of the 15 implemented method variations of @roy_prediction_2020;
    see the Competing methods subsection for details.

-   5 other competing methods from the literature: Quantile Regression
    Forests (QRF), Generalized Random Forests (GRF), Split Conformal
    prediction method (SC), Out-of-Bag (OOB) prediction intervals method
    and $\widehat {PI}_{\alpha}\left(x\right)$ method.

The new proposed method to build Prediction Intervals with Boosted
Forests is called PIBF. This approach integrates the idea of using the
nearest neighbour out-of-bag observations to estimate the conditional
prediction error distribution presented in @lu_unified_2021 to the
one-step boosted forest proposed by @ghosal_boosting_2021. We will show
in this paper that PIBF significantly improves the performance of
prediction intervals with random forests when compared with 10 existing
methods using a variety of simulated and real benchmark data sets.

The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In the next section, we
describe the algorithm implemented in PIBF. We then present the details
of the package and provide a practical and reproducible example. We also
perform a simulation study to compare the performance of our proposed
method to existing competing methods, and we investigate the performance
of the proposed method with real data sets. Lastly, we conclude with a
discussion of the results.

# Method and implementation

The proposed method is based on the one-step boosted forest method
proposed by @ghosal_boosting_2021. It consists in fitting two regression
random forests: the first is fitted to get point predictions and
out-of-bag (OOB) residuals using the given data set, whereas the second
is fitted to predict those residuals using the original covariates. As
empirical studies demonstrate, the one-step boosted forest provides
point predictions with reduced bias compared to the simple random
forest. @ghosal_boosting_2021 use subsampling for their theoretical
investigations, even though random forests were originally described
with bootstrap samples and obtain notable performance improvements. They
have also investigated the effect of using bootstrapping with the
one-step boosted forest on the bias estimations. From the results
presented in their appendix, the use of bootstrapping yields the best
performance and reduces the bias the most in exchange for an increase in
their proposed variance estimator, which is defined under asymptotic
normality. In this paper, we use bootstrapping for the one-step boosted
forest method following the better performance results on bias
reduction. The final prediction for a new observation, $x_{new}$, is the
sum of the predictions from the two random forests
$$\hat y^{*}_{new} = \hat y^{}_{new} + \hat \epsilon^{}_{new}$$ where
$\hat y^{}_{new}$ is the point prediction obtained from the first random
forest and $\hat \epsilon^{}_{new}$ is the bias estimation from the
second forest.

Besides bias correction, we use the second random forest as a way to
construct a prediction interval by finding the nearest neighbour
observations that are close to the one we want to predict. The idea of
finding the nearest neighbour observations, a concept very similar to
the 'nearest neighbour forest weights'
[@hothorn_bagging_2004; @lin_random_2006], was introduced in
[@moradian_l1_2017] and later used in [@moradian_survival_2019],
[@roy_prediction_2020], [@tabib_non-parametric_2020] and
[@alakus_conditional_2021]. For a new observation, the set of in-bag
training observations that are in the same terminal nodes as the new
observation forms the set of nearest neighbour observations.
[@roy_prediction_2020] called this set of observations the Bag of
Observations for Prediction (BOP). We can define the BOP for a new
observation $x_{new}$ as $$\label{eq:bop}
    BOP\left(x_{new}\right) = \bigcup\limits_{b=1}^{B} I_b\left(x_{new}\right)$$
where $I_b\left(x_{new}\right)$ is the set of in-bag training
observations, *i.e.*, observations in the bootstrap sample that are in
the same terminal node as $x_{new}$ in the $b^{th}$ tree.
$I_b\left(.\right)$ consists of the training observations that are in
the bootstrap sample of the $b^{th}$ tree.

Instead of forming the set of nearest neighbour observations with the
in-bag training observations, we can use the out-of-bag observations
which are not in the bootstrap sample, as used in @lu_unified_2021. We
can define the out-of-bag equivalent of the BOP for a new observation
$x_{new}$ [\[eq:bop\]](#eq:bop){reference-type="eqref"
reference="eq:bop"} as $$\label{eq:bop2}
    BOP^{*}\left(x_{new}\right) = \bigcup\limits_{b=1}^{B} O_b\left(x_{new}\right)$$
where $O_b\left(x_{new}\right)$ is the set of out-of-bag observations
that are in the same terminal node as $x_{new}$ in the $b^{th}$ tree.
$O_b\left(.\right)$ consists of the training observations that are not
in the bootstrap sample of the $b^{th}$ tree.

Out-of-bag observations are not used in the tree growing process. Thus,
for the trees where the training observations are out-of-bag, they are
like the unobserved test observations for those trees. The only
difference is that, for a new observation, we use all the trees in the
forest whereas for an out-of-bag observation we have only a subset of
the forest trees. By using the out-of-bag equivalent of the BOP for a
new observation, we can make use of the analogy between the out-of-bag
observations and test observations. The out-of-bag neighbours of a new
observation represent the new observation better than the in-bag
neighbours.

Any desired measure can be obtained by using the constructed BOPs. In
this paper, we use the BOP idea to build a prediction interval for a
test observation. For a new observation with covariates $x_{new}$, we
firstly form $BOP^{*}\left(x_{new}\right)$
[\[eq:bop2\]](#eq:bop2){reference-type="eqref" reference="eq:bop2"}
using the out-of-bag neighbours. Then, as proposed by @lu_unified_2021,
we estimate the conditional prediction error distribution,
$\hat{F}\left(x_{new}\right)$, but now with the bias-corrected
out-of-bag residuals of the observations in
$BOP^{*}\left(x_{new}\right)$. Lastly, we build a prediction interval
for the new observation as
$$PI\left(x_{new}\right) = \left[\hat y^{*}_{new} + SPI^l_{\alpha}\left(\hat{F}\left(x_{new}\right)\right), \hat y^{*}_{new} + SPI^u_{\alpha}\left(\hat{F}\left(x_{new}\right)\right)\right]$$
where $\hat y^{*}_{new}$ is the bias-corrected prediction,
$SPI^l_{\alpha}\left(\hat{F}\left(x_{new}\right)\right)$ and
$SPI^u_{\alpha}\left(\hat{F}\left(x_{new}\right)\right)$ are the lower
and upper bounds of the
$SPI_{\alpha}\left(\hat{F}\left(x_{new}\right)\right)$, which is the
shortest interval formed by the observations in
$BOP^{*}\left(x_{new}\right)$ that contains at least
$\left(1-\alpha\right)100\%$ of the observations. By using the
bias-corrected residuals to form prediction error distribution and
picking the shortest interval among the qualified intervals, we can
expect narrower prediction intervals.

We can summarize the steps of the proposed method as follows:

1.  Train the first regression RF with covariates $X$ to predict the
    response variable $Y$, and get the OOB predictions $\hat Y_{oob}$

2.  Compute the OOB residuals as
    $\hat \epsilon_{oob}^{} = Y-\hat Y_{oob}^{}$

3.  Train the second regression RF with covariates $X$ to predict the
    OOB residuals $\hat \epsilon_{oob}^{}$, and get the OOB predictions
    for residuals $\hat{\hat \epsilon}_{oob}^{}$

4.  Update the OOB predictions as
    $\hat Y_{oob}^* = \hat Y_{oob}^{} + \hat{\hat \epsilon}_{oob}^{}$

5.  Compute the updated OOB residuals after bias-correction as
    $\hat \epsilon_{oob}^{*} = Y - \hat Y_{oob}^*$

6.  For a new observation $x_{new}$, get the point predictions
    $\hat y_{new}$ from the first RF, and get the predicted residuals
    $\hat \epsilon_{new}$ from the second RF, then the final prediction
    for the new observation is
    $$\hat y_{new}^{*} = \hat y_{new}^{} + \hat \epsilon_{new}^{}$$
    where $\hat \epsilon_{new}^{}$ is the estimated bias.

7.  Form a BOP for $x_{new}$ with the OOB neighbours using the second
    RF, $BOP^{*}\left(x_{new}\right) \eqref{eq:bop2}$ and estimate the
    conditional prediction error distribution for $x_{new}$ as,
    $$\hat{F}\left(x_{new}^{}\right) = \left \{\hat \epsilon_{oob,i}^{*} | i \in BOP^{*}\left(x_{new}\right)\right \}$$

8.  Build a PI for $x_{new}$ as
    $PI\left(x_{new}\right) = \left[\hat y^{*}_{new} + SPI^l_{\alpha}\left(\hat{F}\left(x_{new}\right)\right), \hat y^{*}_{new} + SPI^u_{\alpha}\left(\hat{F}\left(x_{new}\right)\right)\right]$

## Calibration

The principal goal of any prediction interval method is to ensure the
desired coverage level. In order to attain the desired coverage level
$\left(1-\alpha\right)$, we may need a calibration procedure. The goal
of the calibration is to find the value of $\alpha_w$, called the
working level in @roy_prediction_2020, such that the coverage level of
the PIs for the training observations is closest to the desired coverage
level. @roy_prediction_2020 presented a calibration procedure that uses
the BOPs that are built using only the trees where the training
observation $x_i$ is OOB. The idea is to find the value of $\alpha_w$
using the OOB-BOPs. In this paper, we call this procedure OOB
calibration.

We also include a cross-validation-based calibration procedure with the
proposed method to acquire the desired $\left(1-\alpha\right)$ coverage
level. In this calibration, we apply $k$-fold cross-validation to form
prediction intervals for the training observations. In each fold, we
split the original training data set into training and testing sets. For
the training set, we go through the steps 1-5 defined above. Then, for
each observation in the testing set, we apply steps 6-8 and build a PI.
After completing CV, we compute the coverage level with the constructed
PIs and if the coverage is not within the acceptable coverage range,
then we apply a grid search to find the $\alpha_w$ such that $\alpha_w$
is the closest to the target $\alpha$ among the set of $\alpha_w$'s.
Once we find the $\alpha_w$, we use this level to build the PI for the
new observations.

## The RFpredInterval package

In our package, we implement 16 methods that apply random forest
training. Ten of these methods have specialized splitting rules in the
random forest growing process. These methods are the ones with $L_1$ and
shortest prediction interval (SPI) splitting rules proposed by
@roy_prediction_2020. To implement these methods, we have utilised the
custom split feature of the
[randomForestSRC](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=randomForestSRC)
package [@R-randomForestSRC].

The randomForestSRC package allows users to define a custom splitting
rule for the tree growing process. The user needs to define the
customized splitting rule in the splitCustom.c file with C-programming.
After modifying the splitCustom.c file, all C source code files in the
package's src folder must be recompiled. Finally, the package must be
re-installed for the custom split rule to become available.

In our package development process, we froze the version of
randomForestSRC to the latest one available at the time, which is
version 2.11.0, to apply specialized splitting rules. After defining the
$L_1$ and SPI splitting rules, all C files were re-compiled. Finally,
all package files including our R files for prediction interval methods
were re-built to make the package ready for the user installation.

The RFpredInterval package has two main R functions as below:

-   pibf(): Constructs prediction intervals with the proposed method,
    PIBF.

-   rfpi(): Constructs prediction intervals with 15 distinct variations
    proposed by @roy_prediction_2020.

Table [\[table:methods\]](#table:methods){reference-type="ref"
reference="table:methods"} presents the list of functions and methods
implemented in RFpredInterval. For pibf(), RFpredInterval uses the CRAN
package [ranger](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=ranger) [@R-ranger]
to fit the random forests. For rfpi(), RFpredInterval uses
randomForestSRC package. For the least-squares splitting rule, both
randomForestSRC and ranger packages are applicable.

::: widetable
:::

In this section, we illustrate the usage of the RFpredInterval package
with the Ames Housing data set [@de_cock_ames_2011]. The data set was
introduced as a modern alternative to the well-known Boston Housing data
set. The data set contains many explanatory variables on the quality and
quantity of physical attributes of houses in Ames, IA sold from 2006 to
2010. Most of the variables give information to a typical home buyer who
would like to know about a house (*e.g.* number of bedrooms and
bathrooms, square footage, heating type, lot size, etc.).

The [AmesHousing](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=AmesHousing)
[@R-AmesHousing] package contains the raw data and processed versions of
the Ames Housing data set. The raw data contains 2930 observations and
82 variables, which include 23 nominal, 23 ordinal, 14 discrete, and 20
continuous variables, involved in assessing house values. The processed
version of the data set has 2330 observations and 81 variables,
including the target variable Sale_Price representing the value of
houses in US dollars. The usual goal for this data set is to predict the
sale price of each house given covariates.

We load the processed version of the Ames Housing data set from the
AmesHousing package and prepare the data set that we will use for the
analyses. The preprocessing steps are presented in the Supplementary
Material. This version of the data set contains 22 factors and 59
numeric variables, including 1 response variable Sale_Price, for 2929
observations. We split the data set into training and testing samples.

::: example*
set.seed(3456) n \<- nrow(AmesHousing) trainindex \<- sample(1:n, size =
round(0.7\*n), replace = FALSE) traindata \<- AmesHousing\[trainindex,
\] testdata \<- AmesHousing\[-trainindex, \]
:::

We fit a random forest with 1000 trees using the training data and
construct $95\%$ prediction intervals for the observations in the
testing data with the proposed method. We apply 5-fold cross-validation
based calibration and set the acceptable coverage range to
$\left[.945,.955\right]$. We can pass the list of random forest
parameters for ranger package.

::: example*
out \<- pibf(formula = Sale_Price   ., traindata = traindata, testdata =
testdata, alpha = 0.05, calibration = \"cv\", numfolds = 5,
coverage_range = c(0.945, 0.955), params_ranger = list(num.trees =
1000), oob = TRUE)
:::

We can then analyze the constructed PIs and bias-corrected random forest
predictions for the testing data, as shown below. The PI output is a
list containing lower and upper bounds. For example, we can print the
point prediction and prediction interval for the tenth observation in
the testing data.

We can also print the summary output. In the summary output, we can
always see the mean PI length over the test data set. If calibration is
applied, we can see the working level of $\alpha$. If the test data set
has true response information, as in our example, coverage and
prediction errors for the test set are also printed. Moreover, since we
have entered oob = TRUE in the function arguments, in the summary output
we can see the mean PI length and coverage measures along with the
prediction errors for the training set. The prediction intervals are
built with the out-of-bag (OOB) predictions and prediction errors.

::: example*
print(out)

\> alpha_w: 0.050 \> Mean PI length: 73.081 \> Coverage: 96.8 \> MAE of

train predictions: 14.179 \> RMSE of OOB train predictions: 23.875
:::

Next, we construct $95\%$ prediction intervals using the variations
proposed by @roy_prediction_2020. In the following example, the
splitting is rule is set to $L_1$ and we want to apply LM, Quant and SPI
methods for building prediction intervals. We apply OOB calibration and
set the acceptable coverage range to $\left[.945,.955\right]$. We can
pass the the list of random forest parameters for randomForestSRC
package.

::: example*

1000), params_calib = list(range = c(0.945, 0.955)), oob = FALSE)
:::

We can analyze the constructed PIs for the testing data as below. Each
PI output is a list containing lower and upper bounds. For instance, we
can print the point prediction and LM prediction interval for the tenth
observation in the testing data.

::: example*

:::

We print the summary output. In the summary output, we can see the
splitting rule selected in the first row. Since the test data set has
true responses in our example, we can see the coverage information for
the selected PI methods besides the mean PI length and $\alpha_w$ in the
printed table. Below the table, we have the mean prediction errors for
the test set.

\> MAE of test predictions: 14.605 \> RMSE of test predictions: 22.603
:::

Although, with the pibf() and rfpi() functions, we have more flexibility
to set the arguments for the methods, we can build prediction intervals
with all 16 methods implemented in the package with the piall()
function. We will build 95% prediction intervals for the test set.

::: example*
out3 \<- piall(formula = Sale_Price   ., traindata = traindata, testdata

The output is a list of constructed prediction intervals with 16 methods
and point predictions obtained with the PIBF method, LS, $L_1$, and SPI
split rules. Hence, the output includes 16 prediction intervals and 4
point predictions which is a list of 20 items in total.

We print the summary output.

Lastly, we plot the constructed prediction intervals with all 16
methods, for the 15th observation in the test set.

prediction interval(s) for the test observation. If the true response of
the test observation is known, it is demonstrated with a dashed vertical

PI method. As we can see from the figure, we may have four different
point predictions for the same test observation. The PIBF method and the
three splitting rules LS, $L_1$ and SPI can produce different point
predictions. But all PI method variations for the same splitting rule
have the same point prediction.

# Simulation study

In this section, we compare the predictive performance of the prediction
intervals constructed with our proposed method to the existing methods
presented in the Introduction using a variety of simulated and real
benchmark data sets.

## Simulation design

We apply a simulation study based on seven simulated data sets from the
literature. The first three of the data sets are Friedman's benchmark
regression problems described in @jerome_h_friedman_multivariate_1991
and @breiman_bagging_1996. We use the CRAN package
[mlbench](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=mlbench) [@R-mlbench] to
generate these data sets.

In Friedman Problem 1, the inputs are 10 independent variables uniformly
distributed on the interval $\left[0,1\right]$. The first five
covariates are used to generate the response:
$$y = 10 \sin\left(\pi x_1 x_2\right) + 20 \left(x_3 - 0.5\right)^2 + 10 x_4 + 5 x_5 + \epsilon$$
where $\epsilon$ is $N\left(0,\sigma^2\right)$ and the default standard
deviation of $\epsilon$ is 1 which yields a signal-to-noise ratio (SNR)
(*i.e.*, the ratio of the standard deviation of signal to the standard
deviation of error) of 4.8:1.

In Friedman Problem 2, the response is generated as
$$y = \left(x_1^2 + \left(x_2 x_3 - \frac{1}{x_2 x_4}\right)^2\right)^{0.5} + \epsilon$$
where the inputs are four independent variables uniformly distributed
over the ranges $$\begin{aligned}
    0 \leq &x_1 \leq 100 \\
    40 \pi \leq &x_2 \leq 560 \pi \\
    0 \leq &x_3 \leq 1\\
    1 \leq &x_4 \leq 11\end{aligned}$$ and $\epsilon$ is
$N\left(0,\sigma^2\right)$. The default value of 125, which yields a SNR
of 3:1, is used for the standard deviation of $\epsilon$.

In Friedman Problem 3, the inputs are four independent variables
uniformly distributed over the same ranges as Friedman Problem 2. The
response is generated as
$$y = \arctan{\left(\frac{x_2 x_3 - \frac{1}{x_2 x_4}}{x_1}\right)} + \epsilon$$
where $\epsilon$ is $N\left(0,\sigma^2\right)$ and the default value of
0.01 for the standard deviation of $\epsilon$ is used, which yields a
SNR of 3:1.

The fourth data set is the Peak Benchmark Problem which is also from the
mlbench package. Let $r=3u$ where $u$ is uniform on $\left[0,1\right]$
and let $x$ be uniformly distributed on the *d*-dimensional sphere of
radius $r$. The response is $y=25\exp\left(-0.5r^2\right)$. The default
value of $d=20$ dimensions is used.

The fifth one is a modification of Friedman Problem 1, which was used in
@hothorn_predictive_2021 in their H2c setup. This data set was designed
to have heteroscedasticity. The inputs are 10 independent variables
uniformly distributed on the interval $\left[0,1\right]$. The first five
covariates are used in the mean function and the unscaled mean function
is defined as
$$\mu = 10 \sin\left(\pi x_1 x_2\right) + 20 \left(x_3 - 0.5\right)^2 + 10 x_4 + 5 x_5$$
Then, the scaled mean function on the interval $\left[-1.5,1.5\right]$
is
$$\mu^{S} = \frac{3\left(\mu - \mu_{min}\right)}{\mu_{max} - \mu_{min}}-1.5$$
where $\mu_{min}$ and $\mu_{max}$ are the minimum and maximum values of
$\mu$ over the sample. The last five covariates are used in the standard
deviation function and the unscaled standard deviation function is
$$\sigma = 10 \sin\left(\pi x_6 x_7\right) + 20 \left(x_8 - 0.5\right)^2 + 10 x_9 + 5 x_{10}$$
The standard deviation is scaled as
$$\sigma^{S}=\exp\left(\frac{3\left(\sigma-\sigma_{min}\right)}{\sigma_{max}-\sigma_{min}}-1.5\right)$$
where $\sigma_{min}$ and $\sigma_{max}$ are the minimum and maximum
values of $\sigma$ over the sample. The response is generated as a
normal random variable with mean $\mu^{S}$ and standard deviation
$\sigma^{S}$.

The last two data sets, which were used in @roy_prediction_2020, have a
tree-based response variable. The inputs are seven independent variables
generated from the standard normal distribution. The response is
generated with the seven covariates according to a tree model with a
depth of three, with eight terminal nodes: $$\begin{aligned}
    y = & u_1 I\left(x_1<0, x_2<0, x_4<0\right)\\
        & + u_2 I\left(x_1<0, x_2<0, x_4 \geq 0\right)\\
        & + u_3 I\left(x_1<0, x_2 \geq 0, x_5<0\right)\\
        & + u_4 I\left(x_1<0, x_2 \geq 0, x_5 \geq 0\right)\\
        & + u_5 I\left(x_1 \geq 0, x_3<0, x_6<0\right)\\
        & + u_6 I\left(x_1 \geq 0, x_3<0, x_6 \geq 0\right)\\
        & + u_7 I\left(x_1 \geq 0, x_3 \geq 0, x_7<0\right)\\
        & + u_8 I\left(x_1 \geq 0, x_3 \geq 0, x_7 \geq 0\right) + \epsilon\end{aligned}$$
where the terminal node means are
$u=\left(5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40\right)$ and $I$ is the indicator
function. The difference in the two data sets is the distribution of the
error. In the first one, $\epsilon$ is generated from a standard normal
distribution and in the other it is from an exponential distribution
with mean 1. The signal-to-noise ratio is 11.5:1 for both data sets.

We use training sample sizes of
$n_{train}=\left \{200,500,1000,5000\right \}$, resulting in 28
scenarios. Each scenario is repeated 500 times. In each run, we generate
an independent test set of new observations with $n_{test}= 1000$.

## Competing methods

We compare our proposed prediction interval estimator with 10 competing
methods which were presented in the Introduction. The first is the
$\widehat{PI}_\alpha$ method. We fit the random forest with the ranger
package and use the forestError package to build PIs. The second is the
OOB method. The rfinterval package is used. The third is the split
conformal method. The conformalInference package is used. The fourth is
the QRF method and the quantregForest package is used. The fifth is the
GRF method. The function quantile_forest in the grf package is used.

The last five are variations of @roy_prediction_2020. To compare the
performance of the method variations, a comprehensive simulation study
and real data analyses were performed in [@roy_prediction_2020]. One of
the biggest conclusions from these comparison studies was that, among
the three alternative splitting criteria within the CART paradigm, the
impact of the choice of the splitting rule on the performance of the
prediction intervals was moderate whereas the selection of the PI method
had a much greater impact on the performance. Hence, in this simulation
study, we set up the splitting rule to the least-squares (LS) and only
compare the five PI methods: LM, Quant, SPI, HDR, and CHDR. For those
methods, the rfpi() function of the RFpredInterval package is used. We
fit the random forest with the ranger package.

## Parameter settings

For the simulations, we use the following parameters. For all methods,
we set the number of trees to 2000. Letting $p$ be the number of
covariates, then the number of covariates to randomly split at each
node, *mtry*, is set to $\max\left \{\lfloor p/3 \rfloor,1\right \}$
(except for the GRF method). For the GRF method, following
@athey_generalized_2019, $mtry$ is set to
$\min\left \{\lceil \sqrt{p}+20 \rceil,p\right \}$. Also, we use the
honest splitting regime with the default fraction of 0.5 for the GRF
method. The minimum node size parameter for all forests is set to 5. The
desired coverage is set to $95\%$ for all methods. For the proposed
method, we perform the cross-validation-based calibration as the primary
calibration procedure, but we also investigate the OOB calibration. For
the method variations in @roy_prediction_2020, we perform the OOB
calibration procedure as they proposed. For both calibration procedures,
the acceptable range of coverage is set to $\left[.945,.955\right]$.
Calibration is not performed for the competing methods since no option
for calibration is offered in their CRAN packages.

## Performance with the simulated data sets

We can evaluate the performance of the competing methods with two
measures: the mean coverage and the mean prediction interval length.
Table [\[table:simulations\]](#table:simulations){reference-type="ref"
reference="table:simulations"} presents the average coverage rate of
each method on the test set over 500 replications for a given simulated
data set and sample size, with average mean prediction interval lengths
shown in parentheses. The principal goal of any prediction interval
method is to ensure the desired coverage level. In this simulation
study, the desired coverage level is set to $95\%$ for all methods. The
left plot in
Figure [\[figure:global\]](#figure:global){reference-type="ref"
reference="figure:global"} shows the mean coverages over the 28
scenarios for all methods. Overall, all of the methods, except the QRF
and GRF methods which tend to be conservative, provide a mean coverage
close to the desired level. QRF and GRF methods have an average mean
coverage of 0.975 and 0.974 over all scenarios, respectively. Although
the $\widehat{PI}_\alpha$ method has an average of the mean coverages of
0.957, close to the desired level, its variability is large. Over 308
(11 methods $\times$ 28 scenarios) average coverage values, there is
only one case where the mean coverage is below 0.94. It corresponds to
the $\widehat{PI}_\alpha$ method in Friedman Problem 2 with
$n_{train}=5000$.

Once the prediction intervals provide the desired coverage level, the
next goal of any PI method is to provide the shortest PI length. Prior
to carrying out a detailed comparison of interval lengths, we can
globally compare the interval lengths over all scenarios with the
percentage increase in mean PI length of a method with respect to the
best method for a given run. For a given run, define $ml_{i}$ as the
mean PI length of method $i$ and $ml^{*}$ as the shortest mean PI length
over the 10 competing methods. The percentage increase in PI length for
method $i$ is computed as
$100 \times \left(ml_i - ml^{*}\right)/ml^{*}$. Smaller values for this
measure indicate better performances. The right plot in
Figure [\[figure:global\]](#figure:global){reference-type="ref"
reference="figure:global"} presents the relative lengths of the methods
across 14,000 runs (28 scenarios $\times$ 500 replications). The
prediction intervals with the GRF method are the widest, followed by the
QRF method. However, as we saw in the left plot in
Figure [\[figure:global\]](#figure:global){reference-type="ref"
reference="figure:global"}, GRF and QRF produce conservative prediction
intervals, so their PI lengths cannot be fairly compared to the other
methods with a coverage closer to 0.95. Based on the global results, the
proposed method, PIBF, performs the best. Following PIBF,
$\widehat{PI}_\alpha$, OOB, LM, SPI, HDR and CHDR perform similarly
well, with $\widehat{PI}_\alpha$ being slightly better. Among the
variations of @roy_prediction_2020, the PIs with quantiles produce
longer prediction intervals than the other four variations.

![image](global_simulated.pdf)
:::

Now, we investigate the performance of the methods separately for each
scenario. See figures S1 to S7 in the Supplementary Material for the
mean PI length results of each method for each simulated data set. Each
figure has four facets corresponding to the four levels of the training
sample size. For all methods and data sets, the mean PI lengths and
their variability decrease as the sample size increases (except the GRF
method for the tree-based data sets). We see that for Friedman Problem
1, from Figure S1, for all sample sizes, PIBF consistently outperforms
the 10 competing methods in terms of mean PI length while ensuring the
desired coverage level (see
Table [\[table:simulations\]](#table:simulations){reference-type="ref"
reference="table:simulations"} for the mean coverage results). QRF and
GRF provide the widest prediction intervals for all sample sizes.
However, as presented in
Table [\[table:simulations\]](#table:simulations){reference-type="ref"
reference="table:simulations"}, these methods heavily over-cover and are
therefore not comparable with the other methods. While the
$\widehat{PI}_\alpha$ method also slightly over-covers, it has shorter
PIs than other methods.

For Friedman Problem 2 (see Figure S2 in the Supplementary Material), we
see that the proposed method has the shortest mean PI length for the
smallest sample size, and as the sample size increases
$\widehat{PI}_\alpha$ provides shorter PIs. However, we should also take
into account the mean coverages presented in
Table [\[table:simulations\]](#table:simulations){reference-type="ref"
reference="table:simulations"}. The proposed method has smaller coverage
levels for $n_{train}=200$ compared to $\widehat{PI}_\alpha$, but as the
sample size increases the coverage levels decrease for the
$\widehat{PI}_\alpha$ method (up to 0.937 for $n_{train}=5000$) whereas
PIBF keeps it around 0.945. For $n_{train}=5000$, the OOB method builds
shorter PIs while ensuring the desired coverage level. Again, QRF and
GRF have the widest PIs for all sample sizes due to their conservative
PIs.

The performance of PIBF and $\widehat{PI}_\alpha$ is very similar for
Friedman Problem 3 (see Figure S3 in the Supplementary Material). Both
methods provide the shortest PIs with similar coverage levels and mean
PI lengths. Results for the Peak Benchmark Problem presented in Figure
S4 are very similar to those of Friedman Problem 1. For all sample
sizes, PIBF consistently outperforms the 10 competing methods in terms
of mean PI length. But this time, SPI method with LS splitting rule
comes in second place.

For the H2c setup (see Figure S5 in the Supplementary Material), which
is the modification of Friedman Problem 1, we can see that all methods
are comparable since QRF and GRF do not over-cover. In this setting, all
methods also perform fairly well with respect to PI length. Overall, the
LM prediction interval method with the LS splitting rule provides
slightly shorter PIs.

For the tree-based data sets (see figures S6 and S7 in the Supplementary
Material), overall, it seems that the distribution of the error does not
have a significant effect on the results. Again, QRF and GRF have
conservative PIs. Unlike the other data sets, we see here that the mean
PI lengths of the GRF method decrease very slowly as the sample size
increases. For $n_{train}=5000$, all methods (except QRF and GRF)
perform similarly. For the smallest sample size, HDR PI building methods
and the proposed method perform slightly better than other methods. As
the sample size increases, PIBF produces the shortest prediction
intervals.

## Effect of calibration on the performance of prediction intervals

In this section, we investigate the effect of the proposed calibration
on performance of the prediction intervals. We apply the same simulation
study using the seven simulated data sets. We compare the results of the
proposed method without calibration, with OOB calibration and
calibration with cross-validation. The desired coverage level is set to
95%. In Figure [2](#figure:calib){reference-type="ref"
reference="figure:calib"}, the left plot presents the mean coverages
over 28 scenarios for the three variations, and the right plot shows the
percentage increase in mean PI length of each of the three calibration
variants across 14,000 runs (28 scenarios $\times$ 500 replications).
Although we obtain the shortest prediction intervals without
calibration, the variability of the mean coverage level is larger and
sometimes the coverage falls below 0.94. Looking at the left plot, we
can say that the variability of the mean coverage level decreases with
both calibration procedures. However, applying OOB calibration provides
conservative PIs. The median of the mean coverage level is more than
0.96 and the PIs with the OOB calibration are the widest. Applying
calibration with CV produces slightly longer PIs than those with no
calibration, but these PIs have coverage levels closer to the desired
level.

In the package, both calibration procedures are implemented for the PIBF
method. Simulation study results show that, compared to the OOB
calibration, calibration with CV produces shorter PIs while maintaining
the desired coverage level. Therefore, the default calibration procedure
is set to CV in the pibf() function. In terms of computational time (see
tables [\[table:timesim\]](#table:timesim){reference-type="ref"
reference="table:timesim"} and
[\[table:timereal\]](#table:timereal){reference-type="ref"
reference="table:timereal"}), calibration with $k$-fold CV is slower
than OOB calibration since it needs to fit two additional random forests
for each fold.

outlier values are distorting the scales, they are removed.

## Performance with real data sets

To further explore the performance of the prediction intervals built
with the proposed method, we use 11 real data sets. Since two of the
data sets have two response variables, we consider that we are analyzing
13 real data sets. Boston housing and Ames housing data sets are from
the R packages mlbench and AmesHousing, respectively. The other data
sets are obtained through the UCI Machine Learning Repository
[@ucirepo].

For each data set, we apply 100 times 10-fold cross-validation for each
method. Hence, for each fold, the training and testing sets correspond
to 90% and 10% of the whole data set, respectively. The desired coverage
level is set to 95% for all methods.
Table [\[table:realdata\]](#table:realdata){reference-type="ref"
reference="table:realdata"} presents the results of the real data
analyses (*n* is the number of observations and *p* is the number of
predictors) with the average coverage rate of each method over 100
repetitions, and mean prediction interval lengths averaged over 100
repetitions shown in parentheses.
Figure [\[figure:globalreal\]](#figure:globalreal){reference-type="ref"
reference="figure:globalreal"} illustrates the global results of the
analyses across datasets. The left plot in
Figure [\[figure:globalreal\]](#figure:globalreal){reference-type="ref"
reference="figure:globalreal"} shows the mean coverages over the 13 real
data sets for all methods. Similar to what we have seen with the
simulated data sets, the QRF and GRF methods produce conservative
prediction intervals, whereas the other methods provide a mean coverage
close to the desired level. Again, the $\widehat{PI}_\alpha$ method
maintains the target level on average with 0.959, but its variability is
the highest among all methods. Across all data sets, there are three
cases where the mean coverage is below 0.94: the proposed method for
Concrete slump, and the $\widehat{PI}_\alpha$ method for Auto MPG and
Computer hardware.

The right plot in
Figure [\[figure:globalreal\]](#figure:globalreal){reference-type="ref"
reference="figure:globalreal"} presents the relative lengths of methods
across 13 real data sets. For each method, there are 13 points in the
boxplot, and each point corresponds to the percentage increase in mean
PI length compared to the best method for a single real data set. Again,
the prediction intervals with GRF and QRF are the widest among eleven
methods. Among the other nine methods, the proposed method performs the
best, followed by $\widehat{PI}_\alpha$.

For each real data set, we analyze the performance of each method
through the mean PI lengths presented in figures S8 to S10 in the
Supplementary Material. For the Abalone data set, the HDR method
produces the shortest prediction intervals, followed by the SPI and
Quant methods. While the QRF method over-covers, its PIs are no wider
than those of most of the other methods. The proposed method, PIBF, is
distinctly the best prediction interval method yielding the shortest PI
lengths for the Air quality data set with absolute and relative humidity
response variables, Airfoil selfnoise, Ames housing, Boston housing,
Concrete compression, Energy efficiency data set with cooling and
heating load response variables, and Servo data sets. In the Auto MPG
data set, $\widehat{PI}_\alpha$ has the shortest mean PI length but with
a mean coverage of 0.929. Among the other methods, PIBF, OOB, LM, Quant
and SPI methods show similarly good performances while maintaining the
desired coverage level. For the Computer hardware data set, PIBF,
$\widehat{PI}_\alpha$, and SPI methods perform better than the other
methods. They have similar mean PI lengths. For the Concrete slump data
set, the proposed method has the shortest mean PI length, but with a
slightly smaller coverage of 0.939. This data set is the only one of the
simulated and real data sets where the proposed method has a mean
coverage below 0.94. After PIBF, $\widehat{PI}_\alpha$ and LM show a
good performance with a mean coverage close to the target level.
Overall, we can conclude that the proposed method shows better
performance than the 10 competing methods for almost all of the real
data sets.

## Comparison of the computational times

All simulations and real data analyses were conducted in R version 3.6.0
on a Linux machine with Intel(R) Xeon(R) E5-2667 v3 @ 3.20GHz with 396
GB of memory. The average computational time of each method for the
simulated and real data sets are presented in
tables [\[table:timesim\]](#table:timesim){reference-type="ref"
reference="table:timesim"} and
[\[table:timereal\]](#table:timereal){reference-type="ref"
reference="table:timereal"}. For the proposed method (PIBF), the
computational times for both calibration methods, cross-validation and
OOB, are presented in the tables. We can see from the tables that, for
most of the data sets, calibration with cross-validation has longer
running times than OOB calibration, which is expected since with the
*k*-fold cross-validation, we fit $2k$ more random forests than applying
OOB calibration.

For the variations of [@roy_prediction_2020], since we can build
prediction intervals with the five PI methods by only fitting a single
random forest with a selected splitting rule, we present the total
computational time for building the five variations under RFPI. To be
clear, for a given splitting rule, the rfpi() function fits a random
forest and then the set of PI methods requested by the user are applied
to the output of the random forest. In our simulations, we choose to
return all five PI methods for the selected splitting rule, *i.e.* when
we measure the running time of the rfpi() function, we get the total
running time of building five prediction intervals. Therefore, we should
interpret the values for RFPI with care while comparing the
computational times of the methods. Although not all PI methods have
similar computational complexities, we can say that even the average
time of building prediction intervals with one of these variations,
assuming they have similar running times, is reasonable. Since, for the
HDR-based PI methods, an optimal bandwidth has to be chosen, which is a
time-consuming process, among the five PI methods, the slowest ones are
the HDR and CHDR. From the remaining variations, the classical method,
LM, is the fastest, followed by the Quant and SPI methods.

For both the simulations and real data analyses, the OOB and GRF methods
have the smallest running times. For most of the methods, the increase
in the sample size has a mild effect on the ratio of increase in running
times. However, for the split conformal method with the simulated data
sets, running times increase more than the proportional increase in
sample sizes. Similarly, we can see that the QRF method is also affected
from the training sample size as it rises to 5000.

# Concluding remarks

In this paper, we have introduced an R package named RFpredInterval.
This package implements 16 methods to build prediction intervals with
random forests: a new method to build Prediction Intervals with Boosted
Forests (PIBF) and 15 different variations to produce prediction
intervals with random forests proposed by @roy_prediction_2020. PIBF
provides bias-corrected point predictions obtained with the one-step
boosted forest and prediction intervals by using the nearest neighbour
out-of-bag observations to estimate the conditional prediction error
distribution.

We performed an extensive simulation study with a variety of simulated
data sets and applied real data analyses to investigate the performance
of the proposed method. The performance was evaluated based on the
coverage level and length of the prediction intervals. We compared the
performance of the proposed method to 10 existing methods for building
prediction intervals with random forests. The proposed method was able
to maintain the desired coverage level with both the simulated and real
data sets. In terms of the PI lengths, globally, the proposed method
provided the shortest prediction intervals among all methods. The
conclusions drawn from the analysis of real data sets were very similar
to those with the simulated data sets. This provides evidence for the
reliability of the proposed method. All results obtained indicate that
the proposed method can be used with confidence for a variety of
regression problems.

Note that the coverage rate of prediction intervals for new observations
can have several interpretations. An interesting discussion about this
issue is given in @mayr_prediction_2012. In that paper, the authors
presented two interpretation of coverage: sample coverage and
conditional coverage. Sample coverage means that if we draw a new sample
from the same population as the training sample and build PIs with a
desired coverage level of $\left(1-\alpha\right)$, then the global
coverage rate over this sample will be $\left(1-\alpha\right)$. The
conditional coverage means that if we sample many new observations
always having the same set of covariates and build PIs for them with a
desired coverage level of $\left(1-\alpha\right)$, then about
$\left(1-\alpha\right)100\%$ of these prediction intervals will contain
the true value of the response. To hold a desired level of conditional
coverage, the predictive method needs to provide the desired coverage
level over the entire covariate space. On the other hand, sample
coverage needs only maintain the desired coverage level over the new
sample, on average. Therefore, if the conditional coverage holds, then
the sample coverage also holds. In practice, predictive models are
mostly evaluated with their global predictive performance. Hence,
ensuring that the sample coverage level is achieved should be sufficient
for most applications. The proposed calibration method with
cross-validation is designed to ensure the sample coverage property.
From the simulation study and real data analyses, we can see that the
sample coverage is attained with the proposed calibration method.
