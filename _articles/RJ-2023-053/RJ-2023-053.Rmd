title: Identifying Counterfactual Queries with the R Package cfid
abstract: ' In the framework of structural causal models, counterfactual queries describe
  events that concern multiple alternative states of the system under study. Counterfactual
  queries often take the form of "what if" type questions such as "would an applicant
  have been hired if they had over 10 years of experience, when in reality they only
  had 5 years of experience?" Such questions and counterfactual inference in general
  are crucial, for example when addressing the problem of fairness in decision-making.
  Because counterfactual events contain contradictory states of the world, it is impossible
  to conduct a randomized experiment to address them without making several restrictive
  assumptions. However, it is sometimes possible to identify such queries from observational
  and experimental data by representing the system under study as a causal model,
  and the available data as symbolic probability distributions. @shpitser2007 constructed
  two algorithms, called ID\* and IDC\*, for identifying counterfactual queries and
  conditional counterfactual queries, respectively. These two algorithms are analogous
  to the ID and IDC algorithms by @shpitser2006id [@shpitser2006idc] for identification
  of interventional distributions, which were implemented in R by @tikka2017 in the
  causaleffect package. We present the R package [cfid](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=cfid)
  that implements the ID\* and IDC\* algorithms. Identification of counterfactual
  queries and the features of cfid are demonstrated via examples. '
