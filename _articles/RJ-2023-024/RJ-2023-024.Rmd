title: 'gplsim: An R Package for Generalized Partially Linear Single-index Models'
abstract: Generalized partially linear single-index models (GPLSIMs) are important
  tools in nonparametric regression. They extend popular generalized linear models
  to allow flexible nonlinear dependence on some predictors while overcoming the "curse
  of dimensionality." We develop an R package gplsim that implements efficient spline
  estimation of GPLSIMs, proposed by [@yu_penalized_2002] and [@yu_penalised_2017],
  for a response variable from a general exponential family. The package builds upon
  the popular mgcv package for generalized additive models (GAMs) and provides functions
  that allow users to fit GPLSIMs with various link functions, select smoothing tuning
  parameter $\lambda$ against generalized cross-validation or alternative choices,
  and visualize the estimated unknown univariate function of single-index term. In
  this paper, we discuss the implementation of gplsim in detail, and illustrate the
  use case through a sine-bump simulation study with various links and a real-data
  application to air pollution data.

# Introduction

A popular approach to analyzing the relationship between a response
variable and a set of predictors is generalized linear models or GLMs
[@mccullagh_generalized_1989], where the conditional mean of the
response variable is linked to a linear combination of predictors via a
link function. Although GLMs are simple and easy to interpret, in many
complex real data applications the underlying assumption of linearity is
often violated. Generalized partially linear single-index models
(GPLSIMs) [e.g.
@carroll_generalized_1997; @yu_penalized_2002; @yu_penalised_2017] are
flexible semiparametric models that allow for a non-linear relationship
while retaining ease of interpretation. In particular, GPLSIMs include a
partial linear component $\mathbf{z} \boldsymbol{\gamma}$, and
importantly a nonparametric single-index component, effectively reducing
the dimensionality of $p$-dimensional predictors $\mathbf{x}$ to a
univariate single index $\mathbf{x}^{T} \boldsymbol{\theta}$ with a
flexible univariate function $\phi(\mathbf{x}^{T} \boldsymbol{\theta})$,
avoiding the "curse of dimensionality\" in multivariate nonparametric
regression. GPLSIMs reduce to popular single-index models
[@ichimura_semiparametric_1993; @hardle_optimal_1993; @xia_semi-parametric_2006]
when there are no partial linear terms. Another popular special case is
partially linear models [@hardle_partially_2012] when there is only one
predictor in the nonparametric component.

GPLSIMs and the reduced models have been studied extensively in the
literature. Applications lie in various fields, for example, discrete
choice analysis, dose-response models, credit scoring, Framingham heart
study [@yu_penalised_2017 and references therein]. [@yu_penalized_2002],
[@xia_semi-parametric_2006], and [@liang_estimation_2010] studied
partially linear single-index models for continuous responses. For
responses from a general exponential family, [@carroll_generalized_1997]
proposed local linear approach via quasi-likelihood for GPLSIMs
estimation. However, as noted in [@yu_penalized_2002], the algorithm
using local linear methods in [@carroll_generalized_1997] may suffer
from some computational issues and can become unstable.
[@yu_penalized_2002] proposed a stable and computationally expedient
approach using penalized splines (P-splines) with non-linear least
square minimization. [@yu_penalised_2017] further proposed an efficient
profile likelihood algorithm for the P-splines approach to GPLSIMs.

We develop a package gplsim[^1] in R [@R2021] using splines for
efficient estimation of the unknown univariate function in GPLSIMs
following [@yu_penalized_2002] and [@yu_penalised_2017]. The gplsim R
package mainly implements the profile likelihood estimation method
described in [@yu_penalised_2017], utilizing the function gam
[@Wood_fast_2011] from the state-of-the-art R package mgcv
[@wood_mgcv_2001]. The model class gplsim extends on the gam for
straightforward computation and implementation. A side benefit is that
our gplsim package enjoys improvements and features as those made to the
mgcv package. For example, mgcv 1.5 added smoothness selection method
"REML" and "ML" in addition to "GCV" to its core function "gam()", and
gplsim can enjoy those new features naturally. Similarly, any spline
basis adopted in mgcv package, such as the thin plate regression spline
basis, is also available in our gplsim package. In addition, our gplsim
package also implements the simultaneous non-linear least square
minimization methods for continuous responses from [@yu_penalized_2002]
as an alternative option.

The mgcv package for generalized additive models (GAMs) is indeed a
fundamental building block for our gplsim package. GAMs
[@Hastie1986; @Wood_fast_2011] are popular semiparametric models, which
replaces the single-index components by summation of individual smooth
functions. As noted in @carroll_generalized_1997 and @yu_penalized_2002,
GPLSIMs are more parsimonious and can model some interactions. However,
GPLSIMs are nonlinear and more difficult to estimate, especially given
the widely available software for GAMs. One may view GAMs as a special
case of GPLSIMs when the single-index coefficients are known.
Alternatively, one may view GPLSIMs as special GAMs models with a
nonlinear single-index effect. Single-index models can also be viewed as
the base of more complex models, such as multi-index models
[@xia_multiple_index_2008], projection pursuit regression
[@hall_projection_1989] and deep neural networks
[@yang_high_dimensional_2017].

The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In the next section, we
review the GPLSIMs and the penalized spline estimation for GPLSIMs.
Next, we discuss the estimation algorithm implemented in this package.
The following section describes the main features of the functions
provided. The section "real data and simulation examples" illustrates
the use of gplsim in R via an air pollution example and a sine-bump
simulation study. The last section summarizes the method and presents
directions for future research and application.

# An overview of generalized partially linear single-index models

## The GPLSIMs

For given predictor vectors of $p$-dimensional $X=\mathbf{x}$ and
$q$-dimensional $Z=\mathbf{z}$, and under the assumption that the
conditional density of the response variable $Y$ arises from a general
exponential family, the conditional mean $E(Y|\mathbf{x}, \mathbf{z})$
can be modeled by
$$E(Y|\mathbf{x}, \mathbf{z}): = \mu(\mathbf{x}, \mathbf{z}) = g^{-1}\{\phi\left(\mathbf{x}^{T} \boldsymbol{\theta}\right)+\mathbf{z} \gamma\},
 \label{eq:GPLSIM}$$ where the single-index parameter
$\boldsymbol{\theta}$ maps the $p$-dimensional predictors $\mathbf{x}$
to a univariate single index $\mathbf{x}^{T} \boldsymbol{\theta}$ by a
linear projection, and $\phi(\cdot)$ is a univariate unknown function,
while $g\{\cdot\}$ is a known link function. The parameter vector is
constrained such that $\left\|\boldsymbol{\theta}\right\|=1$ with first
element $\theta_1$ positive for identifiability [@yu_penalized_2002].

One of the main challenges to estimate
model ([\[eq:GPLSIM\]](#eq:GPLSIM){reference-type="ref"
reference="eq:GPLSIM"}) is that the $p$-dimensional single-index
parameter $\boldsymbol{\theta}$ is nested within the unknown univariate
function $\phi(\cdot)$, and hence a highly nonlinear problem.

## Review of penalized spline estimation for GPLSIMs

When the single-index parameter $\boldsymbol{\theta}$ or the
single-index $u=\mathbf{x}^{T} \boldsymbol{\theta}$ is given, we can
estimate the unknown univariate function $\phi(\cdot)$ with penalized
splines [@ruppert2003semiparametric] such that
$\phi(u) \approx \mathbf{H}(u)\boldsymbol{\beta}$. The systematic
component of GPLSIMs can then be approximated by
$$g\{\mu(\mathbf{x}, \mathbf{z})\}=\mathbf{H}(\mathbf{x}^{T} \boldsymbol{\theta}) \boldsymbol{\beta}+\mathbf{z} \boldsymbol{\gamma},$$
where $\mathbf{H}(\cdot)$ is the spline basis, and $\boldsymbol{\beta}$
is the spline coefficient vector. We denote
$\boldsymbol{\omega}=\left(\boldsymbol{\theta}, \boldsymbol{\beta}, \boldsymbol{\gamma}\right)$
as the column parameter vector.

There are many choices of the spline basis functions
$\mathbf{H}({\cdot})$, such as B-spline, truncated power basis,
thin-plate spline, and their variations. For simplicity, we first
illustrate using a truncated power basis of degree $d$:
$$\begin{aligned}
  \mathbf{H}(u) \boldsymbol{\beta} =\beta_{0}+\beta_{1} u+\cdots+\beta_{d} u^{d}+\sum_{k=1}^{K} \beta_{d+k}\left(u-v_{k}\right)_{+}^{d}, 
  \end{aligned}$$ where
$\mathbf{H}(u)=\left\{1, u, \ldots, u^{d},\left(u-v_{1}\right)_{+}^{d}, \ldots,\left(u-v_{K}\right)_{+}^{d}\right\}$
are spline bases with $K$ interior knots placed at
$\left(v_{1}, \ldots, v_{K}\right)$. Quadratic or cubic splines are
commonly used. The interior knots are usually placed at equally-spaced
quantiles within the domain.

Another popular choice of spline basis is the B-spline basis. Any
B-spline basis functions $\mathbf{H}({\cdot})$ of degree higher than 0,
can be defined by the following Cox-de Boor recursion formula
[@boor_practical_2001]:
$$\mathrm{H}_{k, \mathrm{d}}(u)=\frac{u-u_{k}}{u_{k+d-1}-u_{k}} \mathrm{H}_{k, d-1}(u)+\frac{u_{k+d}-u}{u_{k+d}-u_{k+1}} \mathrm{H}_{k+1, d-1}(u),$$
where $$\mathrm{H}_{k, 0}(u)=\left\{\begin{array}{ll}
  1, & \mathrm{u}_{k} \leq u \leq u_{k+1} \\
  0, & \text { otherwise. }
  \end{array}\right.$$ One of the appealing features of the B-spline is
that, unlike truncated power basis, B-spline basis functions have local
supports that can result in high numerical stability.

To avoid overfitting, a roughness penalty controlled by a smoothing
parameter $\lambda$ is applied to the log-likelihood. Specifically, we
can obtain the penalized log-likelihood estimator of
$\boldsymbol{\omega}$ by maximizing the following penalized
log-likelihood function: $$\begin{aligned}
  Q_{n, \lambda}(\boldsymbol{\omega})=& \frac{1}{n} L_{n}(\boldsymbol{\omega})-\frac{1}{2} \lambda \boldsymbol{\beta}^{\top} \mathbf{D} \boldsymbol{\beta} \\
  =& \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n}\left[y_{i} \xi\left(\mathbf{x}_{i}, \mathbf{z}_{i} ; \boldsymbol{\omega}\right)-b\left\{\xi\left(\mathbf{x}_{i}, \mathbf{z}_{i} ; \boldsymbol{\omega}\right)\right\}\right] -\frac{1}{2} \lambda \boldsymbol{\beta}^{\top} \mathbf{D} \boldsymbol{\beta},
 \label{eq:plike}
\end{aligned}$$ where $\xi$ is the natural parameter in generalized
linear models,
$\mu(\mathbf{x}_{i}, \mathbf{z}_{i})  = b^{\prime}\left\{\xi\left(\mathbf{x}_{i}, \mathbf{z}_{i} ; \boldsymbol{\omega}\right)\right\}$,
for observations $i=1,\cdots,n$, and $\mathbf{D}$ is a positive
semidefinite symmetric penalty matrix. Common penalty matrices include
the usual quadratic integral penalty on second derivatives of
$\phi(\cdot)$ or alternatively the diagonal penalty matrix with its last
$K$ diagonal elements constrained to equal to one and the rest equal to
zero [see e.g. @ruppert_theory_2000; @yu_penalized_2002], which in
effect penalizes the coefficients of the truncated power basis at the
jump of $d$-th derivatives.

Maximizing the penalized log-likelihood
function ([\[eq:plike\]](#eq:plike){reference-type="ref"
reference="eq:plike"}) can be achieved in several ways. We mainly focus
on implementing an efficient profile log-likelihood method in
[@yu_penalised_2017]. We also present an option to implement a
simultaneous nonlinear least square method in [@yu_penalized_2002].

The selection of smoothing parameter $\lambda$ is important as it
controls the tradeoff between over-smoothing (possible underfitting) and
under-smoothing (possible overfitting). We use an outer iteration to
select $\lambda$ against some selection criterion, as recommended by
[@Wood_fast_2011]. For the default choice, we adopt generalized cross
validation (GCV) to select the smoothing parameter $\lambda$.
Alternatively, we can consider maximum likelihood (ML)
[@anderssen_time_1974] or restricted maximum likelihood (REML)
[@wahba_comparison_1985] based approaches. A nice feature is that we can
directly adopt criteria that have been provided by the "gam()" function
arguments from R package mgcv, which is one of the main components in
the implementation of our gplsim estimation algorithm.

## Algorithm

We present the main algorithm for fitting the generalized partially
linear single-index models (GPLSIMs) with penalized splines estimation
with profile likelihood in detail as follows:

::: algorithm
Obtain an initial estimate $\hat{\boldsymbol{\theta}}^{(0)}$ of the
single-index parameter $\boldsymbol{\theta}$ from a generalized linear
model (default), or a user-provided initial list.

With an estimate of ${\boldsymbol{\theta}}$ (equivalently, the single
index
$\left\{u_{i}=\mathbf{x}^{T}_{i} {\boldsymbol{\theta}}: i=1, \ldots, n\right\}$
), the spline coefficient ${\boldsymbol{\beta}}$ and partially linear
coefficient ${\boldsymbol{\gamma}}$ can be written as implicit functions
of ${\boldsymbol{\theta}}$ to maximize penalized log-likelihood:
$$\begin{array}{l}
    Q\left(\boldsymbol{\beta}, \boldsymbol{\gamma}, \lambda ; u_{1}, \ldots, u_{n}\right) \\
    =\frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n}\left[y_{i} \xi\left(u_{i}, \mathbf{z}_{i} ; \boldsymbol{\beta}, \boldsymbol{\gamma}\right)-b\left\{\xi\left(u_{i}, \mathbf{z}_{i} ; \boldsymbol{\beta}, \boldsymbol{\gamma}\right)\right\}\right] \\
    \quad-\frac{1}{2} \lambda \boldsymbol{\beta}^{\top} \mathbf{D} \boldsymbol{\beta}.
    \end{array}$$ The roughness penalty parameter $\lambda$ is selected
using generalized cross-validation score (default) or alternative
options.

Given the spline coefficient vector
$\widehat{\boldsymbol{\beta}}_{\lambda}(\boldsymbol{\theta})$ and
partially linear coefficient vector
$\widehat{\boldsymbol{\gamma}}_{\lambda}(\boldsymbol{\theta})$ as
implicit functions of ${\boldsymbol{\theta}}$, obtain the profile
log-likelihood estimator of the single-index parameter
$\boldsymbol{\theta}$ by maximizing: $$\begin{aligned}
    Q(\boldsymbol{\theta})=& \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n}\left[y_{i} \xi\left(\mathbf{x}^{T}_{i} \boldsymbol{\theta}, \mathbf{z}_{i} ; \widehat{\boldsymbol{\beta}}_{\lambda}(\boldsymbol{\theta}), \widehat{\boldsymbol{\gamma}}_{\lambda}(\boldsymbol{\theta})\right)\right.\\
    &\left.-b\left\{\xi\left(\mathbf{x}^{T}_{i} \boldsymbol{\theta}, \mathbf{z}_{i} ; \widehat{\boldsymbol{\beta}}_{\lambda}(\boldsymbol{\theta}), \widehat{\boldsymbol{\gamma}}_{\lambda}(\boldsymbol{\theta})\right)\right\}\right].
  \end{aligned}$$

With the estimated profile log-likelihood estimator
$\widehat{\boldsymbol{\theta}}$ of the single-index parameter, obtain
the final estimator $\widehat{\boldsymbol{\beta}}$ of spline coefficient
and $\widehat{\boldsymbol{\gamma}}$ of partially linear coefficient via
step 2.

Obtain the final fitted response vector $\widehat{\mathbf{y}}$ from
model ([\[eq:GPLSIM\]](#eq:GPLSIM){reference-type="ref"
reference="eq:GPLSIM"}).
:::

Alternatively, for continuous responses under the default assumption of
$family=gaussian$, maximizing the penalized log-likelihood estimator
equation ([\[eq:plike\]](#eq:plike){reference-type="ref"
reference="eq:plike"}) is equivalent to minimizing the penalized sum of
squared errors: $$\begin{aligned}
\frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n}\left\{y_{i} - \mathbf{H}(\mathbf{x}^{T}_{i} \boldsymbol{\theta}) \boldsymbol{\beta} - \mathbf{z}_{i}\boldsymbol{\gamma}\right\}^{2} + \frac{1}{2} \lambda \boldsymbol{\beta}^{\top} \mathbf{D} \boldsymbol{\beta}.
\end{aligned}$$ For the simultaneous non-linear least square
minimization methods in [@yu_penalized_2002], we can directly apply a
standard nonlinear least square (NLS) optimization algorithm on
minimization of the above penalized sum of squared errors with respect
to the full parameter
$\boldsymbol{\omega}=\left(\boldsymbol{\theta}, \boldsymbol{\beta}, \boldsymbol{\gamma}\right)$.
This is useful to facilitate joint inferences as described in
[@yu_penalized_2002]. This algorithm as presented in
[@yu_penalized_2002] is also implemented in our gplsim package.

**Remark.** In Step 2 of the profile-likelihood algorithm implementing
[@yu_penalised_2017] as well as the simultaneous non-linear least square
minimization methods implementing [@yu_penalized_2002], the spline knots
used for the basis functions depend on $\boldsymbol{\theta}$ because
they are sample quantiles or equally-spaced placed on the single index
$\{\boldsymbol{x}^{T}_{i} \boldsymbol{\theta}, i=1,...,n\}.$ That is,
the spline coefficient ${\boldsymbol{\beta}}$, along with the spline
knots implicitly, depends on the single index coefficient
${\boldsymbol{\theta}}$. We refer to the original methodological papers
[@yu_penalized_2002], [@yu_penalised_2017], and references therein for
more details.

# The gplsim package

The R package gplsim consists of one core estimation function gplsim and
some supporting functions such as visualization of the estimated curve
for the unknown univariate function. The R package gplsim depends on the
R package mgcv [@wood_mgcv_2001] and package minpack.lm [@minpack2022].
Unit tests using testthat are in place to ensure continued robustness of
the package.

## Main fitting function

The main estimation function gplsim implements the profile likelihood
algorithm of [@yu_penalised_2017] as well as the non-linear least square
method of [@yu_penalized_2002] described in the previous section. The
default method is the profile likelihood for responses from a general
exponential family and non-linear least square method for others.

The usage and input arguments of the main fitting function gplsim are
summarized as follows:

::: example
gplsim(Y, X, Z, family = gaussian, penalty = TRUE, profile = TRUE,
user.init = NULL, bs= \"ps\", \...)
:::

This function takes three required arguments: the response variable $Y$
in vector format, the single-index nonlinear predictors $X$ in the
matrix or vector format, and the linear predictors $Z$ in the matrix or
vector format. Please note that all the input covariates are required to
be numeric variables.

This function also takes several optional arguments for finer controls.
The optional argument family is a family object for models from the
built-in R package stats. This object is a list of functions and
expressions for defining link and variance functions. Supported link
functions include identity; logit, probit, cloglog; log; and inverse for
the family distributions of Gaussian, Binomial, Poisson, and Gamma,
respectively. Other families supported by glm and mgcv::gam are also
supported. The optional argument penalty is a logical variable to
specify whether to use penalized splines or un-penalized splines to fit
the model. The default value is TRUE to implement penalized splines. The
optional argument profile is a logical variable that indicates whether
the algorithm with profile likelihood or the algorithm with NLS
procedure is used. The default algorithm is set to the profile
likelihood algorithm. The optional argument user.init is a numeric
vector of the same length as the dimensionality of single-index
predictors. The users can use this argument to pass in any appropriate
user-defined initial single-index coefficients based on prior
information or domain knowledge. The default value is NULL, which
instructs the function to estimate initial single-index coefficients by
a generalized linear model.

As we utilize mgcv::gam and mgcv::s as the underlying algorithms for the
estimation of the unknown univariate function of the single index, there
are several arguments that can be passed into mgcv::gam and mgcv::s for
finer control. For example, the optional argument bs is a character
variable that specifies the spline basis in the estimation of the single
index function, and it will be passed into mgcv::s. The default has been
set to "ps" (P-splines with B-spline basis) while other choices are "tr"
(truncated power basis), "tp" (thin plate regression splines), and
others (see the help page of mgcv::smooth.terms). Other mgcv::gam
arguments can be passed to mgcv::s in \... includes the optional numeric
arguments k, which is the dimension of the basis of the smooth terms and
the arguments m, which is the order of the penalty for the smooth terms.
Additionally, users can also pass arguments scale into gam in \.... It
is a numeric indicator with a default value set to -1. Any negative
value including -1 indicates that the scale of response distribution is
unknown and thus needs to be estimated. Another option is 0, indicating
a scale of 1 for Poisson and binomial distribution and unknown for
others. Any positive value will be taken as the known scale parameter.
The optional argument smoothing_selection is a character variable that
specifies the criterion used in the selection of the smoothing parameter
$\lambda$. This argument corresponds to the argument method in
mgcv::gam, but it is renamed in this package to avoid confusion. The
supported criteria include "GCV.Cp","GACV.Cp", "ML","P-ML", "P-REML" and
"REML", while the default criterion is "GCV.Cp". For more details
regarding arguments in mgcv::gam and mgcv::s, users may refer to the
help page of mgcv::gam and mgcv::s.

The function gplsim returns an object class of gplsim, which extends the
gam object and glm object.

## Other functions

::: example
plot_si(gplsim.object,reference = NULL)
:::

This function plots the estimated curve for the unknown univariate
function $\phi$ from a gplsim-fitted model object. If the reference
object is provided, this function will add a reference line accordingly.

::: example
summary.gplsim(gplsim.object) print.summary.gplsim(gplsim.object)
:::

The functions summary.gplsim and print.summary.gplsim provide detailed
information related to the fitted model and summarize the results as
illustrated in the next section. These two functions can be called
directly by applying functions print and summary to gplsim.object.

::: example
simulation_data \<- generate_data(n,true.beta=c(1, 1,
1)/sqrt(3),family=\"gaussian\")
:::

The function generate_data generates data from a sine-bump model with
user-defined single index coefficients $\boldsymbol{\theta}$ via the
argument true.beta. If single-index coefficients $\boldsymbol{\theta}$
are not provided, this function will generate data against the default
coefficients $\boldsymbol{\theta} = (1,1,1) / \sqrt{3}$. The default
response is Gaussian distributed, while Binomial, Poisson, and Gamma
distributions are also supported.

# Real data and simulation examples

In this section, we demonstrate the use of the R package gplsim via a
real data analysis and a sine-bump simulation study.

## Air Pollution Data

We consider an environmental study on how meteorological variables $X$
affect the concentration of the air pollutant ozone $y$. Meteorological
variables $X$ contain wind speed, temperature, and radiation with
$n=111$ daily measurements. As the response variable $y$ is a continuous
variable, we adopt an identity link for Gaussian distribution. Note that
we use the same sequence of predictor variables to keep the results
directly comparable to [@yu_penalized_2002].

::: Sinput
library(gplsim) data(air) y=air$ozone                    # response
  X=as.matrix(air[,c(3,4,2)])    # single-index term
  colnames(X)=colnames(air[,c(3,4,2)])
  Z=NULL
  \end{Sinput}
\egroup 

We allow all three predictor variables, temperature, wind speed, and radiation, to enter the single-index term to capture the non-linear dependency as in \cite{yu_penalized_2002}. This model collapses to the single-index model as there is no partially linear term in the model.

\bgroup

  \egroup 

  The estimated normalized single-index coefficients with the profile likelihood algorithm are comparable to the results in \cite{yu_penalized_2002}. 
  As shown in the figure below, the estimated unknown function is quite monotonic and exhibits clear curvature. The estimated coefficient is positive for temperature, negative for wind speed, and positive for radiation but in a smaller magnitude per the reported summary. 

\bgroup 
  \begin{Sinput}
  plot_si(air.fit,yscale=c(1,6),plot_data = TRUE)

  \end{figure}
\egroup 

The above figure shows the single-index curve estimate of the air pollution data. The presence of curvature with multiple turning points is observed. This non-linear dependency is unlikely to be captured by a linear model. The single index that contains information from temperature, wind speed, and radiation contributes to the ozone concentration differently in different segments. 

We also implemented the simultaneous non-linear least square minimization algorithm described in \cite{yu_penalized_2002}, where the original code was written in Matlab.

Note that here outputs are directly from mgcv package for GAM model summary. The p-value and confidence intervals here do not take into account the uncertainty in the estimation of the single-index coefficients. If required, valid inference using bootstrap or asymptotic results from \cite{yu_penalized_2002} and \cite{yu_penalised_2017} is available.


\subsection{Simulations}

We present a popular sine-bump simulation study that adopts the design as in \citep{carroll_generalized_1997, yu_penalised_2017, yu_penalized_2002}. The package can accommodate responses from a general exponential family, where the conditional mean is generated from the following model
\begin{equation*}
  g^{-1}\{\sin \left\{\pi\left(\mathbf{x}^{T} \boldsymbol{\theta}-c_{1}\right) /\left(c_{2}-c_{1}\right)\right\}+z \gamma\},
\end{equation*}
where$g{}$is a link function$; = (1,1,1) /
$with each predictor$x$from independent uniform in$\[0,1\]$;$$;$z$is a binary predictor with$`<!-- -->`{=html}1$for even observations and$`<!-- -->`{=html}0$otherwise;$c_1=
/2-1.645/$and$c_2= /2+1.645/$are two constants. 

For demonstration, we first show simulation codes and outputs on one random replication. We use the supporting function \texorpdfstring%
{{\normalfont\ttfamily\hyphenchar\font=-1 generate\_data}}%
{generate\_data} to generate simulation data.
\bgroup 
  \begin{Sinput}

  # This function generates a sine-bump simulation data 
  data <- generate_data(n,true.theta=true.theta,family="gaussian",ncopy=M) 
  y=(data$Y)\[\[1\]\] \# Gaussian error with standard deviation 0.1

We use default settings of the main estimation function gplsim on the

From the above summary results of the fitted model, we see that the
estimated single-index coefficients $\widehat{\boldsymbol{\theta}}$ and
partial-linear coefficients $\widehat{\gamma}$ are quite close to the
true parameters.

We also plot the average estimated curve for the unknown univariate
function over 200 replications. The dashed lines are the corresponding
2.5 and 97.5 quantiles bound. We observe that the average curve estimate
virtually overlays the true curve.

mean, standard error (se) and bias for each parameter estimate with
sample size $n=1000$ over $M=200$ replications. We use canonical link
functions, that is, identity link for Gaussian family, logit link for
Binomial family, and log link for Poisson family. One can see that the
algorithm for our R package gplsim is effective in estimation of various
GPLSIMs.

# Summary

In this paper, we have presented an R package gplsim that implements
generalized partial linear single-index models described in
[@yu_penalised_2017] and [@yu_penalized_2002]. The functions and
algorithms used in the package are able to accurately estimate the
single-index coefficients, partial-linear coefficients, as well as the
unknown univariate function with expedient computation. We believe this
package will be useful to practitioners in diverse fields such as
finance, econometrics, and medicine, where a flexible and interpretable
models are desirable.

    package maintainer's public GitHub repository
    [github.com/zzz1990771/gplsim](github.com/zzz1990771/gplsim){.uri}.
