title: Update of the nlme Package to Allow a Fixed Standard Deviation of the Residual
  Error
abstract: The use of linear and non-linear mixed models in the life sciences and pharmacometrics
  is common practice. Estimation of the parameters of models not involving a system
  of differential equations is often done by the R or S-Plus software with the nonlinear
  mixed effects nlme package. The estimated residual error may be used for diagnosis
  of the fitted model, but not whether the model correctly describes the relation
  between response and included variables including the true covariance structure.
  The latter is only true if the residual error is known in advance. Therefore, it
  may be necessary or more appropriate to fix the residual error a priori instead
  of estimate its value. This can be the case if one wants to include evidence from
  past studies or a theoretical derivation; e.g., when using a binomial model. S-Plus
  has an option to fix this residual error to a constant, in contrast to R. For convenience,
  the nlme package was customized to offer this option as well. In this paper, we
  derived the log-likelihoods for the mixed models using a fixed residual error. By
  using some well-known examples from mixed models, we demonstrated the equivalence
  of R and S-Plus with respect to the estimates. The updated package has been accepted
  by the Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN) team and will be available at the
  CRAN website.
