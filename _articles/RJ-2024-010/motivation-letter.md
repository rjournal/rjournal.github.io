Dear Dr. Hurley and R Journal Editorial Team,
\bigskip

On behalf of myself and Dr. Christopher T. Franck, We would like to submit the accompanying manuscript “Bayesian Model Selection with Latent Group-Based Effects and Variances with the R Package slgf” for consideration in the R journal. This manuscript describes the slgf R package, which has been recently accepted on CRAN. The slgf package enables the user to easily assess suspected latent grouping factors in linear models. We have shown these latent grouping effects to be plausible for numerous fields including bioinformatics, agriculture, industry, engineering, and medicine. Our approach allows the researcher to to detect group-based regression effects, latent interactions, and/or heteroscedastic error variance through Bayesian model selection, and is based on two recent methodological papers in Technometrics.  

We believe this work is suitable for the R journal. This work substantially expands upon our previous R package hiddenf, which was previously described in the R journal article “Exploring Interaction Effects in Two-Factor Studies using the hidden Package in R.” The older hiddenf package conducted classical hypothesis testing for a small number of non-additve forms and was restricted solely to the two-way unreplicated layout. By contrast, the slgf package extends the notion of latent grouping factors to the much broader class of linear models, enabling the user to specify which factor potentially has latent clustering, and accommodating other non-clustered regression effects in the form specified by the user. This greatly expands the class of problems that can be addressed compared with our earlier work. We illustrate usage of the package with four applied data sets.  

If we may provide any further information, please contact me at metzger.181@osu.edu.

NOTES: we believe all remaining errors from the submission checking process are not critical.  

1) The title case error does not seem appropriate, as the package name should be lowercase.  

2) The sentence case error regarding the section "SLGF" does not take into account that we have used this as an abbreviation in the paper.  

3) I am frankly unsure of why the missing introduction error is being produced. Section 1 is titled "Introduction" and clearly lays out the motivation, goals, and novelty of the work. I am happy to make a necessary correction if I have overlooked a style convention.   

4) The spelling errors appear to be false positives.
