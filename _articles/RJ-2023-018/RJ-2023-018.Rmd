title: 'pCODE: Estimating Parameters of ODE Models'
abstract: ' The ordinary differential equation (ODE) models are prominent to characterize
  the mechanism of dynamical systems with various applications in biology, engineering,
  and many other areas. While the form of ODE models is often proposed based on the
  understanding or assumption of the dynamical systems, the values of ODE model parameters
  are often unknown. Hence, it is of great interest to estimate the ODE parameters
  once the observations of dynamic systems become available. The parameter cascade
  method initially proposed by [@parcascade] is shown to provide an accurate estimation
  of ODE parameters from the noisy observations at a low computational cost. This
  method is further promoted with the implementation in the R package CollocInfer
  by [@CollocInfer]. However, one bottleneck in using CollocInfer to implement the
  parameter cascade method is the tedious derivations and coding of the Jacobian and
  Hessian matrices required by the objective functions for doing estimation. We develop
  an R package pCODE to implement the parameter cascade method, which has the advantage
  that the users are not required to provide any Jacobian or Hessian matrices. Functions
  in the pCODE package accommodate users for estimating ODE parameters along with
  their variances and tuning the smoothing parameters. The package is demonstrated
  and assessed with four simulation examples with various settings. We show that pCODE
  offers a derivative-free procedure to estimate any ODE models where its functions
  are easy to understand and apply. Furthermore, the package has an online Shiny app
  at <https://pcode.shinyapps.io/pcode/>. '
