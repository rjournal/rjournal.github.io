title: 'OrthoPanels: An R Package for Estimating a Dynamic Panel Model with Fixed
  Effects Using the Orthogonal Reparameterization Approach'
abstract: 'This article describes the R package OrthoPanels, which includes the function
  opm(). This function implements the orthogonal reparameterization approach recommended
  by Lancaster (2002) to estimate dynamic panel models with fixed effects (and optionally:
  wave specific intercepts). This article provides a statistical description of the
  orthogonal reparameterization approach, a demonstration of the package using real-world
  data, and simulations comparing the estimator to the known-to-be-biased OLS estimator
  and the commonly used GMM estimator.'
