title: 'RStorm: Developing and Testing Streaming Algorithms in R'
abstract: Streaming data, consisting of indefinitely evolving sequences, are becoming
  ubiquitous in many branches of science and in various applications. Computer scientists
  have developed streaming applications such as Storm and the S4 distributed stream
  computing platform[^1] to deal with data streams. However, in current production
  packages testing and evaluating streaming algorithms is cumbersome. This paper presents
  *RStorm* for the development and evaluation of streaming algorithms analogous to
  these production packages, but implemented fully in R. *RStorm* allows developers
  of streaming algorithms to quickly test, iterate, and evaluate various implementations
  of streaming algorithms. The paper provides both a canonical computer science example,
  the streaming word count, and examples of several statistical applications of *RStorm*.

# Introduction

Streaming data, consisting of indefinitely and possibly time-evolving
sequences, are becoming ubiquitous in many branches of science
[@Chu2007; @Michalak2012]. The omnipresence of streaming data poses new
challenges for statistics and machine learning. To enable user friendly
development and evaluation of algorithms dealing with data streams this
paper introduces [*RStorm*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=RStorm).

Streaming learning algorithms can informally be described as algorithms
which never "look back" to earlier data arriving at $t < t'$. Streaming
algorithms provide a computationally efficient way to deal with
continuous data streams by summarizing all historic data into a limited
set of parameters. With the current growth of available data the
development of reliable streaming algorithms whose behavior is well
understood is highly important [@Michalak2012]. For a more formal
description of streaming (or online) learning see @bottou-98x. Streaming
analysis however provides both numerical as well as estimation
challenges. Already for simple estimators, such as sample means and
variances, multiple streaming algorithms can be deployed. For more
complex statistical models, closed forms to exactly minimize popular
cost functions in a stream are often unavailable.

Computer scientists recently developed a series of software packages for
the streaming processing of data in production environments. Frameworks
such as S4 by Yahoo! [@S4], and Twitter's Storm [@Storm] provide an
infrastructure for *real-time* streaming computation of event-driven
data [e.g., @Babcock2002; @Anagnostopoulos2012] which is scalable and
reliable.

Recently, efforts have been made to facilitate easy testing and
development of streaming processes within R for example with the
[*stream*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=stream). *stream* allows
users of R to setup (or simulate) a data stream and specify data stream
tasks to analyze the stream [@StreamPackage]. While *stream* allows for
the development and testing of streaming analysis in R, it does not have
a strong link to current production environments in which streams can be
utilized. Implementations of data streams in R analogous to production
environments such as Twitter's Storm are currently lacking. *RStorm*
models the topology structure introduced by Storm[^2], to enable
development, testing, and graphical representation of streaming
algorithms. *RStorm* is intended as a research and development package
for those wishing to implement the analysis of data streams in
frameworks outside of R, but who want to utilize R's extensive plotting
and data generating abilities to test their implementations. By
providing an implementation of a data stream that is extremely
comparable to the production code used in Storm, algorithms tested in R
can easily be implemented in production environments.

# Package *RStorm*: Counting words

In this section *RStorm* is introduced using the canonical streaming
example used often for the introduction of Storm: a streaming word
count. For *RStorm* the basic terminology and concepts from Storm[^3]
are adapted, which are briefly explained before discussing the
implementation of a streaming word count in *RStorm*. The aim of the
streaming word count algorithm is to, given a stream of sentences --
such as posts to a web service like Twitter -- count the frequency of
occurrence of each word. In Storm, a data stream consists of a *spout*
-- the data source -- from which *tuples* are passed along a *topology*.
The topology is a description of the spout and a series of *bolts*,
which themselves are functional blocks of code. A bolt performs
operations on *tuples*, the data objects that are passed between bolts
in the stream. Bolts can store the results of their operations in a
*local hashmap* (or database) and *emit* results (again tuples) to other
bolts further down the topology. The topology, the bolts, the spout, the
tuples, and the hashmap(s) together compose the most important concepts
to understand a stream implemented in *RStorm*.

The *topology* is a description of the whole streaming process, and a
solution to the word-count problem is given by the simple topology that
is graphically presented in Figure [1](#Fig:WordCountTopology). This
topology describes that sentences (*tuples*) are emitted by the *spout*.
These tuples -- containing a full sentence -- are analyzed by the first
processing bolt. This first bolt, `SplitSentence(tuple)`, splits a
sentence up into individual words and emits these single words as
tuples. Next, these individual words are counted by the
`CountWords(tuple)` bolt. The topology depicted in
Figure [1](#Fig:WordCountTopology) contains the core elements needed to
understand the functioning of *RStorm* for a general streaming process.
A topology consists of a description of the ordering of spouts and bolts
in a stream. Tuples are the main data format to pass information between
bolts. A call to `Emit(tuple, ...)` within a bolt will make the emitted
tuple available for other bolts. Table [1](#Table:1) summarizes the most
important functions of the *RStorm* package to facilitate a stream and
briefly explains their functionality.

  **Function**                     **Description**
  -------------------------------- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  `Bolt(FUNC, listen = 0, ...)`    Used to create a new bolt. A bolt consists of an R function, and a specification of the bolt / spouts from which it receives tuples. The `listen` argument is used to indicate the order of bolts.

  `Emit(x, ...)`                   Used to emit tuples from inside a bolt.

  `RStorm(topology, ...)`          Used to run a stream once a full topology has been specified.

  `GetHash(name, ...)`             Used to retrieve, inside a bolt, values from a hashmap.

  `SetHash(name, data)`            Used to store, inside a bolt, values in a hashmap.

  `Topology(spout, ...)`           Used to create a topology by specifying the datasource (a `data.frame`) as the first spout.

  `AddBolt(topology, bolt, ...)`   Used to add a bolt to a stream. Once a bolt is added it receives an ID, which can be used in subsequent specification of bolts (`listen=ID`) to determine the order of the stream.

  `Tuple(x, ...)`                  A single row `data.frame`. Used as the primary data format to be passed along the stream.

## Word count in *RStorm* and Java & Python {#wrd:count:storm}

In *RStorm* the emulation of a streaming word count can be setup as
follows: First, one loads *RStorm* and opens a datafile containing
multiple sentences:

``` r
library(RStorm)  # Include package RStorm
data(sentences)
```

The data, which is a `data.frame`, will function as the spout by
emitting data from it row-by-row. After defining the spout, the
functional bolts need to be specified. Table  [2](#table:bolt1) presents
both the *RStorm* as well as the Storm implementation of the first
processing bolt. The Storm implementation is done partly in Java and
partly in Python. For the *RStorm* implementation the full functional
code is provided, while for the Storm implementation a number of details
are omitted. However, it is easy to see how an actual Storm
implementation maps to implementations in *RStorm*.

  {
    # Split the sentence into words
    words <- unlist(
      strsplit(as.character(
        tuple$sentence), " "
      ))
  
    # For each word emit a tuple
    for (word in words)
      Emit(Tuple(
        data.frame(word = word)), 
        ...)
  }
```

``` r
  /**

  public SplitSentence()

      words = 
        tuple.values[0].split(" ")
      for word in words:
        storm.emit([word])
```

In both cases the `SplitSentence()` function receives tuples, each of
which contains a sentence. Each sentence is split into words which are
emitted further down the stream using the `Emit()` (or `storm.emit()`)
function[^4]. The second bolt is the `CountWords()` bolt, for which the
*RStorm* code and the analogous Java code are presented in
Table [3](#table:bolt2).

  # R word counting function:

    # Get the hashmap "word count"
    words <- GetHash("wordcount")  
    if (tuple$word %in% words$word) {  
      # Increment the word count:
      words[words$word == tuple$word,]
        $count <- 
        words[words$word == tuple$word,]
          $count + 1
    } else { # If the word does not exist
      # Add the word with count 1
      words <- rbind(words, data.frame(
        word = tuple$word, count = 1))
    }  
  
    # Store the hashmap
    SetHash("wordcount", words)
  }
```

**Java**

``` r
  /**
  * A Java function which stores
  * the word count. */
  public void
    execute(Tuple tuple, ...)
  {
    /* collect word from the tuple */
    String word = tuple.getString(0);
    
    /* get counts from hashmap */
    Integer count = counts.get(word);
    if (count == null) count = 0;
     
    /* increment counts */
    count++;
     
    /* store counts */
    counts.put(word, count);
  }
```

The `CountWords()` bolt receives tuples containing individual words. The
*RStorm* implementation first uses the `GetHash()` function to get the
entries of a hashmap / local-store called `"wordcount"`. In production
systems this often is a hashmap, or, if need be, some kind of database
system. In *RStorm* this functionality is implemented using `GetHash`
and `SetHash` as methods to easily store and retrieve objects. If the
hashmap exists, the function subsequently checks whether the word is
already in the hashmap. If the word is not found, the new word is added
to the hashmap with a count of $1$, otherwise the current count is
incremented by $1$.

: Table 4: Specification of the topology using *RStorm* and Java. Note:
The Java code is incomplete, but used only to illustrate the
similarities between the two implementations.
:::

After specifying the two bolts the *topology* needs to be specified. The
topology determines the processing order of the streaming process.
Table [4](#table:topology) presents how this is implemented in *RStorm*
and Java[^5]. Each time a bolt is added to a topology in *RStorm* the
user is alerted to the position of that bolt within in the stream, and
the `listen` argument can be used to specify which emitted tuples a bolt
should receive. Once the topology is fully specified, the stream can be
run using the following call:

``` r
# Run the stream:
result <- RStorm(topology)
# Obtain results stored in "wordcount"
counts <- GetHash("wordcount", result)
```

The function `GetHash()` is overloaded for when the stream has finished
and the function is used outside of a `Bolt`. It can be used to retrieve
a hashmap once the result of a streaming process is passed to it as a
second argument. The returned `counts` object is a `data.frame`
containing columns of words and their associated counts and can be used
to create a table of word counts.

The word count example shows the direct analogy between the
implementation of a data stream in *RStorm* and in Storm. However, by
focusing on an implementation that is analogous to the Storm
implementation, a number of desirable R specific properties are lost.
For example, the use of `for (word in words) {...}` in the word count
example defies the efficient vectorisation of R, and thus is relatively
slow. In R one would approach the word count problem (non streaming)
differently: e.g.,
`table(unlist(strsplit(as.character(sentences$sentence), " ")))`. The
latter is much faster since it uses R properly, but the implementation
in a data stream based on this code is not at all evident. Further note
that while *RStorm* is modeled specifically after Storm, many other
emergent streaming production packages -- such as Yahoo!'s S4 -- have a
comparable structure. In all cases, the machinery to setup the stream
can be separated from a number of functional pieces of code that update
a set of parameters. These functional blocks of code are implemented in
the *RStorm* bolts, and these can, after development in R, easily be
implemented in production environments.

# *RStorm* examples

The following section shows a number of streaming examples and
demonstrates some of *RStorm*'s additional features.

## Example $1$: Comparisons of streaming variance algorithms {#stream:var}

This first example compares two bolts for the streaming computation of a
sample variance. It introduces the `TrackRow(data)` functionality
implemented in *RStorm* which can be used to monitor the progress of
parameters at each time point in the stream. Table [5](#table:vars)
shows two bolts with competing implementations of streaming variance
algorithms. The first bolt uses the standard Sum of Squares algorithm,
while the second uses Welford's method [@Welford2012].

  --------------------------------------------------

  : Table 5: Comparison of two different bolts to compute a streaming
  variance.
:::

**Sum of Squares method**

``` r
var.SS <- function(x, ...) {
   # Get values stored in hashmap
   params <- GetHash("params1")  
   if (!is.data.frame(params)) {
     # If no hashmap exists initialise:
     params <- list()
     params$n <- params$sum <- 
       params$sum2 <- 0
   }
   
   # Perform updates:
   n <- params$n + 1  
   S <- params$sum + as.numeric(x[1])
   SS <- params$sum2 + 
     as.numeric(x[1]^2)
   
   # Store the hashmap: 
   SetHash("params1", 
     data.frame(n = n, sum = S, 
       sum2 = SS))
	
   # Track the variance at time t:
   var <- 1/(n * (n-1)) * (n * SS - S^2)
   TrackRow("var.SS", 
     data.frame(var = var))
 }
```

**Welford's method**

``` r
var.Welford <- function(x, ...) {
   x <- as.numeric(x[1])
   params <- GetHash("params2")
   if (!is.data.frame(params)) {
     params <- list()
     params$M <- params$S <- 
       params$n <- 0
   }
   n <- params$n + 1
   M <- params$M + 
     (x - params$M) / (n + 1)
   S <- params$S + 
     (x - params$M) * (x - M)

   SetHash("params2", 
     data.frame(n = n, M = M, S = S))

   var <- ifelse(n > 1, 
     S / (n - 1), 0)

   TrackRow("var.Welford", 
     data.frame(var = var))
 }
```

After specifying the functional bolts, the topology can be specified.
Creating a topology object starts with the specification of a
`data.frame`. This dataframe will be iterated through row-by-row to
emulate a steam.

``` r
t <- 1000
x <- rnorm(t, 10^8, 1)
topology <- Topology(data.frame(x = x))
```

The spout defined in the object `topology` now contains a dataframe with
a single column `x`, which contains $1000$ draws from a Gaussian
distribution with a large mean, $\mu = 10^8$, and a comparatively small
variance, $\sigma^2=1$. Subsequently, the bolts are added to the
topology:

``` r
topology <- AddBolt(topology, Bolt(var.SS, listen = 0))
topology <- AddBolt(topology, Bolt(var.Welford, listen = 0))
result <- RStorm(topology)
```

The `TrackRow()` function called within both functional bolts allows for
inspection of the two variances at each point in time: using
`TrackRow()` the values are stored for each time point. Using (e.g.,)
`GetTrack("var.SS", result)` on the `result` object after running the
topology allows for the creation of Figure [2](#fig:one).

![Figure 2: Comparison of two streaming variance algorithms. The sums of
squares method (black) is numerically unstable when
$\mu \gg \sigma^2$.](images/JSS_Paper_v2-fig-comp-plot.png){#fig:one
width="100%" alt="graphic without alt text"}

## Example $2$: Online gradient descent {#logit:stream}

![Figure 3: The DoNB SGD
topology.](images/Topology-SGD.png){#Fig:SGDTopology width="100%" alt="graphic without alt text"}

This example provides an implementation in *RStorm* of an logistic
regression using stochastic gradient descent [SGD; e.g.,
@Zinkevich2010], together with a Double or Nothing [DoNB; @Owen2012]
bootstrap to estimate the uncertainty of the parameters. The functional
bolt first performs the sampling needed for the DoNB bootstrap and
subsequently computes the update of the feature vector $\vec{w}_t$:

``` r
StochasticGradientDescent <- function(tuple, learn = .5, boltID, ...) {
  if (rbinom(1, 1, .5) == 1) { # Only add the observation half of the times
    # get the set up weights for this bolt
    weights <- GetHash(paste("Weights_", boltID, sep = "")) 
    if (!is.data.frame(weights)) { 
      weights <- data.frame(beta = c(-1, 2))
    } 
    w <- weights$beta  # get weights-vector w
    y <- as.double(tuple[1])  # get scalar y  
    X <- as.double(tuple[2:3])  # get feature-vector X  
    grad <- (1 / ( 1 + exp(-t(w) %*% X)) - as.double(tuple[1])) * X
    SetHash(paste("Weights_", boltID, sep = ""),
            data.frame(beta = w - learn * grad))  # save weights
  } # otherwise ignore
}
```

The dataset for this example contains $1000$ dichotomous outcomes using
only a single predictor:

``` r
n <- 1000
X <- matrix(c(rep(1, n), rnorm(n, 0, 1)), ncol = 2)
beta <- c(1, 2)
y <- rbinom(n, 1, plogis(X %*% beta))
```

The DoNB is implemented by specifying *within* the functional bolt
whether or not a datapoint in the stream should contribute to the update
of the weights. Using the `boltID` parameter the same functional bolt
can be used multiple times in the stream, each with its own local store.
The topology is specified as follows:

``` r
topology <- Topology(data.frame(data), .verbose = FALSE)
for (i in 1:100) {
  topology <- AddBolt(topology, Bolt(StochasticGradientDescent,
                      listen = 0, boltID = i), .verbose = FALSE)
}
```

This topology is represented graphically in
Figure [3](#Fig:SGDTopology). After running the topology, the
`GetHashList()` function can be used to retrieve all of the objects
saved using `SetHash()` at once. This object is a list containing all
the dataframes that are stored during the stream. It can be used derive
the estimates of $\beta$ and the $95\%$ confidence interval:
$\beta_0 = 1.33$ $[.50, 2.08]$ and $\beta_1 = 2.02$ $[1.34, 2.76]$ which
are close to the estimates obtained using `glm`:
$\vec{\beta}=\{1.25,2.04 \}$.

## Example $3$: The $k$-arm bandit {#examp:bandit}

The last example presents a situation in which streaming data naturally
arises: bandit problems [e.g., @Whittle1980]. In the canonical bandit
problem, the *two-armed Bernoulli bandit* problem, the data stream
consists of rewards $r_1, \dots, r_t$ which are observed after playing
arm $a \in \{1,2\}$ at time $t'$. The goal is to find a policy to decide
between the two arms at $t=t'$ such that the cumulative reward
$\mathcal{R} = \sum_{i=1}^{t} r_i$ is as large as possible.

*RStorm* can be used to compare competing solutions to the $k$-armed
Bernoulli bandit problem. The data is composed of the reward $r$ at time
$t$ for each of the actions $a_1, \dots a_k$. The function below creates
such a dataframe for usage in multiple simulation runs of different
policies:

``` r
createCounterFactuals <- function(k = 2, t = 100, p.max = .5, epsilon = .1) {
  p <- c(p.max, rep(p.max - epsilon, k - 1))
  obs <- data.frame(matrix(rbinom(t * k, 1, p), ncol = k, byrow = TRUE))
}
```

This function creates a dataframe with $k$ arms, where arm $1$ has an
expected payoff of `p.max`, and the other $k-1$ arms have an expected
payoff of `p.max-epsilon`. Here we compare playing the best action
(optimal play -- typically unknown) to a policy called Thompson sampling
[@THOMPSON1933; @Scott2010]. Each datapoint $z_t$ emitted by the spout
is a vector with the possible outcome of playing arm $1, \dots, k$ at
time $t$.

For optimal play, the first bolt emits the reward observed by playing
arm $1$, and the second bolt uses a hashmap to compute the cumulative
reward $\mathcal{R}_{max}$. The implementation of Thompson sampling, or
Randomized Probability Matching [RPM, see @Scott2010] uses three bolts:
the first bolt (`selectRPM`) determines which arm to play given a set of
estimates of the success for each arm and emits the observed reward. The
second bolt (`updateRPM`) updates the estimated success of the arm that
was played (using a simple beta-Bernoulli model), and the last bolt
(`countRPM`) computes the cumulative reward $\mathcal{R}_{rpm}$. Both of
the implementations are presented in Table [6](#table:thomp).

The topology is graphically presented in
Figure [4](#Fig:BanditTopology). The topology is initially specified
using an empty dataset to enable the setup of multiple simulations:

``` r
topology <- Topology(data.frame())
topology <- AddBolt(topology, Bolt(selectMax, listen = 0))
topology <- AddBolt(topology, Bolt(countMax, listen = 1))
topology <- AddBolt(topology, Bolt(selectRPM, listen = 0))
topology <- AddBolt(topology, Bolt(updateRPM, listen = 3))
topology <- AddBolt(topology, Bolt(countRPM, listen = 3))
```

After specifying the bolts, the `ChangeSpout()` function is used to run
the same topology with a different datasource. At each simulation run
the spout is changed, and the regret,
$\mathcal{R}_{max} - \mathcal{R}_{rpm}$, stored:

``` r
sims <- 100
regret <- rep(NA, sims)
for (i in 1:sims) {
  obs <- createCounterFactuals(k = 5, t = 10000, p.max = .5)
  topology <- ChangeSpout(topology, obs)
  result <- RStorm(topology)
  regret[i] <- GetHash("maxSum", result)$sum - GetHash("rpmSum", result)$sum
}
```

After running $100$ simulation runs with `p.max = .5` for $T=10.000$ the
average regret of Thompson sampling is $74.3$, with an empirical $95\%$
confidence interval of $\left[ 43.9 , 104.5 \right]$.

# Conclusions and limitations

Datasets in all areas of science are growing increasingly large, and
they are often collected continuously. There is a need for novel
analysis methods which synchronize current methodological advances with
the emerging opportunities of streaming data. Streaming algorithms
provide opportunities to deal with extremely large and ever growing data
sets in (near) real time. However, the development of streaming
algorithms for complex models is often cumbersome: the software packages
that facilitate streaming processing in production environments do not
provide statisticians with the simulation, estimation, and plotting
tools they are used to. *RStorm* implements a streaming architecture
modeled on Storm for easy development and testing of streaming
algorithms in R.

In the future we intend to further develop the *RStorm* package to
include a) default implementations of often occurring bolts (such as
streaming means and variances of variables), and b) the ability to use,
one-to-one, the bolts developed in *RStorm* in Storm. Storm provides the
ability to write bolts in languages other than Java (for example Python,
as demonstrated in the word count example). We hope to further develop
*RStorm* such that true data streams in Storm can use functional bolts
developed in R. *RStorm* is not designed as a scalable tool for
production processing of data streams, and we do not believe that this
is R's core strength. However, by providing the ability to test and
develop functional bolts in R, and use these bolts directly in
production streaming processing applications, *RStorm* aims to support
users of R to quickly implement scalable and fault tolerant streaming
applications.
