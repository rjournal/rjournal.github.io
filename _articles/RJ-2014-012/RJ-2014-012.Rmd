title: 'RStorm: Developing and Testing Streaming Algorithms in R'
abstract: Streaming data, consisting of indefinitely evolving sequences, are becoming
  ubiquitous in many branches of science and in various applications. Computer scientists
  have developed streaming applications such as Storm and the S4 distributed stream
  computing platform1 to deal with data streams. However, in current production packages
  testing and evaluating streaming algorithms is cumbersome. This paper presents RStorm
  for the development and evaluation of streaming algorithms analogous to these production
  packages, but implemented fully in R. RStorm allows developers of streaming algorithms
  to quickly test, iterate, and evaluate various implementations of streaming algorithms.
  The paper provides both a canonical computer science example, the streaming word
  count, and examples of several statistical applications of RStorm.
