title: 'The Concordance Test, an Alternative to Kruskal-Wallis Based on the Kendall-$\tau$
  Distance: An R Package'
abstract: The Kendall rank correlation coefficient, based on the Kendall-$\tau$ distance,
  is used to measure the ordinal association between two measurements. In this paper,
  we introduce a new coefficient also based on the Kendall-$\tau$ distance, the Concordance
  coefficient, and a test to measure whether different samples come from the same
  distribution. This work also presents a new R package, ConcordanceTest, with the
  implementation of the proposed coefficient. We illustrate the use of the Concordance
  coefficient to measure the ordinal association between quantity and quality measures
  when two or more samples are considered. In this sense, the Concordance coefficient
  can be seen as a generalization of the Kendall rank correlation coefficient and
  an alternative to the non-parametric mean rank-based methods for comparing two or
  more samples. A comparison of the proposed Concordance coefficient and the classical
  Kruskal-Wallis statistic is presented through a comparison of the exact distributions
  of both statistics.
