title: 'The Concordance Test, an Alternative to Kruskal-Wallis Based on the Kendall-$\tau$
  Distance: An R Package'
abstract: The Kendall rank correlation coefficient, based on the Kendall-$\tau$ distance,
  is used to measure the ordinal association between two measurements. In this paper,
  we introduce a new coefficient also based on the Kendall-$\tau$ distance, the Concordance
  coefficient, and a test to measure whether different samples come from the same
  distribution. This work also presents a new R package, ConcordanceTest, with the
  implementation of the proposed coefficient. We illustrate the use of the Concordance
  coefficient to measure the ordinal association between quantity and quality measures
  when two or more samples are considered. In this sense, the Concordance coefficient
  can be seen as a generalization of the Kendall rank correlation coefficient and
  an alternative to the non-parametric mean rank-based methods for comparing two or
  more samples. A comparison of the proposed Concordance coefficient and the classical
  Kruskal-Wallis statistic is presented through a comparison of the exact distributions
  of both statistics.

# Introduction {#sec:intro}

When we have a sample of observations of a given population it may be
difficult to assume that they come from a certain distribution since we
may not always have any type of information about the variable under
study and when we do, it may not be enough to determine the type of
distribution. In these cases, parametric inference is inappropriate.
Moreover, this type of technique may be unsuitable should the
observations not fulfill any of the basic assumptions on which they are
based; normality and a large quantity of data.

Violation of the necessary assumptions in parametric statistics
necessitates the use of non-parametric statistics. Non-parametric tests
do not depend on the definition of a distribution function or
statistical parameters such as mean, variance, etc. The use of
non-parametric tests, despite being less powerful, is also adequate when
there are not enough observations available, when data are non-normal
data or when ordinal data are being analyzed.

Although the first steps in non-parametric statistics began earlier, it
was not until the 1930s that a systematic study in this field appeared.
[@Fisher1935] introduced the permutation test or randomization test as a
simple way to compute the sampling distribution for any test statistic
under the null hypothesis that does not establish any effect on all
possible outcomes. Over the next two decades some of the main
non-parametric tests emerged,
[@Friedman1940; @Kendall1939; @Kendall1938; @Kruskal1958; @Kruskal1952; @Wilcoxon1947; @Pitman1937; @Wilcoxon1945],
among others.

The main advantages of the non-parametric tests are: the data can be
nonnumerical observations while they can be classified according to some
criterion, they are usually easy to calculate and do not make any
hypothesis about the distribution of the population from which the
samples are taken. We can also cite two drawbacks: the non-parametric
tests are less precise than other statistical models and they are based
on the order of the elements in the sample and this order will likely
stay the same even if the numerical data change.

There are many non-parametric tests in the literature, which can
basically be classified into four categories depending on whether: it is
a test to compare two or more than two related samples or a test for
comparing related or unrelated samples. Examples of the most used
non-parametric tests in the literature for each of these four situations
are the following: the *Wilcoxon signed-rank test* [@Wilcoxon1945] for
comparing two related samples, the *Mann-Whitney (Wilcoxon) test*
[@Wilcoxon1947] for comparing two unrelated samples, the *Friedman test*
[@Friedman1940] for comparing three or more related samples, and the
*Kruskal-Wallis test* [@Kruskal1952] for comparing three or more
unrelated samples. Several methods that exploit some characteristic of
the samples have appeared in the literature in recent years, such as
[@Alhakim2008; @Terpstra2003].

It is also possible to measure the degree of association of two
variables through a non-parametric approach, in that sense we can
mention the Kendall rank correlation coefficient [@Kendall1938] and the
Spearman rank correlation coefficient [@Spearman1904].

In [@Aparicio2020], the authors introduce the *Kendall-$\tau$ partition
ranking*; given a ranking of elements of a set and given a disjoint
partition of the same set, the Kendall-$\tau$ partition ranking is the
induced linear order of the subsets of the partition which follows from
the given ranking of elements of a set. In this work, we propose to use
the Kendall-$\tau$ distance as a concordance measure between the
different samples in an ordered set of observations. In this regard, the
proposed measure, which we call *Concordance coefficient*, can be
considered as an extension of the Kendall rank correlation coefficient
when more than two samples are considered. The main difference between
the proposed measure and the previous ones, is the consideration of the
Kendall-$\tau$ distance instead of ranks, which use classical methods.
We also propose a significance test in order to determine when more than
two samples come from the same distribution, and present a comparison
with the classical Kruskal-Wallis method. We illustrate the use of the
proposed coefficient with a new R package,
[ConcordanceTest](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=ConcordanceTest)
[@ConcordanceTest2022], which is freely available from the Comprehensive
R Archive Network (CRAN). Actually, R establishes the state of the art
in statistical software. There are currently packages for all the
non-parametric tests mentioned above, for example: the
[Kendall](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=Kendall) package
[@KendallPackage2011], which deals with the Kendall rank correlation
coefficient; the
[pspearman](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=pspearman) package
[@pspearmanPackage2014], with the Spearman rank correlation coefficient;
or the stats package: an R Core Team and contributors' worldwide package
that contains many of the non-parametric tests for comparing two or
more, related or unrelated, samples. The Kendall-$\tau$ distance, on
which the proposed coefficient is based, is one of the most used in
distance-based models, for which there are also recent alternatives in
R. See, for example, the
[PerMallows](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=PerMallows)
[@Irurozki2016], [rankdist](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=rankdist)
[@Qian2019] or
[BayesMallows](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=BayesMallows) packages
[@Sorensen2020].

The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. After a brief
review in the next section of the main features of the Kendall rank
correlation coefficient and the Kruskal-Wallis statistic, in the
following two sections we present the coefficient we propose in this
work and illustrate its use with our ConcordanceTest package.
Specifically, in the third section we introduce the Concordance
coefficient while in the fourth section the related statistical test is
presented. The fifth section includes a comparison between the
Kruskal-Wallis test in the stats package and that presented in this
work. Some final remarks follow in the last section. Appendix A presents
an example of the probability distribution of the Concordance
coefficient and the Kruskal-Wallis statistic. Appendix B deals with a
comparison between the probability density function of the Concordance
coefficient and the Kruskal-Wallis statistic for several experiments.
Finally, Appendix C presents some details of how the p-values for the
Concordance coefficient have been calculated and shows some critical
values and exact p-values.

# Non-parametric tests {#sec:nonparametric}

This section presents the Kendall rank correlation coefficient
[@Kendall1938], a coefficient to measure the relationship between two
samples ordinally, and the Kruskal-Wallis statistical test
[@Kruskal1952], which is a rank-based statistical test to measure
whether different samples come from the same distribution, without
assuming a given distribution for the population.

Only these two non-parametric tests are presented in detail, since the
test proposed in this paper uses the Kendall-$\tau$ distance and it can
be seen as an extension of the Kendall rank correlation coefficient when
more than two samples are considered, and it is presented as an
alternative to the Kruskal-Wallis statistical test.

The Kendall rank correlation coefficient is a non-parametric measure of
correlation. This measure is based on the Kendall-$\tau$ distance
between two permutations of $n$ elements. The Kendall-$\tau$ distance
($d_{K\text{-}\tau}$) is defined as the number or pairwise disagreements
between two permutations $\pi_1$ and $\pi_2$. For instance, if we have
three elements, the distance from permutation 123 to permutations 132,
231 and 321 is 1, 2 and 3 respectively. The maximum number of
disagreements that may occur between two permutations of $n$ elements is
$n(n-1)/2$ and, in this case, all the values of permutation $\pi_1$ are
in the reverse order of $\pi_2$.

The Kendall rank correlation coefficient between permutations $\pi_1$
and $\pi_2$, denoted by $\tau$, is defined by
$$\tau = 1 -  2 \frac{d_{K\text{-}\tau(\pi_1,\pi_2)}}{n(n-1)/2}.$$ The
Kendall rank correlation coefficient is used as a statistical test to
determine whether there is a relationship or dependence between two
random variables. The main advantages of this coefficient are: the data
can be non-numerical observations if they can be ordered, it is easy to
calculate, and the associated statistical test does not assume a known
distribution of the population from which the samples are taken.

The Kruskal-Wallis test is a non-parametric statistical method to study
whether different samples come from the same population. The test is the
extension of the Mann-Whitney Test [@Wilcoxon1947] when we have more
than two samples or groups. The following example illustrates the
Kruskal-Wallis test when comparing three samples.

::: {#t:example .exmp}
**Example 1**. *[]{#ex:1 label="ex:1"} Let us assume that the
effectiveness of three different treatments ($A$, $B$, $C$) has been
measured for 6 individuals, two individuals being assigned to each of
the treatments, with the effectiveness of each treatment being measured
ordinally. We could obtain the result shown in
Table [1](#t:example){reference-type="ref" reference="t:example"},
where, for example, the effectiveness of treatment $A$ has been rated in
first and third place.*

::: {#t:example}

  : *Result for an experiment with 6 people and 3 treatments.*
:::
:::

The Kruskal-Wallis statistic is determined by the difference between the
ranks of the individuals in each category with the average rank. In our
example, the average rank of the test is $\overline{R}=3.5$, while the
average rank of each of the three treatments are $\overline{R}_A=2$,
$\overline{R}_B=4$ and $\overline{R}_C=4.5$. The Kruskal-Wallis
statistic, denoted by $H$, is based on the calculation of the distance
of each rank to the average rank, which can be expressed as follows:
$$H =  -3(n+1)+\frac{12}{n(n+1)}\sum_{i=1}^k \frac{R_i^2}{n_i},$$ where
$n$ is the number of observations in the $k$ samples, $n_i$ is the
number of observations in the $i$-th sample and $R_i$ is the sum of the
ranks in the $i$-th sample. In our example, the value of the
Kruskal-Wallis statistic is:
$$H =  -3(n+1)+\frac{12}{n(n+1)}\sum_{i=1}^k \frac{R_i^2}{n_i} = -3(6+1)+\frac{12}{6(6+1)}\left (\frac{4^2}{2} + \frac{8^2}{2} + \frac{9^2}{2}  \right ) = 2.$$

Kruskal-Wallis statistic for 3 treatments, each with 2 patients.
Appendix A presents the Kruskal-Wallis statistic for all possible
results in the experiment for 3 treatments with 2 people in each. In

the null probability points.

# The Concordance coefficient $\tau_c$ {#sec:CC}

In [@Aparicio2020], the authors introduce the *Kendall-$\tau$ partition
ranking*; given a ranking of elements of a set and given a disjoint
partition of the same set, the Kendall-$\tau$ partition ranking is the
induced linear order of the subsets of the partition which follows from
the given ranking of elements of a set. The Kendall-$\tau$ partition
ranking presents an ordinal alternative to the mean-based ranking that
uses a pseudo-cardinal scale. Let $\pi$ be permutation of the elements
of set $V$ and let $V_1$, $V_2$, $\ldots$, $V_k$ be a partition of $V$
then, the Kendall-$\tau$ distance from permutation $\pi$ is given by
$$d_{K\text{-}\tau} = \displaystyle \min \{ d_{K\text{-}\tau}(\rho, \pi):\text{ elements in }V_r\text{ are consecutively listed in }\rho,\,\, \forall r \}.$$

This distance is also called the disorder of permutation $\pi$. For the
calculation of the disorder of a permutation of elements, in
[@Aparicio2020], the authors establish that the distance or disorder of
a permutation of elements $\pi = (a|a|b|b|a|c|a|b|c|\cdots|c|a|b)$ is
given by the solution of the Linear Ordering Problem (LOP) with the
preference matrix $M$, where the element $m_{ab}$ of matrix $M$
indicates the number of times that an element $a$ of sample $A$ precedes
an element $b$ of sample $B$ in the order $\pi$. The solution of the
Linear Ordering Problem gives us a new order in the elements of $\pi$,
the closest to $\pi$, in which all the elements belonging to the same
sample are listed consecutively. The book publication by [@Marti2011]
provides an exhaustive study of the Linear Ordering Problem.

The authors [@Aparicio2020] present the properties of the Kendall-$\tau$
partition ranking and compare it with classical mean and median-based
rank approaches. Those properties are extracted from social choice
theory and are adapted to a partition ranking, see
[@arrow1951; @Kemeny1959; @zahid2015]. Two of these properties are only
true for the Kendall-$\tau$ partition ranking: the *Condorcet* and
*Deletion Independence* properties. The Condorcet property establishes
that the most preferred subset must be listed before any other in any
ranking; and the Deletion Independence property establishes that if any
subset is removed, then the induced order of subsets does not change. In
permutation $\pi=(c|c|c|b|b|a|a|c|c)$ the set $C$ is a condorcet winner,
the most preferred set, but $B$ has a lesser mean rank value than set
$C$ if set $A$ is not considered in the comparison; therefore, the
permutation $\pi=(c|c|c|b|b|a|a|c|c)$ gives an example where ranking
subsets from ranks is not very reliable.

From [@Aparicio2020], the maximum number of disagreements that may occur
in a permutation of $n$ elements (where the elements are classified in
$k$ subsets $V_1, V_2,\ldots, V_k$ of sizes $n_1, n_2,\ldots, n_k$
respectively) is
$\sum_{r=1}^k\sum_{s =r+1}^k n_r \, n_s - (GP_{b} +\sum_{r=1}^k\sum_{s =r+1}^k \displaystyle\lfloor\frac{n_r n_s}{2}\displaystyle\rfloor )$,
where $GP_{b}$ is the Generalized Pentagonal Number of $b$, and $b$ the
number of subsets $V_k$ with odd cardinality. The Generalized Pentagonal
number $GP_{b}$, for $b\in \mathbb{N}$, is
$$GP_b=\left\{ \begin{array}{ll}\displaystyle\frac{\ell(3\ell -1)}{2} & b=2\ell \,\, (b \,\, \text{even}),\\  & \\\displaystyle\frac{\ell(3\ell +1)}{2} & b=2\ell +1 \,\, (b \,\, \text{odd}).\\ \end{array} \right.$$
This maximum number of disagreements (the maximum disorder) in a
permutation $\pi$ of elements, allows us to define a relative disorder
coefficient of permutation $\pi$ as
$$relative\,  disorder(\pi) = \frac{\displaystyle d_{K\text{-}\tau}(\pi)}{\displaystyle\sum_{r=1}^k\sum_{s =r+1}^k  n_r \, n_s   -  (GP_{b} +\sum_{r=1}^k\sum_{s =r+1}^k\displaystyle\lfloor\frac{n_r n_s}{2}\displaystyle\rfloor )}.$$

::: definition
**Definition 1**. *We define the Concordance coefficient ($\tau_c$) of
permutation $\pi$ as
$$\tau_c= 1- relative\, disorder(\pi) = 1- \frac{\displaystyle d_{K\text{-}\tau}(\pi)}{\displaystyle\sum_{r=1}^k\sum_{s =r+1}^k  n_r \, n_s   -  (GP_{b} +\sum_{r=1}^k\sum_{s =r+1}^k\displaystyle\lfloor\frac{n_r n_s}{2}\displaystyle\rfloor )} .$$*
:::

The Concordance coefficient ($\tau_c$) provides a measure of
independence in the $k$ samples, where $\tau_c$ is a value between 0 and
1, taking the value of 1 when there is a total order between the
samples, and 0 when the disorder is maximum. In this sense, the
Concordance coefficient can be seen as a generalization of the Kendall
rank correlation coefficient when we have more than two samples. Given
that the Concordance coefficient satisfies the properties mentioned
above, we consider it is more appropriate for measuring differences
between samples than a rank-based method, such as Kruskal-Wallis'.

::: exmp
**Example 2** (Cont.). *Continuing with the data in
Example [\[ex:1\]](#ex:1){reference-type="ref" reference="ex:1"}, the
results of the experiment provide the following order or permutation of
the treatments $\pi=(a|b|a|c|c|b|)$.*
:::

Given the order of individuals $\pi=(a|b|a|c|c|b|)$, the ordering
between individuals that leaves individuals with the same treatment
together is ordination ($a$ $a$ $b$ $b$ $c$ $c$) or ($a$ $a$ $c$ $c$ $b$
$b$). Both ordinations only need 3 pairwise disagreements from the
permutation $\pi$. In order to find the permutation of elements (equal
elements listed consecutively) closer to a given permutation, it is
sufficient to solve the Linear Ordering Problem (LOP) with the
preference matrix defined above. In this example, said matrix is:

where each element of the matrix $m_{ij}$ represents the number of times
an individual of a treatment $i$ precedes an individual of the treatment
$j$. The solution of the LOP is the permutation of treatments which
maximizes the preferences of order in the experiment, that is, in this
example, the permutations of treatments $(A\ B\ C)$ or $(A\ C\ B)$
retain 9 preferences expressed in the order of individuals represented
by the permutation $\pi$. Therefore, the distance of the permutation
$\pi$ to a total order between treatments is $\sum_{i<j} n_i n_j -9 =3$.
This distance, which is the number of pairwise disagreements needed in a
permutation of elements to reach a permutation that establishes a total
order between treatments, is denominated the disorder of a permutation
by the authors of the work by [@Aparicio2020][^1].

Then, the relative disorder of permutation $\pi$ can be evaluated as
$$relative \,disorder(\pi) = \frac{\displaystyle d_{K\text{-}\tau}(\pi)}{\displaystyle\sum_{r=1}^k\sum_{s =r+1}^k  n_r \, n_s   -  (GP_{b} +\sum_{r=1}^k\sum_{s =r+1}^k\displaystyle\lfloor\frac{n_r n_s}{2}\displaystyle\rfloor )} =\frac{\displaystyle 3}{\displaystyle 12  -  (0
+6  )} = \frac{3}{6}=\frac{1}{2},$$ and the Concordance coefficient
$$\tau_c= 1- relative\,disorder(\pi) = 1-\frac{1}{2}=\frac{1}{2}.$$
Notice that no set of this example has odd cardinality, therefore the
pentagonal number is $GP_0=0$.

## The Concordance coefficient in ConcordanceTest package

The R package we have developed allows to calculate both the Concordance
coefficient and the Kruskal-Wallis statistic in order to facilitate
their comparison. Given the high combinatorial degree of the problem of
ordering samples of populations, some of the functions implemented in
the package can perform the calculations exactly, exploring the entire
sample space or possibilities, or they can approximate the sample space
or possibilities by simulation.

The ConcordanceTest package can be installed from CRAN:

::: example
install.packages(\"ConcordanceTest\") library(\"ConcordanceTest\")
:::

and its functions can perform the calculations related only to the
Concordance coefficient (default option, specified with the parameter
H=0) or do them also for the Kruskal-Wallis statistic ( H=1), allowing
their comparison.

To obtain the probability distribution of the statistics, it is
necessary to have the set of all possible permutations that can occur in
the result of the experiment that we want to analyze (90=6!/2!2!2! in
Example [\[ex:1\]](#ex:1){reference-type="ref" reference="ex:1"}). This
can be obtained through the function Permutations_With_Repetition(),
which has been developed and included in the ConcordanceTest package.

The function CT_Distribution() calculates the probability distribution
of the Concordance coefficient and the Kruskal-Wallis statistic. The set
of possibilities (sample space) grows very quickly with the number of
elements and with the number of sets and, in some cases, to calculate
the probability distribution in an exact way becomes unaffordable,
making it necessary to approximate calculations. Both an exact and an
approximate calculation (default option) can be done using the function
CT_Distribution(). It is used as follows:

::: example
CT_Distribution(Sample_Sizes, Num_Sim = 10000, H = 0, verbose = TRUE)
:::

where Sample_Sizes is a numeric vector $(n_1,\ldots,n_k)$ containing the
number of repetitions of each element, i.e., the size of each sample in
the experiment. Num_Sim is the number of simulations to be performed in
order to obtain the probability distribution of the statistics (10,000
by default). If Num_Sim is set to 0, the probability distribution tables
are obtained exactly using the function Permutations_With_Repetition().
H is the parameter specifying whether the calculations must also be
performed for the Kruskal-Wallis statistic, and verbose is a logical
parameter that indicates whether some progress report of the simulations
should be given.

::: exmp
**Example 3** (Cont.). *Using the function CT_Distribution() with
Num_Sim equal to 0, we could obtain the probability distribution of the
Kruskal-Wallis statistic and the Concordance coefficient in
Example [\[ex:1\]](#ex:1){reference-type="ref" reference="ex:1"}
(Tables [2](#t:prob_KW_222){reference-type="ref"
reference="t:prob_KW_222"} and [3](#t:prob_DK_222){reference-type="ref"
reference="t:prob_DK_222"}, respectively) in an exact way. As shown in
this example, we can also approximate the probability distributions of
Example [\[ex:1\]](#ex:1){reference-type="ref" reference="ex:1"} by
simulating, for example, 25,000 permutations of 3 treatments with 2
patients each. Note that, for reproducibility, we always initialize the
generator for pseudo-random numbers when the results rely on
simulation.*

The function CT_Distribution() returns two elements. C_freq is a matrix
with the probability distribution of the Concordance coefficient. Each
row in the matrix contains the disorder, the value of the Concordance
coefficient $\tau_c$, the frequency and its probability. H_freq (only
returned if H = 1) is a matrix with the probability distribution of the
Kruskal-Wallis statistic. Each row in the matrix contains the value of
the statistic $H$, the frequency and its probability. The results
obtained by the function CT_Distribution() are the same as those
previously shown in Table [3](#t:prob_DK_222){reference-type="ref"

# Concordance test {#sec:ConcordanceTest}

In this section, we present the Concordance test in order to evaluate
when different samples come from the same population distribution. The
randomization test introduced by [@Fisher1935] establishes a framework
for the statistical test based on permutations, see also
[@Box1980; @Stern1990; @Welch1990].

If all the samples come from the same distribution, then all possible
ways to rank $n$ observations divided into $k$ samples have the same
probability of occurring. If a result of the experiment provides an
order of the observations with a high disorder, it will support the idea
that all observations come from the same population. On the contrary, a
result with a small disorder will go against the claim that the
observations come from the same population. In this way, we propose to
consider samples that come from the same distribution as null
hypothesis, while the alternative hypothesis is that some of the samples
come from a different distribution.

$H_0$:

:   There is no difference among the $k$ populations.

$H_a$:

:   At least one of the populations differs from the other populations.

The decision rule is to reject the null hypothesis if the disorder in
the permutation of observations is small, equivalently if the
Concordance coefficient $\tau_c$ is close to one. We reject the null
hypothesis $H_0$ at the significance level $\alpha$ if $\tau_c$ is
greater than the percentile $(1-\alpha)\%$ of the probability
distribution of $\tau_c$.

The following example illustrates the use of the Concordance test
proposed in this work and compares it with the classical Kruskal-Wallis
non-parametric test. The comparison will be made first considering that
there are no ties and then modifying the data in the example so that
ties appear.

### Concordance test: {#concordance-test}

The experiment ranks the patients in the following ranking
$$(a\ a\ a\ a\ a\ c\ c\ a\ b\ a\ b\ a\ a\ c\ a\ b\ b\ b).$$

If we perform the contrast using the disorder statistic or the
Concordance coefficient $\tau_c$, we must calculate the permutation of
treatments that maximizes the order between patients obtained in the
experiment. The matrix of preferences between treatments observed is as
follows:

::: center
  ----- ----------------------------------------------------------- ------------------------------------------------- -------------------------------------------------------------
                                       $A$                                                 $B$                                                   $C$    
   $A$   $\left(\begin{array}{r}$--$\\7 \\  11 \end{array}\right.$   $\begin{array}{c}43   \\ $--$\\  13\end{array}$   $\left.\begin{array}{c}19   \\2  \\ $--$\end{array}\right)$
   $B$                                                                                                                
   $C$                                                                                                                
  ----- ----------------------------------------------------------- ------------------------------------------------- -------------------------------------------------------------
:::

The order between treatments that maximizes the order between patients
corresponds to the order $(A\ C\ B)$, satisfying 75 of the 95
preferences contained in the matrix, where the value 75 is the solution
of the Linear Ordering Problem (LOP)[^2]. Therefore, exactly 20 = 95-75
is the number of pairwise disagreements necessary to order the samples
and obtain the order (ACB), that is, the disorder is 20. The greatest
disorder that an order of elements can have with samples of 10, 5 and 3
elements is given by:
$\sum_{r=1}^3\sum_{s =r+1}^3 n_r \, n_s - (GP_{b} +\sum_{r=1}^3\sum_{s =r+1}^3 \displaystyle\lfloor\frac{n_r n_s}{2}\displaystyle\rfloor ) = 95 - (1 + 47) = 47$,
therefore the Concordance coefficient is $\tau_c = 1-20/47= 0.574$. The
p-value of the disorder 20 or, equivalently, of the Concordance
coefficient $\tau_c=0.574$ is 0.049272[^3], therefore, at a level of
significance less than 5% we can reject the null hypothesis of equality
in treatments.

### Kruskal-Wallis test:

The treatments A, B and C have average ranks of 7.3, 14.2 and 9,
respectively, and the sum of ranks are $R_A=73$, $R_B=71$ and $R_C=27$.

The Kruskal-Wallis statistic is given by:
$$H = -3(n+1)+\frac{12}{n(n+1)}\sum \frac{R_i^2}{n_i}= -3(18+1)+\frac{12}{18(18+1)}\left( \frac{73^2}{10} +\frac{71^2}{5}+\frac{27^2}{3}\right)=5.6$$

In [@Meyer2015], exact values for the Kruskal-Wallis contrast at
different levels of significance are found. We can conclude by looking
at the tables that the p-value of the $H$ statistic is greater than
0.05, therefore, we cannot reject the null hypothesis that the
treatments are equally effective.

Comparing both methods, the Concordance and Kruskal-Wallis tests provide
similar results about the statistic but the conclusion differs.

### Concordance test with ties:

The results of the experiment order the individuals according to the
sequence:
$$(a\ a\ a\ a\ (a\ c)\ c\ (a\ b)\ a\ b\ a\ a\ c\ (a\ b)\ b\ b)$$ where
the elements grouped in the order indicates that they tie. There are $8$
different possibilities in order to undo ties in the ranking of
elements. If the same probability is assumed for all of them, the
expected preference matrix between treatments is given distributing the
preference in the comparison of repeated observations with the same
weight, that is, assigning the value 0.5 to each of the treatments when
two tied units are compared. The preference matrix for this example
would be as follows:

::: center
  ----- ------------------------------------------------------------- ------------------------------------------------- ---------------------------------------------------------------
                                        $A$                                                  $B$                                                    $C$    
   $A$   $\left(\begin{array}{r}$--$\\8 \\  11.5 \end{array}\right.$   $\begin{array}{c}42   \\ $--$\\  13\end{array}$   $\left.\begin{array}{c}18.5   \\2  \\ $--$\end{array}\right)$
   $B$                                                                                                                  
   $C$                                                                                                                  
  ----- ------------------------------------------------------------- ------------------------------------------------- ---------------------------------------------------------------
:::

Note that the previous matrix represents the matrix of expected
preferences if all permutations of items with ties in which they are
undone are considered, with the same probability of tie between
elements.

The order between treatments that maximizes the order between patients,
corresponds to the order $(A\ C\ B)$, satisfying 73.5 of the 95
preferences contained in the matrix, where 73.5 is the solution of the
Linear Ordering Problem. Therefore, 21.5 = 95-73.5 is the expected
number of pairwise disagreements necessary to order the samples and
obtain the order $(A\ C\ B)$, that is, the disorder is 21.5 or,
equivalently, the Concordance coefficient is $\tau = 1-21.5/47= 0.543$,
a value with a significance greater than 0.05, $p - value > 0.05$. In
this case, the observed data do not show significant evidence in favor
of a difference in the effectiveness of treatments.

### Kruskal-Wallis test with ties:

The treatments A, B and C have average ranks of 7.45, 14 and 8.83,
respectively, and the sum of ranks are $R_A=74.5$, $R_B=70$ and
$R_C=26.5$.

The Kruskal-Wallis statistic is given by:
$$H = -3(n+1)+\frac{12}{n(n+1)}\sum \frac{R_i^2}{n_i}= -3(18+1)+\frac{12}{18(18+1)}\left( \frac{74.5^2}{10} +\frac{70^2}{5}+\frac{26.5^2}{3}\right)=5.074$$

If we make the adjustment in the statistic for ties, we get:
$$\tilde{H} = \frac{H}{\displaystyle 1-\frac{ \sum_(t_i^3-t_i)}{N^3-N}} = \frac{5.074}{\displaystyle 1-\frac{(2^3-2)+(2^3-2)+(2^3-2)}{18^3-18}}=\displaystyle 5.0897$$

where $t_i$ is the number of ties of each value.

In this case, the Kruskal-Wallis test provides the same conclusion as
the Concordance test; uncertainty being greater when we have ties.

## Concordance test in ConcordanceTest package

The ConcordanceTest R-package allows to perform the hypothesis test for
testing whether samples originate from the same distribution with the
function CT_Hypothesis_Test(), which carries out the calculations by
simulation. It is used as follows:

::: example
CT_Hypothesis_Test(Sample_List, Num_Sim = 10000, H = 0, verbose = TRUE)
:::

where Sample_List is a list of numeric data vectors with the elements of
each sample, Num_Sim is the number of used simulations (10,000 by
default), H specifies whether the Kruskal-Wallis test must also be done,
and verbose is a logical parameter that indicates whether some progress
report of the simulations should be given.

{H} = 1. Note that the approximated p-values obtained by simulation are close to the exact ones, 0.04927 and 0.05223 for the Concordance coefficient and the Kruskal-Wallis statistic, respectively. 

An alternative to the contrast performed with the function \texorpdfstring%

{Num\_Sim} is the number of simulations carried out in order to obtain the probability distribution of the statistics (10,000 by default). If \texorpdfstring%

The function returns a list with two elements. \texorpdfstring%

Note that we can also solve problems with ties (as in

## Other functions in the ConcordanceTest package

The graphical visualization of the probability distributions of the
Concordance coefficient and the Kruskal-Wallis statistic can be done
with the function CT_Probability_Plot(). It is used as follows:

::: example
CT_Probability_Plot(C_freq = NULL, H_freq = NULL)
:::

Using the function CT_Density_Plot() of the ConcordanceTest package, we
can make an approximate representation of the density functions of the
statistics, assuming that the probability distributions represent a
sample of a continuous variable. It is used as follows:

::: example
CT_Density_Plot(C_freq = NULL, H_freq = NULL)
:::

In both functions, C_freq is the probability distribution of the
Concordance coefficient and H_freq is the probability distribution of
the Kruskal-Wallis statistic, obtained exactly or approximately with the
function CT_Distribution(). The function CT_Probability_Plot() can
represent both probability distributions or only one of them (if it only
receives the parameter C_freq or H_freq). Equivalently, the function
CT_Density_Plot() can represent both density distributions or only one
of them. Appendix B presents the empirical density probability functions
for several experiments, where sample sizes vary form $N=(4,4)$ to
$N=(5,5,4,4,4,4,4)$.

that presented by the Concordance coefficient. We can also see that the
Concordance coefficient presents a more symmetrical distribution. This
performance is generalized and, therefore, we consider that the
Concordance coefficient is more reliable than the Kruskal-Wallis
statistic.

The ConcordanceTest package also contains the function LOP(), which
solves the Linear Ordering Problem from a square data matrix. This
function allows to calculate the disorder of a permutation of elements
from the preference matrix induced by that permutation and, therefore,
it is necessary for the calculation of the Concordance coefficient. The
function LOP() is used by functions CT_Distribution(),
CT_Hypothesis_Test() and CT_Coefficient(). It is used as follows:

::: example
LOP(mat_LOP)
:::

where mat_LOP is the preference matrix defining the Linear Ordering
Problem, a numeric square matrix for which we want to obtain the
permutation of rows/columns that maximizes the sum of the elements above
the main diagonal.

The function LOP() returns a list with the following elements: obj_val
is the optimal value of the solution of the Linear Ordering Problem,
that is, the sum of the elements above the main diagonal under the
permutation rows/columns solution, permutation is the solution of the
Linear Ordering Problem, that is, the rows/columns permutation, and
permutation_matrix is the optimal permutation matrix of the Linear
Ordering Problem.

# Comparison with kruskal.test() function from stats package {#sec:kruskal.test}

The well-known stats package contains, among many other functions, the
function kruskal.test() that performs a Kruskal-Wallis rank sum test. In
this section, we compare the results obtained with the ConcordanceTest
package presented in this work and the function kruskal.test(), making
use of the dataset from [@Hollander1973] referenced in the
kruskal.test() examples.

:::
:::

As can be observed, the value of the Kruskal-Wallis statistic is the
same with both functions (0.771). However, the p-values associated with
the statistic differ.

The Kruskal-Wallis statistic follows approximately a $\chi^2$
distribution with degrees of freedom equal to the number of groups minus
1 [@Kruskal1952]. For this reason, the function kruskal.test() uses a
$\chi^2$ distribution to approximate the p-value (using the function
pchisq()). In the case of the function CT_Hypothesis_Test(), it
calculates the p-values using the simulations performed (25,000 in this
example).

The function CT_Distribution() of the ConcordanceTest package allows the
probability distribution tables of the Concordance coefficient and
Kruskal-Wallis statistic to be computed, and they can be obtained
exactly or by simulation. We can get the exact probability distribution
tables and, consequently, the exact p-values in
Example [9](#ex:4){reference-type="ref" reference="ex:4"} with

::: example
CT_Distribution(c(5,4,5), Num_Sim = 0, H = 1)
:::

In Example [9](#ex:4){reference-type="ref" reference="ex:4"}, the exact
p-value for the Kruskal-Wallis statistic is 0.71077. Therefore, the
difference between our p-value obtained with 25,000 simulations
(0.71080) and the exact one is 0.00003, while the difference between the
p-value approximated by the $\chi^2$ distribution (0.68) and the exact
one is 0.03077. Regarding the Concordance coefficient, the exact p-value
is 0.78468, hence, the difference between our p-value obtained with
25,000 simulations (0.78408) and the exact one is 0.0006.

It is worth noting that the function kruskal.test() uses the $\chi^2$
distribution to approximate the p-value regardless of the size of the
samples, but [@Kruskal1952] state that the Kruskal-Wallis statistic is
distributed approximately as a $\chi^2$, unless the samples are too
small, in which case special approximations or exact tables should be
provided. On the contrary, the ConcordanceTest package can always obtain
a good approximation of the p-values, regardless of the size of the
samples, as long as a high number of simulations is used.

# Final remarks and future research {#sec:conclusion}

A new measure based on the Kendall-$\tau$ distance is presented in this
work to estimate the *concordance* of different samples. A statistical
test to determine when different observations come from the same
distribution is also introduced. A comparison with the classical
Kruskal-Wallis test is introduced to show that both tests differ. As we
have shown, the proposed coefficient is more appropriate and reliable
than rank-based methods. This work also describes the R package
ConcordanceTest [@ConcordanceTest2022], which contains all the functions
needed to work with the proposed Concordance coefficient and allows its
comparison with the Kruskal-Wallis statistic.

This work aims to be an introduction of the new concordance measure
between samples, but there still remains much to be done. There is a new
problem and further challenges for researchers, for example: studying
the asymptotic distribution of the Concordance coefficient, exploring
the possibility of finding the exact distribution with the help of
modern computing, or analyzing the power of the Concordance test
presented in this work, among others.

# Appendix C: Concordance coefficient p-values {#A:CCtables}

In order to compute the probability distribution of the Concordance
coefficient, the enumeration of all the permutations of elements from an
order is required. Note for example that if we have 4 samples with 6
elements each, $N=(6,6,6,6)$, the number of possible results in the
experiment is $24!/6!6!6!6!$ $= 2.15433\cdot 10 ^{20}$. The total
computational time to compute the Concordance coefficient for all
$2.15433\cdot 10 ^{20}$ possibilities was more than 60 days in an
Intel(R) Xeon (R) processor CPU E5-2650 v3 @ 2.30 GHz, 20 cores and RAM
64 GiB. Algorithm [\[alg:pvalues\]](#alg:pvalues){reference-type="ref"
reference="alg:pvalues"} presents the recursive function used to
evaluate the Concordance coefficient probability distribution.

[^1]: If the number of samples is small, we can evaluate all the
    possibilities in order to obtain the solution of the Linear Ordering
    Problem, for example, if we have 3 samples the number of feasible
    solutions for the LOP is $3!=6$.

[^2]: The solution of LOP for this example is the permutation of sets
    that maximizes the preferences in the preference matrix. It is
    sufficient to compare the 6 possibilities, $(A\ B\ C) = 64$,
    $(A\ C\ B) = 75$, $(B\ A\ C) = 28$, $(B\ C\ A) = 20$,
    $(C\ A\ B) = 67$ and $(C\ B\ A) = 31$.

[^3]: Tables of p-values for the Concordance coefficient $\tau_c$ are in
    Appendix C.
