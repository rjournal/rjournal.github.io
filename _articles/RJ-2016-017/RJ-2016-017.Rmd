title: 'scmamp: Statistical Comparison of Multiple Algorithms in Multiple Problems'
abstract: Comparing the results obtained by two or more algorithms in a set of problems
  is a central task in areas such as machine learning or optimization. Drawing conclusions
  from these comparisons may require the use of statistical tools such as hypothesis
  testing. There are some interesting papers that cover this topic. In this manuscript
  we present scmamp, an R package aimed at being a tool that simplifies the whole
  process of analyzing the results obtained when comparing algorithms, from loading
  the data to the production of plots and tables. Comparing the performance of different
  algorithms is an essential step in many research and practical computational works.
  When new algorithms are proposed, they have to be compared with the state of the
  art. Similarly, when an algorithm is used for a particular problem, its performance
  with different sets of parameters has to be compared, in order to tune them for
  the best results. When the differences are very clear (e.g., when an algorithm is
  the best in all the problems used in the comparison), the direct comparison of the
  results may be enough. However, this is an unusual situation and, thus, in most
  situations a direct comparison may be misleading and not enough to draw sound conclusions;
  in those cases, the statistical assessment of the results is advisable. The statistical
  comparison of algorithms in the context of machine learning has been covered in
  several papers. In particular, the tools implemented in this package are those presented
  in Demšar (2006); García and Herrera (2008); García et al. (2010). Another good
  review that covers, among other aspects, the statistical assessment of the results
  in the context of supervised classification can be found in Santafé et al. (2015).
