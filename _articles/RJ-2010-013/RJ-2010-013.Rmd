title: Solving Differential Equations in R
abstract: Although R is still predominantly applied for statistical analysis and graphical
  representation, it is rapidly becoming more suitable for mathematical computing.
  One of the fields where considerable progress has been made recently is the solution
  of differential equations. Here we give a brief overview of differential equations
  that can now be solved by R.
