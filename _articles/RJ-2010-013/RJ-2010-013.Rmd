# Introduction

Differential equations describe exchanges of matter, energy, information
or any other quantities, often as they vary in time and/or space. Their
thorough analytical treatment forms the basis of fundamental theories in
mathematics and physics, and they are increasingly applied in chemistry,
life sciences and economics.

Differential equations are solved by integration, but unfortunately, for
many practical applications in science and engineering, systems of
differential equations cannot be integrated to give an analytical
solution, but rather need to be solved numerically.

Many advanced numerical algorithms that solve differential equations are
available as (open-source) computer codes, written in programming
languages like FORTRAN or C and that are available from repositories
like GAMS (<http://gams.nist.gov/>) or NETLIB
([www.netlib.org](http://www.netlib.org){.uri}).

Depending on the problem, mathematical formalisations may consist of
ordinary differential equations (ODE), partial differential equations
(PDE), differential algebraic equations (DAE), or delay differential
equations (DDE). In addition, a distinction is made between initial
value problems (IVP) and boundary value problems (BVP).

With the introduction of R-package `odesolve` [@odesolve], it became
possible to use R [@R2009] for solving very simple initial value
problems of systems of ordinary differential equations, using the
`lsoda` algorithm of @Hindmarsh1983 and @Petzold1983. However, many
real-life applications, including physical transport modeling,
equilibrium chemistry or the modeling of electrical circuits, could not
be solved with this package.

Since `odesolve`, much effort has been made to improve R's capabilities
to handle differential equations, mostly by incorporating published and
well tested numerical codes, such that now a much more complete
repertoire of differential equations can be numerically solved.

More specifically, the following types of differential equations can now
be handled with add-on packages in R:

-   Initial value problems (IVP) of ordinary differential equations
    (ODE), using package
    [*deSolve*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=deSolve)
    [@Soetaert2010].

-   Initial value differential algebraic equations (DAE), package
    [*deSolve*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=deSolve) .

-   Initial value partial differential equations (PDE), packages
    [*deSolve*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=deSolve) and
    [*ReacTran*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=ReacTran)
    [@ReacTran].

-   Boundary value problems (BVP) of ordinary differential equations,
    using package
    [*bvpSolve*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=bvpSolve)
    [@bvpSolve], or
    [*ReacTran*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=ReacTran) and
    [*rootSolve*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=rootSolve)
    [@rootSolve].

-   Initial value delay differential equations (DDE), using packages
    [*deSolve*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=deSolve) or
    [*PBSddesolve*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=PBSddesolve)
    [@PBSddesolve].

-   Stochastic differential equations (SDE), using packages
    [*sde*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=sde) [@sde] and
    [*pomp*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=pomp) [@pomp].

In this short overview, we demonstrate how to solve the first four types
of differential equations in R. It is beyond the scope to give an
exhaustive overview about the vast number of methods to solve these
differential equations and their theory, so the reader is encouraged to
consult one of the numerous textbooks [e.g.,
@Ascher98; @Press2007; @Hairer1; @Hairer2; @LeVeque2007 and many
others].

In addition, a large number of analytical and numerical methods exists
for the analysis of bifurcations and stability properties of
deterministic systems, the efficient simulation of stochastic
differential equations or the estimation of parameters. We do not deal
with these methods here.

# Types of differential equations

## Ordinary differential equations

Ordinary differential equations describe the change of a *state
variable* $y$ as a function $f$ of one *independent variable* $t$ (e.g.,
time or space), of $y$ itself, and, optionally, a set of other variables
$p$, often called *parameters*:

$$\begin{aligned}
y' &= \frac{dy}{dt} = f(t, y, p)
\end{aligned}$$

In many cases, solving differential equations requires the introduction
of extra conditions. In the following, we concentrate on the numerical
treatment of two classes of problems, namely initial value problems and
boundary value problems.

### Initial value problems

If the extra conditions are specified at the initial value of the
independent variable, the differential equations are called **initial
value problems** (IVP).

There exist two main classes of algorithms to numerically solve such
problems, so-called *Runge-Kutta* formulas and *linear multistep*
formulas [@Hairer1; @Hairer2]. The latter contains two important
families, the Adams family and the backward differentiation formulae
(BDF).

Another important distinction is between *explicit* and *implicit*
methods, where the latter methods can solve a particular class of
equations (so-called "stiff" equations) where explicit methods have
problems with stability and efficiency. Stiffness occurs for instance if
a problem has components with different rates of variation according to
the independent variable. Very often there will be a tradeoff between
using explicit methods that require little work per integration step and
implicit methods which are able to take larger integration steps, but
need (much) more work for one step.

In R, initial value problems can be solved with functions from package
[*deSolve*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=deSolve) [@Soetaert2010],
which implements many solvers from ODEPACK [@Hindmarsh1983], the code
`vode` [@Brown89], the differential algebraic equation solver `daspk`
[@Brenan96], all belonging to the linear multistep methods, and
comprising Adams methods as well as backward differentiation formulae.
The former methods are explicit, the latter implicit. In addition, this
package contains a de-novo implementation of a rather general
Runge-Kutta solver based on @Dormand1980
[@Prince1981; @Bogacki1989; @Cash1990] and using ideas from @Butcher1987
and @Press2007. Finally, the implicit Runge-Kutta method `radau`
[@Hairer1] has been added recently.

### Boundary value problems

If the extra conditions are specified at different values of the
independent variable, the differential equations are called **boundary
value problems** (BVP). A standard textbook on this subject is
@Ascher95.

Package [*bvpSolve*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=bvpSolve)
[@bvpSolve] implements three methods to solve boundary value problems.
The simplest solution method is the *single shooting method*, which
combines initial value problem integration with a nonlinear root finding
algorithm [@Press2007]. Two more stable solution methods implement a
mono implicit Runge-Kutta (MIRK) code, based on the FORTRAN code
`twpbvpC` [@CashMazz], and the collocation method, based on the FORTRAN
code `colnew` [@Bader]. Some boundary value problems can also be solved
with functions from packages
[*ReacTran*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=ReacTran) and
[*rootSolve*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=rootSolve) (see below).

## Partial differential equations

In contrast to ODEs where there is only one independent variable,
partial differential equations (PDE) contain partial derivatives with
respect to more than one independent variable, for instance $t$ (time)
and $x$ (a spatial dimension). To distinguish this type of equations
from ODEs, the derivatives are represented with the $\partial$ symbol,
e.g. $$\begin{aligned}
\frac{\partial y}{\partial t} &= f(t, x, y, \frac{\partial y}{\partial x}, p)
\end{aligned}$$ Partial differential equations can be solved by
subdividing one or more of the continuous independent variables in a
number of grid cells, and replacing the derivatives by discrete,
algebraic approximate equations, so-called finite differences [cf.
@LeVeque2007; @Hundsdorfer].

For time-varying cases, it is customary to discretise the spatial
coordinate(s) only, while time is left in continuous form. This is
called the method-of-lines, and in this way, one PDE is translated into
a large number of coupled ordinary differential equations, that can be
solved with the usual initial value problem solvers [cf. @Hamdi2007].
This applies to parabolic PDEs such as the heat equation, and to
hyperbolic PDEs such as the wave equation.

For time-invariant problems, usually all independent variables are
discretised, and the derivatives approximated by algebraic equations,
which are solved by root-finding techniques. This technique applies to
elliptic PDEs.

R-package [*ReacTran*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=ReacTran)
provides functions to generate finite differences on a structured grid.
After that, the resulting time-varying cases can be solved with
specially-designed functions from package
[*deSolve*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=deSolve), while
time-invariant cases can be solved with root-solving methods from
package [*rootSolve*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=rootSolve) .

## Differential algebraic equations

Differential-algebraic equations (DAE) contain a mixture of differential
($f$) and algebraic equations ($g$), the latter e.g.¬†for maintaining
mass-balance conditions: $$\begin{aligned}
y' &= f(t, y, p) \\
0  &= g(t, y, p)
\end{aligned}$$ Important for the solution of a DAE is its index. The
index of a DAE is the number of differentiations needed until a system
consisting only of ODEs is obtained.

Function `daspk` [@Brenan96] from package
[*deSolve*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=deSolve) solves
(relatively simple) DAEs of index at most 1, while function `radau`
[@Hairer1] solves DAEs of index up to 3.

# Implementation details

The implemented solver functions are explained by means of the
`ode`-function, used for the solution of initial value problems. The
interfaces to the other solvers have an analogous definition:

``` r
 ode(y, times, func, parms, method = c("lsoda", 
     "lsode", "lsodes", "lsodar", 
     "vode", "daspk", "euler", "rk4", 
     "ode23", "ode45", "radau", "bdf", 
     "bdf_d", "adams", "impAdams", 
     "impAdams_d"), ...)
```

To use this, the system of differential equations can be defined as an
R-function (`func`) that computes derivatives in the ODE system (the
model definition) according to the independent variable (e.g.¬†time `t`).
`func` can also be a function in a dynamically loaded shared library
[@compiledCode] and, in addition, some solvers support also the supply
of an analytically derived function of partial derivatives (Jacobian
matrix).

If `func` is an R-function, it must be defined as:

`func <- function(t, y, parms, ...)`

where `t` is the actual value of the independent variable (e.g.¬†the
current time point in the integration), `y` is the current estimate of
the variables in the ODE system, `parms` is the parameter vector and
`...` can be used to pass additional arguments to the function.

The return value of `func` should be a list, whose first element is a
vector containing the derivatives of `y` with respect to `t`, and whose
next elements are optional global values that can be recorded at each
point in `times`. The derivatives must be specified in the same order as
the state variables `y`.

Depending on the algorithm specified in argument `method`, numerical
simulation proceeds either exactly at the time steps specified in
`times`, or using time steps that are independent from `times` and where
the output is generated by interpolation. With the exception of method
`euler` and several fixed-step Runge-Kutta methods all algorithms have
automatic time stepping, which can be controlled by setting accuracy
requirements (see below) or by using optional arguments like `hini`
(initial time step), `hmin` (minimal time step) and `hmax` (maximum time
step). Specific details, e.g.¬†about the applied interpolation methods
can be found in the manual pages and the original literature cited
there.

# Numerical accuracy

Numerical solution of a system of differential equations is an
approximation and therefore prone to numerical errors, originating from
several sources:

1.  time step and accuracy order of the solver,

2.  floating point arithmetics,

3.  properties of the differential system and stability of the solution
    algorithm.

For methods with automatic stepsize selection, accuracy of the
computation can be adjusted using the non-negative arguments `atol`
(absolute tolerance) and `rtol` (relative tolerance), which control the
local errors of the integration.

Like R itself, all solvers use double-precision floating-point
arithmetics according to @IEEE754, which means that it can represent
numbers between approx. $\pm 2.25~ 10^{-308}$ to approx.
$\pm 1.8~ 10^{308}$ and with 16 significant digits. It is therefore not
advisable to set $\mathbf{rtol}$ below $10^{-16}$, except setting it to
zero with the intention to use absolute tolerance exclusively.

The solvers provided by the packages presented below have proven to be
quite robust in most practical cases, however users should always be
aware about the problems and limitations of numerical methods and
carefully check results for plausibility. The section "Troubleshooting"
in the package vignette [@deSolveVignette] should be consulted as a
first source for solving typical problems.

# Examples

## An initial value ODE

Consider the famous van der Pol equation [@vanderPol1927], that
describes a non-conservative oscillator with non-linear damping and
which was originally developed for electrical circuits employing vacuum
tubes. The oscillation is described by means of a $2^{nd}$ order ODE:
$$z'' - \mu (1-z^2) z' + z = 0$$ Such a system can be routinely
rewritten as a system of two $1^{st}$ order ODEs, if we substitute $z''$
with $y_1'$ and $z'$ with $y_2$: $$\begin{aligned}
  y_1' &= y_2\\
  y_2' &= \mu \cdot (1-{y_1}^2) \cdot y_2 - y_1
\end{aligned}$$

There is one parameter, $\mu$, and two differential variables, $y_1$ and
$y_2$ with initial values (at $t=0$): $$\begin{aligned}
  y_{1_{(t=0)}} &= 2\\
  y_{2_{(t=0)}} &= 0
\end{aligned}$$

The van der Pol equation is often used as a test problem for ODE
solvers, as, for large $\mu$, its dynamics consists of parts where the
solution changes very slowly, alternating with regions of very sharp
changes. This "stiffness" makes the equation quite challenging to solve.

In R, this model is implemented as a function (`vdpol`) whose inputs are
the current time (`t`), the values of the state variables (`y`), and the
parameters (`mu`); the function returns a `list` with as first element
the derivatives, concatenated.

``` r
 vdpol <- function (t, y, mu) {
   list(c(
     y[2],
     mu * (1 - y[1]^2) * y[2] - y[1]
   ))
 }
```

After defining the initial condition of the state variables (`yini`),
the model is solved, and output written at selected time points
(`times`), using
[*deSolve*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=deSolve)'s integration
function `ode`. The default routine `lsoda`, which is invoked by `ode`
automatically switches between stiff and non-stiff methods, depending on
the problem [@Petzold1983].

We run the model for a typically stiff (`mu = 1000`) and nonstiff
(`mu = 1`) situation:

``` r
 library(deSolve)
 yini <- c(y1 = 2, y2 = 0)
 stiff <- ode(y = yini, func = vdpol, 
     times = 0:3000, parms = 1000)
```

``` r
 nonstiff <- ode(y = yini, func = vdpol, 
     times = seq(0, 30, by = 0.01), 
     parms = 1)
```

The model returns a matrix, of class `deSolve`, with in its first column
the time values, followed by the values of the state variables:

``` r
 head(stiff, n = 3)
```

``` r
     time       y1            y2
[1,]    0 2.000000  0.0000000000
[2,]    1 1.999333 -0.0006670373
[3,]    2 1.998666 -0.0006674088
```

Figures are generated using the S3 plot method for objects of class
`deSolve`:

``` r
 plot(stiff, type = "l", which = "y1",
   lwd = 2, ylab = "y",
   main = "IVP ODE, stiff")
```

``` r
 plot(nonstiff, type = "l", which = "y1",
   lwd = 2, ylab = "y",
   main = "IVP ODE, nonstiff")
```

:::

A comparison of timings for two explicit solvers, the Runge-Kutta method
(`ode23`) and the `adams` method, with the implicit multistep solver
(`bdf`, backward differentiation formula) shows a clear advantage for
the latter in the stiff case (Figure [1](#tab:vdpol)). The default
solver (`lsoda`) is not necessarily the fastest, but shows robust
behavior due to automatic stiffness detection. It uses the explicit
multistep Adams method for the non-stiff case and the BDF method for the
stiff case. The accuracy is comparable for all solvers with
$\mathtt{atol} = \mathtt{rtol} = 10^{-6}$, the default.

## A boundary value ODE

The webpage of Jeff Cash [@Cashweb] contains many test cases, including
their analytical solution (see below), that BVP solvers should be able
to solve. We use equation no.¬†14 from this webpage as an example:
$$\begin{aligned}
  \xi y''- y &= -(\xi \pi^2 +1) \cos(\pi x)
\end{aligned}$$ on the interval $[-1, 1]$, and subject to the boundary
conditions: $$\begin{aligned}
  y_{(x=-1)} &= 0 \\
  y_{(x=+1)} &= 0
\end{aligned}$$ The second-order equation first is rewritten as two
first-order equations: $$\begin{aligned}
  y_1'&= y_2\\
  y_2'&= 1/\xi \cdot (y_1 -(\xi \pi^2 +1) \cos(\pi x))\\
\end{aligned}$$ It is implemented in R as:

``` r
 Prob14 <- function(x, y, xi)  {
   list(c(
     y[2],
     1/xi * (y[1] - (xi*pi*pi+1) * cos(pi*x))
   ))
 }
```

With decreasing values of $\xi$, this problem becomes increasingly
difficult to solve. We use three values of $\xi$, and solve the problem
with the shooting, the MIRK and the collocation method [@Ascher95].

Note how the initial conditions `yini` and the conditions at the end of
the integration interval `yend` are specified, where `NA` denotes that
the value is not known. The independent variable is called `x` here
(rather than `times` in `ode`).

``` r
 library(bvpSolve)
 x <- seq(-1, 1, by = 0.01)
 shoot <- bvpshoot(yini = c(0, NA), 
     yend = c(0, NA), x = x, parms = 0.01, 
     func = Prob14)
```

``` r
 twp <- bvptwp(yini = c(0, NA), yend = c(0, 
     NA), x = x, parms = 0.0025, 
     func = Prob14)
```

``` r
 coll <- bvpcol(yini = c(0, NA), 
     yend = c(0, NA), x = x, parms = 1e-04, 
     func = Prob14)
```

The numerical approximation generated by `bvptwp` is very close to the
analytical solution, e.g.¬†for $\xi = 0.0025$:

``` r
 xi <- 0.0025
 analytic <- cos(pi * x) + exp((x - 
     1)/sqrt(xi)) + exp(-(x + 1)/sqrt(xi))
 max(abs(analytic - twp[, 2]))
```

``` r
[1] 7.788209e-10
```

A similar low discrepancy ($4\cdot 10^{-11}$) is noted for the
$\xi = 0.0001$ as solved by `bvpcol`; the shooting method is
considerably less precise ($1.4 \cdot 10^{-5}$), although the same
tolerance ($\mathtt{atol} = 10^{-8}$) was used for all runs.

The plot shows how the shape of the solution is affected by the
parameter $\xi$, becoming more and more steep near the boundaries, and
therefore more and more difficult to solve, as $\xi$ gets smaller.

``` r
 plot(shoot[, 1], shoot[, 2], type = "l", lwd = 2,
   ylim = c(-1, 1), col = "blue",
   xlab = "x", ylab = "y", main = "BVP ODE")
 lines(twp[, 1], twp[, 2], col = "red", lwd = 2)
 lines(coll[, 1], coll[, 2], col = "green", lwd = 2)
 legend("topright", legend = c("0.01", "0.0025",
   "0.0001"), col = c("blue", "red", "green"),
   title = expression(xi), lwd = 2)
```

parameter $\xi$.](SoetaertPetzoldtSetzer-prob14.png){#fig:pr14

## Differential algebraic equations

The so called "Rober problem" describes an autocatalytic reaction
[@Robertson1966] between three chemical species, $y_1$, $y_2$ and $y_3$.
The problem can be formulated either as an ODE [@testset], or as a DAE:
$$\begin{aligned}
y_1' &= -0.04 y_1 + 10^4 y_2 y_3\\
y_2' &= 0.04 y_1 - 10^4 y_2 y_3 - 3 10^7 y_2^2\\
   1 &= y_1 + y_2 + y_3
\end{aligned}$$

where the first two equations are differential equations that specify
the dynamics of chemical species $y_1$ and $y_2$, while the third
algebraic equation ensures that the summed concentration of the three
species remains $1$.

The DAE has to be specified by the *residual function* instead of the
rates of change (as in ODEs). $$\begin{aligned}
r_1 &= - y_1' - 0.04 y_1 + 10^4 y_2 y_3\\
r_2 &= - y_2' + 0.04 y_1 - 10^4 y_2 y_3 - 3~10^7 y_2^2\\
r_3 &= - 1 + y_1 + y_2 + y_3
\end{aligned}$$

Implemented in R this becomes:

``` r
 daefun<-function(t, y, dy, parms) {
     res1 <- - dy[1] - 0.04 * y[1] +
               1e4 * y[2] * y[3]
     res2 <- - dy[2] + 0.04 * y[1] -
               1e4 * y[2] * y[3] - 3e7 * y[2]^2
     res3 <- y[1] + y[2] + y[3] - 1
     list(c(res1, res2, res3),
          error = as.vector(y[1] + y[2] + y[3]) - 1)
 }
```

``` r
 yini  <- c(y1 = 1, y2 = 0, y3 = 0)
 dyini <- c(-0.04, 0.04, 0)
 times <- 10 ^ seq(-6,6,0.1)
```

The input arguments of function `daefun` are the current time (`t`), the
values of the state variables and their derivatives (`y, dy`) and the
parameters (`parms`). It returns the residuals, concatenated and an
output variable, the error in the algebraic equation. The latter is
added to check upon the accuracy of the results.

For DAEs solved with `daspk`, both the state variables and their
derivatives need to be initialised (`y` and `dy`). Here we make sure
that the initial conditions for `y` obey the algebraic constraint, while
also the initial condition of the derivatives is consistent with the
dynamics.

``` r
 library(deSolve)
 print(system.time(out <-daspk(y = yini,
   dy = dyini, times = times, res = daefun,
   parms = NULL)))
```

``` r
   user  system elapsed 
   0.07    0.00    0.11 
```

An S3 `plot` method can be used to plot all variables at once:

``` r
 plot(out, ylab = "conc.", xlab = "time",
   type = "l", lwd = 2, log = "x")
 mtext("IVP DAE", side = 3, outer = TRUE,
   line = -1)
```

There is a very fast initial change in concentrations, mainly due to the
quick reaction between $y_1$ and $y_2$ and amongst $y_2$. After that,
the slow reaction of $y_1$ with $y_2$ causes the system to change much
more smoothly. This is typical for stiff problems.

![Figure 4: Solution of the DAE problem for the substances $y_1$,$y_2$,
$y_3$; mass balance error: deviation of total sum from
one.](SoetaertPetzoldtSetzer-figdae.png){#fig:dae width="100%" alt="graphic without alt text"}

## Partial differential equations

In **partial differential equations** (PDE), the function has several
independent variables (e.g.¬†time and depth) and contains their partial
derivatives.

Many partial differential equations can be solved by numerical
approximation (finite differencing) after rewriting them as a set of
ODEs [see @Schiesser91; @LeVeque2007; @Hundsdorfer].

Functions `tran.1D`, `tran.2D`, and `tran.3D` from R package
[*ReacTran*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=ReacTran) [@ReacTran]
implement finite difference approximations of the diffusive-advective
transport equation which, for the 1-D case, is: $$\begin{aligned}
  -\frac{1}{A_x}\cdot \left[\frac{\partial}{\partial x}
    A_x \left(-  D  \cdot \frac{\partial C}{\partial x}\right)
    - \frac{\partial}{\partial x}
    (A_x \cdot u  \cdot C)\right]
\end{aligned}$$ Here $D$ is the "diffusion coefficient", $u$ is the
"advection rate", and $A_x$ is some property (e.g.¬†surface area) that
depends on the independent variable, $x$.

It should be noted that the accuracy of the finite difference
approximations can not be specified in the
[*ReacTran*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=ReacTran) functions. It
is up to the user to make sure that the solutions are sufficiently
accurate, e.g.¬†by including more grid points.

### One dimensional PDE

Diffusion-reaction models are a fundamental class of models which
describe how concentration of matter, energy, information, etc. evolves
in space and time under the influence of diffusive transport and
transformation [@Soetaert08].

As an example, consider the 1-D diffusion-reaction model in $[0, 10]$:
$$\begin{aligned}
  \frac{\partial C}{\partial t} &= \frac{\partial}{\partial x}
    \left(D  \cdot \frac{\partial C}{\partial x}\right)  - Q
\end{aligned}$$ with $C$ the concentration, `t` the time, `x` the
distance from the origin, `Q`, the consumption rate, and with boundary
conditions (values at the model edges): $$\begin{aligned}
  \frac{\partial C}{\partial x}_{x=0} &= 0 \\
  C_{x=10} &= C_{ext}
\end{aligned}$$ To solve this model in R, first the 1-D model `Grid` is
defined; it divides 10‚ÄÜcm (`L`) into 1000 boxes (`N`).

``` r
 library(ReacTran)
 Grid <- setup.grid.1D(N = 1000, L = 10)
```

The model equation includes a transport term, approximated by
[*ReacTran*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=ReacTran) function
`tran.1D` and a consumption term (`Q`). The downstream boundary
condition, prescribed as a concentration (`C.down`) needs to be
specified, the zero-gradient at the upstream boundary is the default:

``` r
 pde1D <-function(t, C, parms)  {
   tran <- tran.1D(C = C, D = D,
                   C.down = Cext, dx = Grid)$dC
   list(tran - Q)  # return value: rate of change
 }
```

The model parameters are:

``` r
 D    <- 1    # diffusion constant
 Q    <- 1    # uptake rate
 Cext <- 20
```

In a first application, the model is solved to *steady-state*, which
retrieves the condition where the concentrations are invariant:
$$0 = \frac{\partial}{\partial x}
    \left(D  \cdot \frac{\partial C}{\partial x}\right)  - Q$$ In R,
steady-state conditions can be estimated using functions from package
[*rootSolve*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=rootSolve) which
implement amongst others a Newton-Raphson algorithm [@Press2007]. For
1-dimensional models, `steady.1D` is most efficient. The initial "guess"
of the steady-state solution (`y`) is unimportant; here we take simply
`N` random numbers. Argument `nspec = 1` informs the solver that only
one component is described.

Although a system of 1000 equations needs to be solved, this takes only
a fraction of a second:

``` r
 library(rootSolve)
 print(system.time(
 std   <- steady.1D(y = runif(Grid$N),
   func = pde1D, parms = NULL, nspec = 1)
 ))
```

``` r
   user  system elapsed 
   0.02    0.00    0.02 
```

The values of the state-variables (`y`) are plotted against the
distance, in the middle of the grid cells (`Grid$x.mid`).

``` r
 plot (Grid$x.mid, std$y, type = "l",
   lwd = 2, main = "steady-state PDE",
   xlab = "x", ylab = "C", col = "red")
```

![Figure 5: Steady-state solution of the 1-D diffusion-reaction
model.](SoetaertPetzoldtSetzer-figpde.png){#fig:pde width="100%" alt="graphic without alt text"}

The analytical solution compares well with the numerical approximation:

``` r
 analytical <- Q/2/D*(Grid$x.mid^2 - 10^2) + Cext
 max(abs(analytical - std$y))
```

``` r
[1] 1.250003e-05
```

Next the model is run dynamically for 100 time units using
[*deSolve*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=deSolve) function
`ode.1D`, and starting with a uniform concentration:

``` r
 require(deSolve)
 times <- seq(0, 100, by = 1)
 system.time(
   out <- ode.1D(y = rep(1, Grid$N),
     times = times, func = pde1D,
     parms = NULL, nspec = 1)
 )
```

``` r
   user  system elapsed 
   0.61    0.02    0.63 
```

Here, `out` is a matrix, whose $1^{st}$ column contains the output
times, and the next columns the values of the state variables in the
different boxes; we print the first columns of the last three rows of
this matrix:

``` r
 tail(out[, 1:4], n = 3)
```

``` r
       time         1         2         3
[99,]    98 -27.55783 -27.55773 -27.55754
[100,]   99 -27.61735 -27.61725 -27.61706
[101,]  100 -27.67542 -27.67532 -27.67513
```

We plot the result using a blue-yellow-red color scheme, and using
`deSolve`'s S3 method `image`. Figure [6](#fig:yy) shows that, as time
proceeds, gradients develop from the uniform distribution, until the
system almost reaches steady-state at the end of the simulation.

``` r
 image(out, xlab = "time, days",
       ylab = "Distance, cm",
       main = "PDE", add.contour = TRUE)
```

![Figure 6: Dynamic solution of the 1-D diffusion-reaction
model.](SoetaertPetzoldtSetzer-yyfig.png){#fig:yy width="100%" alt="graphic without alt text"}

It should be noted that the steady-state model is effectively a boundary
value problem, while the transient model is a prototype of a "parabolic"
partial differential equation [@LeVeque2007].

Whereas R can also solve the other two main classes of PDEs, i.e.¬†of the
"hyperbolic" and "elliptic" type, it is well beyond the scope of this
paper to elaborate on that.

# Discussion

Although R is still predominantly applied for statistical analysis and
graphical representation, it is more and more suitable for mathematical
computing, e.g.¬†in the field of matrix algebra [@Matrix]. Thanks to the
differential equation solvers, R is also emerging as a powerful
environment for dynamic simulations
[@Petzoldt03; @Soetaert08; @Stevens09].

The new package [*deSolve*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=deSolve)
has retained all the funtionalities of its predecessor
[*odesolve*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=odesolve) [@odesolve],
such as the potential to define models both in R code, or in compiled
languages. However, compared to
[*odesolve*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=odesolve), it includes a
more complete set of integrators, and a more extensive set of options to
tune the integration routines, it provides more complete output, and has
extended the applicability domain to include also DDEs, DAEs and PDEs.

Thanks to the DAE solvers `daspk` [@Brenan96] and `radau` [@Hairer2] it
is now also possible to model electronic circuits or equilibrium
chemical systems. These problems are often of index $\leq 1$. In many
mechanical systems, physical constraints lead to DAEs of index up to 3,
and these more complex problems can be solved with `radau`.

The inclusion of BVP and PDE solvers have opened up the application area
to the field of reactive transport modelling [@ReacTran], such that R
can now be used to describe quantities that change not only in time, but
also along one or more spatial axes. We use it to model how ecosystems
change along rivers, or in sediments, but it could equally serve to
model the growth of a tumor in human brains, or the dispersion of
toxicants in human tissues.

The open source matrix language R has great potential for dynamic
modelling, and the tools currently available are suitable for solving a
wide variety of practical and scientific problems. The performance is
sufficient even for larger systems, especially when models can be
formulated using matrix algebra or are implemented in compiled languages
like C or Fortran [@Soetaert2010]. Indeed, there is emerging interest in
performing statistical analysis on differential equations, e.g.¬†in
package [*nlmeODE*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=nlmeODE)
[@Tornoe2004] for fitting non-linear mixed-effects models using
differential equations, package
[*FME*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=FME) [@FME] for sensitivity
analysis, parameter estimation and Markov chain Monte-Carlo analysis or
package [*ccems*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=ccems) for
combinatorially complex equilibrium model selection
[@Radivoyevitch2009].

However, there is ample room for extensions and improvements. For
instance, the PDE solvers are quite memory intensive, and could benefit
from the implementation of sparse matrix solvers that are more efficient
in this respect[^2]. In addition, the methods implemented in
[*ReacTran*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=ReacTran) handle
equations defined on very simple shapes only. Extending the PDE approach
to finite elements [@Strang1973] would open up the application domain of
R to any irregular geometry. Other spatial discretisation schemes could
be added, e.g.¬†for use in fluid dynamics.

Our models are often applied to derive unknown parameters by fitting
them against data; this relies on the availability of apt parameter
fitting algorithms.

Discussion of these items is highly welcomed, in the new special
interest group about dynamic models[^3] in R.
