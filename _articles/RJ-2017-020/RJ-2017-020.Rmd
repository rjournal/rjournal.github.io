title: Market Area Analysis for Retail and Service Locations with MCI
abstract: In retail location analysis, marketing research and spatial planning, the
  market areas of stores and/or locations are a frequent subject. Market area analyses
  consist of empirical observations and modeling via theoretical and/or econometric
  models such as the Huff Model or the Multiplicative Competitive Interaction Model.
  The authors’ package MCI implements the steps of market area analysis into R with
  a focus on fitting the models and data preparation and processing.
