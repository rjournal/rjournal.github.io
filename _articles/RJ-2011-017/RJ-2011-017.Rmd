title: Using the Google Visualisation API with R
abstract: The googleVis package provides an interface between R and the Google Visualisation
  API to create interactive charts which can be embedded into web pages. The best
  known of these charts is probably the Motion Chart, popularised by Hans Rosling
  in his TED talks. With the googleVis package users can easily create web pages with
  interactive charts based on R data frames and display them either via the local
  R HTTP help server or within their own sites.
