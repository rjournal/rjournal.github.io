title: Using the Google Visualisation API with R
abstract: The [*googleVis*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=googleVis) package
  provides an interface between R and the Google Visualisation API to create interactive
  charts which can be embedded into web pages. The best known of these charts is probably
  the Motion Chart, popularised by Hans Rosling in his TED talks. With the [*googleVis*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=googleVis)
  package users can easily create web pages with interactive charts based on R data
  frames and display them either via the local R HTTP help server or within their
  own sites.

# Motivation

In 2006 Hans Rosling gave an inspiring talk at TED[^1] about social and
economic developments in the world over the past 50 years, which
challenged the views and perceptions of many listeners. Rosling had used
extensive data analysis to reach his conclusions. To visualise his talk,
he and his colleagues at [Gapminder](http://www.gapminder.org) had
developed animated bubble charts, see Figure [1](#MotionChartGUI).

Rosling's presentation popularised the idea and use of interactive
charts, and as a result the software behind Gapminder was bought by
Google and integrated as motion charts into their [Visualisation
API](http://code.google.com/apis/visualization/documentation/index.html)[^2]
one year later.

In 2010 Sebastián Pérez Saaibi [@Saaibi2010] presented at the R/Rmetrics
Workshop on Computational Finance and Financial Engineering the idea to
use Google motion charts to visualise R output with the
[*rsp*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=rsp) package [@Rsp].

Inspired by those talks and the desire to use interactive data
visualisation tools to foster the dialogue between data analysts and
others, the authors of this article started the development of the
[*googleVis*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=googleVis)
package [@googleVis].

# Google Visualisation API

The Google Visualisation API allows users to create interactive charts
as part of Google documents, spreadsheets and web pages. This text will
focus on the usage of the API as part of web sites.

The [Google Public Data Explorer](http://www.google.com/publicdata/home)
(<http://www.google.com/publicdata/home>) provides a good example,
demonstrating the use of interactive charts and how they can help to
analyse data. The charting data can either be embedded into the html
file or read dynamically. The key to the Google Visualisation API is
that the data is structured in a
"[DataTable](http://code.google.com/apis/visualization/documentation/reference.html)",
and this is where the
[*googleVis*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=googleVis) package
helps. It uses the functionality of the
[*rjsonio*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=rjsonio)
package [@RJSONIO] to transform R data frames into
[JSON](http://www.json.org/)[^3] objects as the basis for a DataTable.

![Figure 1: Overview of a Google Motion Chart. Screenshot of the output
of plot(gvisMotionChart(Fruits, idvar = 'Fruit', timevar =
'Year'))](MotionChart.png){#MotionChartGUI width="100%" alt="graphic without alt text"}

As an example, we will look at the html code of a motion chart from
Google's visualisation
[gallery](http://code.google.com/apis/visualization/documentation/gallery/motionchart.html),
which generates output similar to Figure [1](#MotionChartGUI):

``` r
 1 <html>
 2 <head>
 3  <script type="text/javascript" 
 4    src="http://www.google.com/jsapi">
 5  </script>
 6  <script type="text/javascript">
 7    google.load('visualization', '1', 
 8     {'packages':['motionchart']});
 9   google.setOnLoadCallback(drawChart);
10   function drawChart() {
11   var data=new google.visualization.DataTable();
12   data.addColumn('string', 'Fruit');
13   data.addColumn('date', 'Date');
14   data.addColumn('number', 'Sales');
15   data.addColumn('number', 'Expenses');
16   data.addColumn('string', 'Location');
17   data.addRows([
18   ['Apples',new Date(1988,0,1),1000,300,'East'],
19   ['Oranges',new Date(1988,0,1),1150,200,'West'],
20   ['Bananas',new Date(1988,0,1),300,250,'West'],
21   ['Apples',new Date(1989,6,1),1200,400,'East'],
22   ['Oranges',new Date(1989,6,1),750,150,'West'],
23   ['Bananas',new Date(1989,6,1),788,617,'West']
24   ]);
25   var chart=new google.visualization.MotionChart(
26     document.getElementById('chart_div'));
27   chart.draw(data, {width: 600, height:300});
28  }
29  </script>
30 </head>
31 <body>
32 <div id="chart_div" 
33      style="width:600px; height:300px;">
34 </div>
35 </body>
36 </html>
```

The code and data are processed and rendered in the browser and is not
submitted to any server[^4].

You will notice that the above html code has five generic parts[^5]:

-   references to Google's AJAX (l. 4) and Visualisation API (ll. 7--8),

-   data to visualise as a DataTable (ll. 11--24),

-   an instance call to create the chart (ll. 25--26),

-   a method call to draw the chart including options, shown here as
    width and height (l. 27),

-   an HTML `<div>` element to add the chart to the page (ll. 32--34).

These principles hold true for most of the interactive charts of the
Google Visualisation API.

However, before you use the API you should read the [Google
Visualisation API Terms of
Service](http://code.google.com/apis/visualization/terms.html)[^6] and
the [Google Maps/Google Earth APIs Terms of
Service](http://code.google.com/apis/maps/terms.html)[^7].

# The [*googleVis*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=googleVis) package

The [*googleVis*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=googleVis) package
provides an interface between R and the Google Visualisation API. The
functions of the package allow the user to visualise data stored in R
data frames with the Google Visualisation API.

Version (0.2.12) of the package provides interfaces to Motion Charts,
Annotated Time Lines, Geo Maps, Maps, Geo Charts, Intensity Maps,
Tables, Gauges, and Tree Maps, as well as Line-, Bar-, Column-, Area-,
Combo-, Scatter-, Candlestick-, Pie- and Org Charts; see
Figure [2](#demos) for some examples.

The output of a
[*googleVis*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=googleVis) function is
html code that contains the data and references to JavaScript functions
hosted by Google. A browser with an Internet connection is required to
view the output, and for Motion Charts, Geo Maps and Annotated Time
Lines also Flash. The actual chart is rendered in the browser.

Please note that Flash charts may not work when loaded as a local file
due to security settings, and therefore may require to be displayed via
a web server. Fortunately, R comes with an internal HTTP server which
allows the [*googleVis*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=googleVis)
package to display pages locally. Other options are to use the
[*R.rsp*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=R.rsp) package or
RApache [@Rapache2011] with
[*brew*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=brew) [@brew2010]. Both
[*R.rsp*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=R.rsp) and
[*brew*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=brew) have the capability to
extract and execute R code from html code, similar to the approach taken
by Sweave [@Sweave2002] for LaTeX.

![Figure 2: Screenshot of some of the outputs of demo(googleVis).
Clockwise from top left: gvisMotionChart, gvisAnnotatedTimeLine,
gvisGeoMap, gvisTreeMap, gvisTable, and gvisMap.
](googleVisDemoPlots2.png){#demos width="100%" alt="graphic without alt text"}

The individual functions of the
[*googleVis*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=googleVis) package are
documented in detail in the help pages and package
[vignette](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/googleVis/vignettes/googleVis.pdf).
Here we will cover only the principles of the package.

As an example we will show how to generate a Motion Chart as displayed
in Figure [1](#MotionChartGUI). It works similarly for the other APIs.
Further examples are covered in the demos of the
[*googleVis*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=googleVis) package and
on the project Google Code site.

The design of the visualisation functions is fairly generic. The name of
the visualisation function is `’gvis’` followed by the chart type. Thus
for the Motion Chart we have:

``` r
gvisMotionChart(data, idvar = 'id', 
    timevar = 'date', options = list())
```

Here `data` is the input `data.frame` and the arguments `idvar` and
`timevar` specify the column names of the id variable and time variable
for the plot, while display options are set in an optional list. The
options and data requirements follow those of the Google Visualisation
API and are documented in the help pages, see `help(’gvisMotionChart’)`.

The output of a
[*googleVis*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=googleVis) function is
a list of lists (a nested list) containing information about the chart
type, chart id, and the html code in a sub-list split into header,
chart, caption and footer.

The idea behind this concept is that users get a complete web page while
at the same time they can extract only specific parts, such as the
chart. This is particularly helpful if the package functions are used in
solutions where the user wants to feed the visualisation output into
other sites, or would like to embed them into rsp-pages, or use RApache
or Google Gadgets.

The output of a
[*googleVis*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=googleVis) function
will be of class `"gvis"` and `"list"`. Generic print (`print.gvis`) and
plot (`plot.gvis`) methods exist to ease the handling of such objects.

To illustrate the concept we shall create a motion chart using the
`Fruits` data set.

## Motion chart example

Following the documentation of the Google Motion Chart API we need a
data set which has at least four columns: one identifying the variable
we would like to plot, one time variable, and at least two numerical
variables; further numerical and character columns are allowed.

As an example we use the `Fruits` data set:

``` r
R> data(Fruits)
R> Fruits[, -7] # ignore column 7

    Fruit Year Location Sales Expenses Profit 
1  Apples 2008     West    98       78     20 
2  Apples 2009     West   111       79     32
3  Apples 2010     West    89       76     13
4 Oranges 2008     East    96       81     15 
5 Bananas 2008     East    85       76      9 
6 Oranges 2009     East    93       80     13
7 Bananas 2009     East    94       78     16
8 Oranges 2010     East    98       91      7 
9 Bananas 2010     East    81       71     10
```

Here we will use the columns `’Fruit’` and `’Year’` as id and time
variable respectively.

``` r
R>  M <- gvisMotionChart(Fruits, idvar = "Fruit", 
                         timevar = "Year")
```

The structural output of `gvisMotionChart` is a list of lists as
described above:

``` r
R>  str(M)

List of 3
 $ type   : chr "MotionChart"
 $ chartid: chr "MotionChartID12ae2fff"
 $ html   :List of 4
  ..$ header : chr "<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC ...
  ..$ chart  : Named chr [1:7] "<!-- Moti ...
  .. ..- attr(*, "names")= chr [1:7] "jsH ...
  ..$ caption: chr "<div><span>Data: Fruit...
  ..$ footer : chr "\n<!-- htmlFooter -->\...
 - attr(*, "class")= chr [1:2] "gvis" "list"
```

The first two items of the list contain information about the chart type
used and the individual chart id. The html output is a list with header,
chart, caption and footer. This allows the user to extract only certain
parts of the page, or to create a complete html page.

The header part of the html page has only basic html and formatting tags
and provides a simple layout, see

``` r
R>  print(M, 'header')   # output not shown here
```

The actual Google visualisation code is stored with the data in the
named character vector `chart` of the html list, see

``` r
R>  print(M, 'chart')    # output not shown here
```

The sub-items of the chart object give the user more granular access to
JavaScript functions and html tags of the visualisation. A basic chart
caption and html footer complete the html list:

``` r
R>  print(M, 'caption')  # output not shown here
R>  print(M, 'footer')   # output not shown here
```

## Displaying \"gvis\" objects

To display the page locally, type:

``` r
R>  plot(M)     # returns invisibly the file name
```

The plot method for `"gvis"` objects creates html files in a temporary
folder using the type and chart id information of the object and it will
display the output using the R HTTP help web server locally. The R
command `tempdir()` shows the path of the per-session temporary
directory.

Further examples are part of the
[*googleVis*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=googleVis) demos,
including one showing how a Geo Map can be animated with additional
JavaScript, see `demo(package = "googleVis")`.

## Combing charts with gvisMerge

The function `gvisMerge` takes two `"gvis"` objects and merges the
underlying components into one page. The charts are aligned either
horizontally or vertically next to each other in an HTML table.

The output of `gvisMerge` is a `"gvis"` object again. This allows us to
apply the same function iteratively to create more complex chart
layouts. The following example, see Figure [3](#gvisMerge), aligns a Geo
Chart and Table below each other, and combines the output with a Motion
Chart to the right.

``` r
G <- gvisGeoChart(Exports, "Country", "Profit", 
         options = list(width = 200, height = 100))
T <- gvisTable(Exports, 
         options = list(width = 200, height = 270))
M <- gvisMotionChart(Fruits, "Fruit", "Year",
         options = list(width = 400, height = 370))
GT <- gvisMerge(G, T, horizontal = FALSE) 
GTM <- gvisMerge(GT, M, horizontal = TRUE, 
    tableOptions = 
    "bgcolor = \textbackslash"#CCCCCC\textbackslash" cellspacing = 10")
plot(GTM)
```

![Figure 3: Three charts combined with gvisMerge.
](gvisMerge.png){#gvisMerge width="100%" alt="graphic without alt text"}

## Embedding [*googleVis*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=googleVis) in web sites dynamically

With the R packages [*R.rsp*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=R.rsp)
and [*brew*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=brew) we have two
options to integrate R snippets into html code. While the
[*R.rsp*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=R.rsp) package comes with
its own internal web server,
[*brew*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=brew) requires the Apache
HTTP server with the RApache module installed.

Both packages allow the user to embed R code into html code. The R code
is filtered by the [*R.rsp*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=R.rsp)
or RApache web server and executed at run time. As an example, we can
insert the above motion chart into a page:

``` r
<html>
<body>
<% library(googleVis) %>
<% M <- gvisMotionChart(Fruits, idvar="Fruit", 
    timevar="Year") %> 
<%= M$html$chart %>
</body>
</html>
```

The syntax of [*R.rsp*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=R.rsp) and
[*brew*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=brew) are very similar. The
R code included in `<%`$\dots$`%>` is executed when read by the HTTP
server, but no R output will be displayed. To insert the R output into
the html code we have to add an equal sign, `<%=`$\dots$`%>`, which acts
as a `cat` statement. In the example above the chart code is embedded
into the html code.

Examples for both approaches are part of the
[*googleVis*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=googleVis) package. For
more information see the vignettes and help files of the packages.

# Summary

Combining R with the Google Visualisation API enables users to quickly
create powerful analysis tools, which can be shared online. The user
interface is easily accessible both to data and non-data analysts.

The "[Statistics Relating to Lloyd's](http://www.lloyds.com/stats)" site
(<http://www.lloyds.com/stats>) is an example where the functions of the
[*googleVis*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=googleVis) package were
used to create a data visualisation page. Further case studies and links
to alternative packages are available on the [project Google Code
site](http://code.google.com/p/google-motion-charts-with-r/)[^8].
