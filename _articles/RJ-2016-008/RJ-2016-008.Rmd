title: 'quickpsy: An R Package to Fit Psychometric Functions for Multiple Groups'
abstract: quickpsy is a package to parametrically fit psychometric functions. In comparison
  with previous R packages, quickpsy was built to easily fit and plot data for multiple
  groups. Here, we describe the standard parametric model used to fit psychometric
  functions and the standard estimation of its parameters using maximum likelihood.
  We also provide examples of usage of quickpsy, including how allowing the lapse
  rate to vary can sometimes eliminate the bias in parameter estimation, but not in
  general. Finally, we describe some implementation details, such as how to avoid
  the problems associated to round-off errors in the maximisation of the likelihood
  or the use of closures and non-standard evaluation functions.
