# Introduction

Regression splines constitute a popular approach for the nonparametric
estimation of regression functions though they are restricted to
continuous predictors as are smoothing splines (see e.g. `smooth.spline`
which is limited to one numeric predictor) and locally weighted
scatterplot smoothing (see `loess` which is limited to four numeric
predictors). However, it is not uncommon to encounter relationships
involving a mix of numeric and categorical predictors, and the
[*crs*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=crs) package implements a
regression spline framework for accomplishing this task.

The *crs* package implements the approaches described in
@MA_RACINE_YANG:2012 and @MA_RACINE:2011 when the option `kernel=TRUE`
is selected (default) as described below. The categorical predictors can
be handled in two ways, (i) using kernel weighting where the kernel
functions are tailored to the discrete support of the categorical
predictors [@RACINE_LI:2004], and (ii) using indicator basis functions.
The fundamental difference between these two approaches is that the use
of indicator basis functions consumes degrees of freedom via the number
of columns in the basis matrix, while kernel weighting does not. As
well, this package implements a range of related methods and provides
options that we hope will make it appealing for applied projects,
research, and pedagogical purposes alike.

Both semiparametric additive models and fully nonparametric models are
implemented. Data-driven methods can be used for selecting the spline
degree, number of segments/knots, and bandwidths: leave-one-out
cross-validation (`cv.func = "cv.ls"`) [@STONE:1974; @STONE:1977],
generalized cross-validation (`cv.func="cv.gcv"`) [@CRAVEN_WAHBA:1979],
and the information-based criterion (`cv.func="cv.aic"`) proposed by
@HURVICH_SIMONOFF_TSAI:1998. Derivatives of arbitrary order can readily
be constructed. One of the computational challenges encountered is to
obtain the optimal spline degree (non-negative integer), number of
segments/knots (positive integer), and bandwidth (bounded and
real-valued) for each predictor. We overcome this challenge by providing
an interface to NOMAD [@NOMAD; @LEDIGABEL:2011].

Before proceeding we briefly provide an overview of some important
implementation details:

1.  The degree of the spline and number of segments (i.e. knots minus
    one) for each continuous predictor can be set manually as can the
    bandwidths for each categorical predictor (if appropriate).

2.  Alternatively, any of the data-driven criteria (i.e. `cv.func="…"`)
    could be used to select either the degree of the spline (holding the
    number of segments/knots fixed at any user-set value) and bandwidths
    for the categorical predictors (if appropriate), or the number of
    segments (holding the degree of the spline fixed at any user-set
    value) and bandwidths for the categorical predictors (if
    appropriate), or the number of segments and the degree of the spline
    for each continuous predictor and bandwidths for each categorical
    predictor (if appropriate).

3.  When indicator basis functions are used instead of kernel smoothing,
    whether to include each categorical predictor or not can be
    specified manually or chosen via any `cv.func` method.

4.  We allow the degree of the spline for each continuous predictor to
    include zero, the inclusion indicator for each categorical predictor
    to equal zero, and the bandwidth for each categorical predictor to
    equal one, and when the degree/inclusion indicator is zero or the
    bandwidth is one, the variable is thereby removed from the
    regression: in this manner, irrelevant predictors can be
    automatically removed by any `cv.func` method negating the need for
    pre-testing (mirroring findings detailed in @HALL_RACINE_LI:2004
    [@HALL_LI_RACINE:2007] for kernel regression).

The design philosophy underlying the *crs* package aims to closely mimic
the behaviour of the `lm` function. Indeed, the implementation relies on
`lm` and its supporting functions for computation of the spline
coefficients, delete-one residuals, fitted values, prediction and the
like. 95% confidence bounds for the fit and derivatives are constructed
from asymptotic formulae and automatically generated. Below we describe
in more detail the specifics of the implementation for the interested
reader. Others may wish to jump to the illustrative example that appears
towards the end of this article or simply install and load the package
and run `example(crs)`.

## Differences between existing spline methods and those in the *crs* package

Readers familiar with existing R-functions and packages for spline
modelling will naturally be wondering what the difference is between the
*crs* package and existing spline-based procedures such as

-   `smooth.spline` in R base

-   `spm` in the [*SemiPar*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=SemiPar)
    package [@SemiPar]

-   `gam` in the [*mgcv*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=mgcv)
    package [@WOOD:2006]

-   `ssanova` in the [*gss*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=gss)
    package [@gss]

-   `gam` in the [*gam*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=gam) package
    [@gam]

First we note that the functions `smooth.spline` and `ssanova` are based
on smoothing spline methodology, while `spm` uses penalized splines but
`gam` in the *gam*/*mgcv* packages allows for smoothing splines,
penalized splines, and regression splines. The *crs* package is
restricted to 'regression splines' which differs in a number of ways
from 'smoothing splines' and 'penalized splines', the fundamental
difference being that smoothing/penalized splines use the data points
themselves as potential knots and penalize 'roughness' (typically the
second derivative of the estimate) while regression splines place knots
at equidistant/equiquantile points and do not explicitly penalize
roughness, rather, they rely on various cross-validatory approaches for
model selection. We direct the interested reader to @WAHBA:1990 for a
treatment of smoothing splines. The *crs* package is one of the few
packages devoted to regression spline techniques. We also provide
quantile regression splines via the option `tau=`$\tau$
($\tau\in(0,1)$).

Second, many of the aforementioned smoothing spline implementations are
semiparametric in nature, the semiparametric additive model being
particularly popular. Though semiparametric models exist to circumvent
the curse of dimensionality, it does not come without cost. That is, the
burden of determining whether semiparametric or nonparametric approaches
would be warranted in any given situation is placed squarely on the
researcher's shoulder. Unlike many existing spline methods in R, the
implementation in the *crs* package is designed so that every parameter
that must be chosen by the researcher can be data-driven (via
cross-validation) so that such choices adapt to the data at hand
*including* whether to use a semiparametric or nonparametric model. This
is accomplished using options such as `basis="auto"`, `knots="auto"`,
and `complexity="degree-knots"` (`basis="auto"` deciding whether to use
an additive basis or tensor product basis in multivariate settings,
`knots="auto"` whether to use equispaced knots or quantile knots, and
`complexity="degree-knots"` determining both the spline degrees and
number of knots).

Generally speaking, almost all of these existing smoothing spline
approaches can handle mixed datatypes though their approaches to the
treatment of categorical variables often differ (none use categorical
kernel smoothing as in the *crs* package).

## The underlying model

Regression spline methods can be limited in their potential
applicability as they are based on *continuous* predictors. However, in
applied settings we often encounter *categorical* predictors such as
strength of preference ("strongly prefer", "weakly prefer",
"indifferent") and so forth.

We wish to model the unknown conditional mean in the following
location-scale model,
$$Y=g\left( \mathbf{X},\mathbf{Z}\right) +\sigma \left( \mathbf{X},\mathbf{Z}
  \right) \varepsilon,$$ where $g(\cdot )$ is an unknown function,
$\mathbf{X=}\left(
X_{1},\ldots ,X_{q}\right) ^{\mathrm{T}}$ is a $q$-dimensional vector of
continuous predictors, $\mathbf{Z}=\left( Z_{1},\ldots
,Z_{r}\right) ^{\mathrm{T}}$ is an $r$-dimensional vector of categorical
predictors, and $\sigma^2\left(\mathbf{X},\mathbf{Z}\right)$ is the
conditional variance of $Y$ given $\mathbf{X}$ and $\mathbf{Z}$. Letting
$\mathbf{z} =\left( z_{s}\right) _{s=1}^{r}$, we assume that $z_{s}$
takes $c_{s}$ different values in $D_{s}\equiv \left\{ 0,1,\ldots
,c_{s}-1\right\}$, $s=1,\ldots ,r$, and $c_{s}$ is a finite positive
constant.

For the continuous predictors the regression spline model employs the
B-spline routines in the GNU Scientific Library [@gsl]. The B-spline
function is the maximally differentiable interpolative basis function
(B-spline stands for 'basis-spline').

Heuristically, we conduct linear (in parameter) regression using the R
function `lm`, however, we replace the continuous predictors with
B-splines of potentially differing order and number of segments for each
continuous predictor. For the tensor product bases we set
`intercept=TRUE` for each univariate spline basis, while for the
additive spline bases we adopt the `intercept=FALSE` variants and
include an intercept term in the model (the B-splines will therefore not
sum to one, i.e. an order $m$ B-spline with one segment (two
knots/breakpoints) has $m+1$ columns and we drop the first as is often
done, though see @ZHOU_WOLFE:2000 for an alternative approach based upon
shrinkage methods). This allows multiple bases to coexist when there is
more than one continuous predictor. The tensor product basis is given by
$$B_1\otimes B_2\otimes \dots \otimes B_p,$$ where $\otimes$ is the
Kronecker product where the products operate column-wise and $B_j$ is
the basis matrix for predictor $j$ as outlined above. We also support a
'generalized' polynomial B-spline basis that consists of a varying-order
polynomial with appropriate interactions. When additive B-spline bases
are employed we have a semiparametric 'additive' spline model (no
interaction among variables unless explicitly specified). When the
tensor product or generalized polynomial is employed we have a fully
nonparametric model (interaction among all variables). Whether to use
the additive, tensor product, or generalized polynomial bases can be
pre-specified or automatically determined via any `cv.func` method (see
the options for `basis=` in `?crs`).

We offer the default option to use categorical kernel weighting
(`lm(…,weights=L)`) to handle the presence of categorical predictors
(see below for a description of `L`). We also offer the option of using
indicator basis functions for the categorical predictors.

## Weighted least-squares estimation of the underlying model

The unknown function $g\left( \mathbf{X},\mathbf{Z}\right)$ can be
approximated by $\mathcal{B}\left( \mathbf{X}\right)
^{\mathrm{T}}\beta \left( \mathbf{Z}\right)$, where $\beta \left(
  \mathbf{Z}\right)$ is a vector of coefficients and
$\mathcal{B}\left( \mathbf{X}\right)$ the B-spline basis matrix
described above.

We estimate $\beta \left( \mathbf{z}\right)$ by minimizing the following
weighted least squares criterion,
$$\widehat{\beta }\left( \mathbf{z}\right) =\mathop{\mathrm{arg\!min}}_{\beta \left( \mathbf{z}
    \right) \in \mathbb{R}^{\mathbf{K}_{n}}}\sum\limits_{i=1}^{n}\left\{ Y_{i}-
    \mathcal{B}\left( \mathbf{X}_{i}\right) ^{\mathrm{T}}\beta \left( \mathbf{z}\right) \right\} ^{2}L\left( \mathbf{Z}_{i},\mathbf{z},\lambda\right).$$

## Placement of knots

The user can determine where knots are to be placed using one of two
methods:

1.  knots can be placed at equally spaced quantiles whereby an equal
    number of observations lie in each segment ('quantile knots').

2.  knots can be placed at equally spaced intervals ('uniform knots').

If preferred, this can be determined automatically using the option
`knots="auto"`.

## Kernel weighting

Let $Z_i$ be an $r$-dimensional vector of categorical/discrete
predictors. We use $z_s$ to denote the $s$-th component of $z$, we
assume that $z_s$ takes $c_s$ different values in $D_s
\equiv \{0,1,\dots ,c_s-1\}$, $s=1,\dots,r$, and let $c_s\geq 2$ be a
finite positive constant.

For an unordered categorical predictor, we use a variant of the kernel
function outlined in @AITCHISON_AITKEN:1976 defined as
$$\label{eq:barL(new)}
  l( Z_{is}, z_{s},\lambda_s) =
  \left\{ \begin{array}{ll} 1, & \text{ when $ Z_{is} = z_s$},\\
      \lambda_s, &  \text{  otherwise}.
    \end{array}  \right.  (\#eq:barL(new))  $$ Let ${\bf 1}(A)$ denote
the usual indicator function, which assumes the value one if $A$ holds
true, zero otherwise. Using \@ref(eq:barL(new)), we can construct a
product kernel weight function given by
$$L\left( \mathbf{Z}_{i},\mathbf{z},\lambda\right) = \prod_{s=1}^r l( Z_{is},z_s,\lambda_s) =
  \prod_{s=1}^{r} \lambda_s^{ {\bf 1}( Z_{is} \neq z_s) },$$ while for
an ordered categorical we use the function defined by
$$\tilde l(Z_{is},z_s,\lambda_s) = \lambda_s^{|Z_{is}-z_s| }$$ and
modify the product kernel function appropriately. When $Z$ contains a
mix of ordered and unordered variables we select the appropriate kernel
for each variable's type when constructing the product kernel
$L\left( \mathbf{Z}_{i},\mathbf{z},\lambda\right)$.

Note that when $\lambda_s=1$ all observations are 'pooled' over
categorical predictor $s$ hence the variable $z_s$ is removed from the
resulting estimate, while when $\lambda_s=0$ only observations lying in
a given cell are used to form the estimate.

## Additional estimation details

Estimating the model requires construction of the spline bases and their
tensor product (if specified) along with the categorical kernel
weighting function. Then, for a given degree and number of segments for
each continuous predictor and bandwidth for each categorical predictor
(or indicator bases if `kernel=FALSE`), the model is fit via
least-squares.

All smoothing parameters can be set manually by the user if so desired,
however be forewarned that you must use the option `cv="none"` otherwise
the values specified manually will become the starting points for search
when `cv="nomad"` ('nonsmooth mesh adaptive direct search (NOMAD)', see
@NOMAD and @LEDIGABEL:2011). Currently, we provide a simple R interface
to NOMAD (see the section below) in the *crs* package which also can be
applied to solve other mixed integer optimization problems.

The degree, segment, and bandwidth vectors can be jointly determined via
any `cv.func` method by setting the option `cv="nomad"` or
`cv="exhaustive"` (exhaustive search). Here we have to solve nonlinear
non-convex and non-differentiable mixed integer constrained optimization
problems to obtain the optimal degree, number of segments, and bandwidth
for each predictor.

Setting the option `cv="nomad"` (default) computes NOMAD-based
cross-validation directed search while setting `cv="exhaustive"`
computes exhaustive cross-validation directed search for each unique
combination of the degree and segment vector for each continuous
predictor from `degree=degree.min` through `degree=degree.max` (default
0 and 10, respectively) and from `segments=segments.min` through
`segments=segments.max` (default 1 and 10, respectively).

When `kernel=TRUE` (default) setting the option `cv="exhaustive"`
computes bandwidths ($\in[0,1]$) obtained via numerical minimization
(using `optim`) for each unique combination of the degree and segment
vectors (restarting can be conducted via `restarts=`). When setting
`cv="nomad"` the number of multiple starts can be controlled by
`nmulti=` (default is 5). The model possessing the lowest criterion
function value over the `nmulti` restarts is then selected as the final
model.

Note that `cv="exhaustive"` is often unfeasible (this combinatoric
problem can become impossibly large to compute in finite time) hence
`cv="nomad"` is the default. However, with `cv="nomad"` one should set
`nmulti=` to some sensible value greater than zero to avoid becoming
trapped in local minima (default `nmulti=5`).

## Data-driven smoothing parameter criteria

We incorporate three popular approaches for setting the smoothing
parameters of the regression spline model, namely least-squares
cross-validation, generalized cross-validation, and an AIC method
corrected for use in nonparametric settings.

Let the fitted value from the regression spline model be denoted $\hat
Y_i=B_{m}(X_i)^T\hat \beta(Z_i)$. Letting $\hat\varepsilon_i=Y_i-\hat
Y_i$ denote the $i$th residual from the categorical regression spline
model, the least-squares cross-validation function is given by
$$CV=\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^n\frac{\hat\varepsilon_i^2}{(1-h_{ii})^2}$$
and this computation can be done with effectively one pass through the
data set, where $h_{ii}$ denotes the $i$th diagonal element of the
spline basis projection matrix (see below for details). Since $h_{ii}$
is computed routinely for robust diagnostics in R, this can be computed
along with (and hence as cheaply as) the vector of spline coefficients
themselves. Thus least-squares cross-validation is computationally
appealing, particularly for large data sets.

Let $H$ denote the $n\times n$ weighting matrix such that $\hat Y=HY$
with its $i$th diagonal element given by $H_{ii}$ where $\text{tr}(H)$
means the trace of $H$ which is equal to $\sum_{i=1}^n h_{ii}$. The
matrix $H$ is often called the 'hat matrix' or 'smoother matrix' and
depends on $X$ but not on $Y$. The 'generalized' cross-validation
function is obtained by replacing $h_{ii}$ in the above formula with its
average value denoted $\text{tr}(H)/n$ [@CRAVEN_WAHBA:1979].

The information-based criterion proposed by @HURVICH_SIMONOFF_TSAI:1998
is given by $$\text{AIC}_c=\ln(\hat\sigma^2)+
  \frac{1+\text{tr}(H)/n}{1-\{\text{tr}(H)+2\}/n}$$ where
$$\hat\sigma^2=\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^n\hat\varepsilon_i^2
  =Y'(I-H)'(I-H)Y/n.$$ Each of these criterion functions can be
minimized with respect to the unknown smoothing parameters either by
numerical optimization procedures or by exhaustive search.

Though each of the above criteria are asymptotically equivalent in terms
of the bandwidths they deliver ($\text{tr}(H)/n\to 0$ as $n\to\infty$),
they may differ in finite-sample settings for a small smoothing
parameter (large $\text{tr}(H)/n$) with the AIC$_c$ criterion penalizing
more heavily when undersmoothing than either the least-squares
cross-validation or generalized cross-validation criteria (the AIC$_c$
criterion effectively applies an infinite penalty for
$\text{tr}(H)/n\ge 1/2$).

## Pruning

Once a model has been selected via cross-validation (i.e. `degree`,
`segments`, `include` or `lambda` have been selected), there is the
opportunity to (potentially) further refine the model by adding the
option `prune=TRUE` to the `crs` function call. Pruning is accomplished
by conducting stepwise cross-validated variable selection using a
modified version of the `stepAIC` function in the R
[*MASS*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=MASS) package where the
function `extractAIC` is replaced with the function `extractCV` with
additional modifications where necessary. Pruning of potentially
superfluous bases is undertaken, however, the pruned model (potentially
containing a subset of the bases) is returned *only if its
cross-validation score improves upon the model being pruned*. When this
is not the case a warning is issued to this effect. A final pruning
stage is commonplace in spline frameworks and may positively impact on
the finite-sample efficiency of the resulting estimator depending on the
rank of the model being pruned. Note that this option can only be
applied when `kernel=FALSE` (or when there exist only numeric
predictors).

# A simple R interface to NOMAD {#section:nomad}

The *crs* package has included a simple R interface to the NOMAD
optimization solver called `snomadr`. `snomadr` implements the NOMAD
library which is an open source C++ implementation of the Mesh Adaptive
Direct Search (MADS) algorithm designed for constrained optimization of
blackbox functions [@NOMAD; @LEDIGABEL:2011]. `snomadr` can be seen as a
standalone interface to this optimization solver, though we would like
to point out that the authors of `NOMAD` are currently working on an R
package for NOMAD that we expect to be much more comprehensive than the
simple interface provided here. The principle behind developing our
interface is simply to shield the user from setting up the optimization
model underlying our regression spline implementation. For what follows
we will not discuss the performance of the solver NOMAD, rather we
direct the interested reader to @NOMAD [@LEDIGABEL:2011] and the
references therein.

The structure of the `snomadr` interface is similar to the interface in
the R package *ipoptr* (<http://www.ucl.ac.uk/~uctpjyy/ipoptr.html>)
which exports the R interface to the optimization solver IPOPT [@ipopt].
The interface is split into two major portions, one is the R code called
`snomadr.R` and another is a C++ program called `snomadr.cpp`. The role
of `snomadr.R` is to set up the optimization model, define options and
then call the C++ code to solve the optimization problem. `snomadr.cpp`
will receive arguments from the R code and then call the NOMAD library
functions to solve the problem and return results to `snomadr.R`.
`.Call` is used to transfer arguments and results between the R and C++
languages. For further details see `?snomadr`.

# Illustrative example

By way of illustration we consider a simple simulated example involving
one continuous and one categorical predictor.

``` r
set.seed(42)
n <- 1000
x <- runif(n)
z <- rbinom(n, 1, .5)
y <- cos(2 * pi * x) + z + rnorm(n, sd=0.25)
z <- factor(z)
model <- crs(y ~ x + z)
summary(model)

Call:
crs.formula(formula = y ~ x + z)

The function `crs()` called in this example returns a `"crs"` object.
The generic functions `fitted` and `residuals` extract (or generate)
estimated values and residuals. Furthermore, the functions `summary`,
`predict`, and `plot` (options `mean=FALSE`, `deriv=`$i$, `ci=FALSE`,
`plot.behavior` = `c("plot"`, `"plot-data"`, `"data")`, where $i$ is a
positive integer) support objects of this type.

Figure [1](#fig:OneCategoricalOneContinuous) presents summary output in
the form of partial regression surfaces (predictors not appearing on the
axes are held constant at their medians/modes). Note that for this
simple example we used the option `plot(model,mean=TRUE)` which presents
'partial regression plots'.[^1]

Next we plot the first partial derivative (which plots the partial
derivative with respect to the continuous predictor holding the
categorical predictor at its modal value and next the difference between
the regression function when the categorical predictor equals 0 and 1
holding the continuous predictor at its median) for this model in Figure
[2](#fig:OneCategoricalOneContinuousDeriv). Note that here we used the
option `plot(model, deriv=1)`.

# Comparison with existing spline methods

We now compare and contrast some existing spline implementations in R
with the regression spline implementation contained in the *crs* package
via two illustrative Monte Carlo simulations.

## The bivariate one continuous predictor case

We first consider the simple and popular case of nonparametrically
modeling the relationship between a response $Y$ and univariate
predictor $X$. Here the purpose is to help the reader assess the
performance of regression splines versus smoothing splines. We consider
four data generating processes (DGPs), the sine and cosine functions,
the absolute value function, and the Doppler function given by
$$g(x)=\sqrt{x(1-x)}\times\sin\left(\frac{2\pi(1+2^{-7/5})}{x+2^{-7/5}}\right)$$
For the sine, cosine, and Doppler functions $X$ is $U[0,1]$, while for
the absolute value function $X$ is $U[-1,1]$. We vary the signal/noise
ratio by standardizing the DGP to have mean zero and unit variance and
setting $\sigma$ for the Gaussian noise to $1/4,1/2,1,2$ which produces
expected in-sample fits of $R^2=0.95,0.80,0.50,0.20$ for the oracle
estimator (i.e. one that uses knowledge of the DGP).

We compare `crs`-based regression splines with smoothing spline methods
`gam` in the *mgcv* package, `spm` in the *SemiPar* package, `ssanova`
in the *gss* package, and `loess` in base R. All methods in this first
simulation use default settings.

We draw $M=1,000$ replications of size $n=1,000$ from each DGP, compute
the mean square error (MSE) for each model, and report the median value
of each model's MSE relative to that for `crs` over the $M=1,000$
replications in Table [1](#uni-mc-table) below (numbers less than one
indicate that a method is more efficient than `crs`).

  : Table 1: MSE efficiency of the various methods relative to `crs`
  (numbers less than one indicate more efficient than `crs`).
:::

Table [1](#uni-mc-table) reveals some general patterns. For smooth low
frequency DGPs such as the sine and cosine, `gam`, `spm`, and `ssanova`
turn in similar performances depending on the signal/noise ratio.
However, `loess` does not do well with these DGPs. For the absolute
value and Doppler DGPs `gam`, `spm`, `ssanova` and `loess` on balance
perform worse than `crs`. From a minimax perspective, the regression
spline implementation in the *crs* package performs relatively well
overall. Naturally by modifying tuning parameters one could expect to
improve the performance of the smoothing spline methods (this would
apply to `crs` as well as default settings are used throughout). The
point to be made is simply that the regression spline implementation in
*crs* appears to adapt fairly well to the underlying DGP and may
therefore be of interest to readers.

## The multivariate case, mixed predictor types

Next we consider mixed predictor multivariate DGPs with additive and
multiplicative features. The additive DGP is of the form

``` r
x1 <- runif(n)
x2 <- runif(n)
z <- rbinom(n, 1, .5)
dgp <- cos(2*pi*x1) + sin(2*pi*x2) + z
dgp <- (dgp - mean(dgp))/sd(dgp)
y <- dgp + rnorm(n, sd=sigma)
z <- factor(z)
```

while the multiplicative DGPs are of the form

``` r
x1 <- runif(n)
x2 <- runif(n)
z <- rbinom(n, 1, .5)
dgp <- cos(2*pi*x1) * sin(2*pi*x2) * z
dgp <- (dgp - mean(dgp))/sd(dgp)
y <- dgp + rnorm(n, sd=sigma)
z <- factor(z)
```

and the radial function given by

``` r
x1 <- runif(n, -5, 5)
x2 <- runif(n, -5, 5)
z <- rbinom(n, 1, .5)
dgp <- sin(sqrt(x1^2 + x2^2 + z))/
       sqrt(x1^2 + x2^2 + z)
dgp <- (dgp - mean(dgp))/sd(dgp)
y <- dgp + rnorm(n, sd=sigma)
z <- factor(z)
```

We again vary the signal/noise ratio by standardizing the DGP and
setting $\sigma$ for the Gaussian noise to $1/4,1/2,1,2$ which produces
expected in-sample fits of $R^2=0.95,0.80,0.50,0.20$ for the oracle
estimator (i.e. one that uses knowledge of the DGP). We estimate the
following eight models,

``` r
model <- crs(y ~ x1 + x2 + z)
# gam (mgcv) additive
model <- gam(y ~ s(x1) + s(x2) + z)
# gam (mgcv) tensor to admit interactions
model <- gam(y ~ t2(x1, x2, k=k) + z)
# gam (mgcv) tensor with smooth for every z
model <- gam(y ~ t2(x1, x2, k=k, by=z) + z)
# spm (SemiPar) additive
model <- spm(y ~ f(x1) + f(x2) + z)
# spm (SemiPar) tensor product
model <- spm(y ~ f(x1, x2) + z)
# ssanova (gss) additive
model <- ssanova(y ~ x1 + x2 + z)
# ssanova (gss) tensor product
model <- ssanova(y ~ x1 * x2 + z)
```

We draw $M=1000$ replications of size $n=1000$ from each DGP, compute
the MSE for each model, and report the median value of each model's MSE
relative to that for `crs` over the $M$ replications in Table
[2](#mctable) below.

  : Table 2: MSE efficiency of the various methods relative to `crs`
  (numbers less than one indicate more efficient than `crs`).
:::

For the *mgcv* routine `gam`, a referee noted that `?choose.k` could be
consulted where it suggests using `gam.check()` to help guide the
appropriate number of knots and suggested non-stochastic values of `k=5`
for the additive DGP with $2\pi$ and `k=10` for the remaining DGPs
(these values were used in Table [2](#mctable) for `gam` via the
argument `k=k` rather than the default values, while `crs` uses
stochastic values for the basis and all smoothing parameters).

When the DGP is additive, it is clear that the smoothing splines that
presume additivity are more efficient than `crs` for this DGP. Note that
this is an oracle type of property in the sense that the user does not
in general have knowledge of the true DGP, but if they did and used this
information their model would naturally be more efficient than a method
that did not (we elaborate further on this below). The regression spline
implementation in the *crs* package does not presume this knowledge when
`basis="auto"` is used (the default) though it allows for the
possibility. However, were one to use the incorrect smoothing spline
model when the DGP is additive (e.g. assume interaction when it is not
present), one could do worse than `crs` as can be seen in Table
[2](#mctable). But note that when the DGP is non-additive, `crs` appears
to be more efficient than the smoothing spline approaches even when they
employ, say, tensor basis functions to model the non-additive
relationship and are adapted to admit the presence of the binary factor
predictor (except `gam` which, as noted above, uses a number of knots
`k` that is optimized for these DGPs, rather than the defaults which
were used for all other methods). From a minimax perspective, the
regression spline implementation in the *crs* package performs
relatively well overall. Apart from selecting the number of knots for
`gam` as described above, default settings were used throughout and
therefore it is likely that efficiency could be improved in some cases
by further tuning (this would apply to `crs` as well, naturally).

To elaborate further on the issue of tuning and efficiency, if instead
of using defaults for `crs` we were to assume additivity as done for its
peers in columns 2, 5, and 7 in Table [2](#mctable) (options
`basis="additive"`, `kernel=FALSE`), then for the additive DGP in Table
[2](#mctable) the first row would instead be 0.94, 2.43, 3.29, 1.00,
2.69, 0.98, and 1.08, and we observe that the efficiency of `crs`
improves substantially even when using a stochastic choice of the
B-spline degree and number of knots, while the other methods use
non-stochastic choices for the number of knots that are constant over
all $M=1,000$ Monte Carlo replications. And if we followed the lead of
the anonymous referee who kindly suggested using non-stochastic values
for the number of knots (i.e. `k=5`) for `gam` in *mgcv* based on
replications from the additive DGP used for row 1 of Table
[2](#mctable), we might choose non-stochastic values `degree=c(4,4)` and
`segments=c(3,3)` based on cross-validation and the first row of Table
[2](#mctable) would instead be 1.18, 3.09, 4.19, 1.25, 3.42, 1.22, and
1.36. Furthermore, if in addition we used the option `prune=TRUE`
enabling post-estimation pruning of the model, the first row of Table
[2](#mctable) would instead be 1.48, 3.91, 5.35, 1.59, 4.28, 1.53, and
1.72 (note that this can only be used in conjunction with the option
`kernel=FALSE`). The point to be made is that indeed efficiency can be
improved in some cases by tuning of smoothing parameters and choice of
the basis, and this also holds for `crs` itself.

# Demos, data, and additional information

There exist a range of demonstrations available via `demo()` including

1.  `radial_persp`: R code for fitting and plotting a 3D perspective
    plot for the 'radial' function.

2.  `radial_rgl`: R code for fitting and generating a 3D real-time
    rendering plot for the 'radial' function using OpenGL (requires the
    [*rgl*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=rgl) package [@rgl]).

3.  `sine_rgl`: R code for fitting and generating a 3D real-time
    rendering plot for a product sine function using OpenGL.

4.  `radial_constrained_mean`: R code for constrained radial function
    estimation.

5.  `cqrs.R`: R code for fitting and plotting quantile regression
    splines.

There exist a number of datasets including

1.  `cps71`: Canadian cross-section wage data consisting of a random
    sample taken from the 1971 Canadian Census Public Use Tapes for male
    individuals having common education (grade 13). There are 205
    observations in total (contributed by Aman Ullah).

2.  `Engel95`: British cross-section data consisting of a random sample
    taken from the British Family Expenditure Survey for 1995. The
    households consist of married couples with an employed
    head-of-household between the ages of 25 and 55 years. There are
    1655 household-level observations in total (contributed by Richard
    Blundell).

3.  `wage1`: Cross-section wage data consisting of a random sample taken
    from the U.S. Current Population Survey for the year 1976. There are
    526 observations in total (contributed by Jeffrey Wooldridge).

We have tried to overload the `crs` method and associated S3 `plot`
method to accommodate the needs of a range of users and to automate a
number of routine tasks. Warning messages are produced where possible to
guide the user towards the most appropriate choice of settings. User
specified weights can be provided to allow for weighted least squares
and weighted cross-validation. In addition, we have a function `crsiv`
that implements instrumental variable regression splines that may be of
interest to some users (see `?crsiv` for details). Furthermore, quantile
regression splines are supported by setting `tau=` a scalar in the range
$(0,1)$. Finally, we would like to direct the reader to the vignettes
`crs`, `crs_faq`, and `spline_primer` for further examples, frequently
asked questions, and background information.

    versus one predictor $x_j$ when all other predictors are held
    constant at their respective medians/modes (this can be changed by
    the user).
