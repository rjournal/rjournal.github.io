title: 'The crs Package: Nonparametric Regression Splines for Continuous and Categorical
  Predictors'
abstract: A new package crs is introduced for computing nonparametric regression (and
  quantile) splines in the presence of both continuous and categorical predictors.
  B-splines are employed in the regression model for the continuous predictors and
  kernel weighting is employed for the categorical predictors. We also develop a simple
  R interface to NOMAD, which is a mixed integer optimization solver used to compute
  optimal regression spline solutions.
