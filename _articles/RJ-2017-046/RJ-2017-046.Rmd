title: Visualization of Regression Models Using visreg
abstract: Regression models allow one to isolate the relationship between the outcome
  and an ex planatory variable while the other variables are held constant. Here,
  we introduce an R package, visreg, for the convenient visualization of this relationship
  via short, simple function calls. In addition to estimates of this relationship,
  the package also provides pointwise confidence bands and partial residuals to allow
  assessment of variability as well as outliers and other deviations from modeling
  assumptions. The package provides several options for visualizing models with interactions,
  including lattice plots, contour plots, and both static and interactive perspective
  plots. The implementation of the package is designed to be fully object-oriented
  and interface seamlessly with Râ€™s rich collection of model classes, allowing a consistent
  interface for visualizing not only linear models, but generalized linear models,
  proportional hazards models, generalized additive models, robust regression models,
  and many more.
