title: 'queueing: A Package For Analysis Of Queueing Networks and Models in R'
abstract: queueing is a package that solves and provides the main performance measures
  for both basic Markovian queueing models and single and multiclass product-form
  queueing networks. It can be used both in education and for professional purposes.
  It provides an intuitive, straightforward way to build queueing models using S3
  methods. The package solves Markovian models of the form M/M/c/K/M/FCFS, open and
  closed single class Jackson networks, open and closed multiclass networks and mixed
  networks. Markovian models are used when both the customer inter-arrival time and
  the server processing time are exponentially distributed. Queueing network solvers
  are useful for modelling situations in which more than one station must be visited.
