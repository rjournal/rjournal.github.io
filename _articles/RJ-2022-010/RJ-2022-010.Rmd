title: Revisiting Historical Bar Graphics on Epidemics in the Era of R ggplot2
abstract: ' This study is motivated by an article published in a local history magazine
  on "Pandemics in the History". That article was also motivated by a government report
  involving several statistical graphics which were drawn by hand in 1938 and used
  to summarize official statistics on epidemics occurred between the years 1923 and
  1937. Due to the aesthetic information design available on these historical graphs,
  in this study, we would like to investigate how graphical elements of the graphs
  such as titles, axis lines, axis tick marks, tick mark labels, colors, and data
  values are presented on these graphics and how to reproduce these historical graphics
  via well-known data visualization package [ggplot2](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=ggplot2)
  in our era. '
