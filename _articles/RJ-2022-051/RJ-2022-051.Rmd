title: Log Likelihood Ratios for Common Statistical Tests Using the likelihoodR Package
abstract: ' The **likelihoodR** package has been developed to allow users to obtain
  statistics according to the likelihood approach to statistical inference. Commonly
  used tests are available in the package, such as: *t* tests, ANOVA, correlation,
  regression and a range of categorical analyses. In addition, there is a sample size
  calculator for *t* tests, based upon the concepts of strength of evidence, and the
  probabilities of misleading and weak evidence. '
