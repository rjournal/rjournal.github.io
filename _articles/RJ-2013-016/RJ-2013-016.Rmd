title: 'beadarrayFilter: An R Package to Filter Beads'
abstract: Microarrays enable the expression levels of thousands of genes to be measured
  simultane ously. However, only a small fraction of these genes are expected to be
  expressed under different experimental conditions. Nowadays, filtering has been
  introduced as a step in the microarray pre processing pipeline. Gene filtering aims
  at reducing the dimensionality of data by filtering redundant features prior to
  the actual statistical analysis. Previous filtering methods focus on the Affymetrix
  platform and can not be easily ported to the Illumina platform. As such, we developed
  a filtering method for Illumina bead arrays. We developed an R package, beadarrayFilter,
  to implement the latter method. In this paper, the main functions in the package
  are highlighted and using many examples, we illustrate how beadarrayFilter can be
  used to filter bead arrays.
