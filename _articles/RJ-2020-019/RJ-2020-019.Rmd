title: Skew-t Expected Information Matrix Evaluation and Use for Standard Error Calculations
abstract: Skew-t distributions derived from skew-normal distributions, as developed
  by Azzalini and several co-workers, are popular because of their theoretical foundation
  and the availability of computational methods in the R package sn. One difficulty
  with this skew-t family is that the elements of the expected information matrix
  do not have closed form analytic formulas. Thus, we developed a numerical integration
  method of computing the expected information matrix in the R package skewtInfo.
  The accuracy of our expected information matrix calculation method was confirmed
  by comparing the result with that obtained using an observed information matrix
  for a very large sample size. A Monte Carlo study to evaluate the accuracy of the
  standard errors obtained with our expected information matrix calculation method,
  for the case of three realistic skew-t parameter vectors, indicates that use of
  the expected information matrix results in standard errors as accurate as, and sometimes
  a little more accurate than, use of an observed information matrix.
