title: Bayesian Regression Models for Interval-censored Data in R
abstract: The package icenReg provides classic survival regression models for interval-censored
  data. We present an update to the package that extends the parametric models into
  the Bayesian framework. Core additions include functionality to define the regression
  model with the standard regression syntax while providing a custom prior function.
  Several other utility functions are presented that allow for simplified examination
  of the posterior distribution.
