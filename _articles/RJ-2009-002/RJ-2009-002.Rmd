title: 'EMD: A Package for Empirical Mode Decomposition and Hilbert Spectrum'
abstract: The concept of empirical mode decomposition (EMD) and the Hilbert spectrum
  (HS) has been developed rapidly in many disciplines of science and engineering since
  Huang et al. (1998) invented EMD. The key feature of EMD is to decompose a signal
  into so-called intrinsic mode function (IMF). Furthermore, the Hilbert spectral
  analysis of intrinsic mode functions provides frequency information evolving with
  time and quantifies the amount of variation due to oscillation at different time
  scales and time locations. In this article, we introduce an R package called EMD
  (Kim and Oh, 2008) that performs oneand twodimensional EMD and HS.
