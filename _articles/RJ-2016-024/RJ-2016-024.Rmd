title: 'statmod: Probability Calculations for the Inverse Gaussian Distribution'
abstract: The inverse Gaussian distribution (IGD) is a well known and often used probability
  dis tribution for which fully reliable numerical algorithms have not been available.
  We develop fast, reliable basic probability functions (dinvgauss, pinvgauss, qinvgauss
  and rinvgauss) for the IGD that work for all possible parameter values and which
  achieve close to full machine accuracy. The most challenging task is to compute
  quantiles for given cumulative probabilities and we develop a simple but elegant
  mathematical solution to this problem. We show that Newton’s method for finding
  the quantiles of a IGD always converges monotonically when started from the mode
  of the distribution. Simple Taylor series expansions are used to improve accuracy
  on the log-scale. The IGD probability functions provide the same options and obey
  the same conventions as do probability functions provided in the stats package.
