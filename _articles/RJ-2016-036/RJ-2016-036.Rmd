title: 'rnrfa: An R package to Retrieve, Filter and Visualize Data from the UK National
  River Flow Archive'
abstract: 'The UK National River Flow Archive (NRFA) stores several types of hydrological
  data and metadata: daily river flow and catchment rainfall time series, gauging
  station and catchment informa tion. Data are served through the NRFA web services
  via experimental RESTful APIs. Obtaining NRFA data can be unwieldy due to complexities
  in handling HTTP GET requests and parsing responses in JSON and XML formats. The
  rnrfa package provides a set of functions to programmatically access, filter, and
  visualize NRFA data using simple R syntax. This paper describes the structure of
  the rnrfa package, including examples using the main functions gdf() and cmr() for
  flow and rainfall data, respectively. Visualization examples are also provided with
  a shiny web application and functions provided in the package. Although this package
  is regional specific, the general framework and structure could be applied to similar
  databases.'
