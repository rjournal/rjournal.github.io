title: 'rnrfa: An R package to Retrieve, Filter and Visualize Data from the UK National
  River Flow Archive'
abstract: 'The UK National River Flow Archive (NRFA) stores several types of hydrological
  data and metadata: daily river flow and catchment rainfall time series, gauging
  station and catchment information. Data are served through the NRFA web services
  via experimental RESTful APIs. Obtaining NRFA data can be unwieldy due to complexities
  in handling HTTP GET requests and parsing responses in JSON and XML formats. The
  *rnrfa* package provides a set of functions to programmatically access, filter,
  and visualize NRFA data using simple R syntax. This paper describes the structure
  of the *rnrfa* package, including examples using the main functions `gdf()` and
  `cmr()` for flow and rainfall data, respectively. Visualization examples are also
  provided with a *shiny* web application and functions provided in the package. Although
  this package is regional specific, the general framework and structure could be
  applied to similar databases.'

# Introduction

The increasing volume of environmental data available online poses
non-trivial challenges for efficient storage, access and share of this
information [@Vitolo_2015]. An integrated and consistent use of data is
achieved by extracting data directly from web services and processing
them on-the-fly. This improves the flexibility of modelling applications
allowing a more seamless workflow integration, and also avoids the need
to store local copies that would need to be periodically updated,
therefore reducing maintenance issues in the system.

In the hydrology domain, various data providers are adopting web
services and Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) to allow users a
fast and efficient access to public datasets, such as the National River
Flow Archive (NRFA) hosted by the Centre for Ecology and Hydrology in
the United Kingdom. The NRFA is a primary source of information for
hydrologists, modellers, researchers and practitioners operating on UK
catchments. It stores several types of hydrological data and metadata:
gauged daily flow and catchment mean rainfall time series as well as
gauging station and catchment information. Data are typically served
through the NRFA web services via a web-based graphical user interface
(<http://nrfa.ceh.ac.uk/>) and, more recently, via experimental RESTful
APIs. REST (Representational State Transfer) is an architectural style
that uses the HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP) to perform operations
such as accessing resources on the web via a Uniform Resource Identifier
(URI). In simple terms, the location of a NRFA dataset on the web is a
unique string of characters that follows a pattern. This string is
assembled using the rules described in the API documentation and can be
tested by typing the string in the address bar of a web browser.

This paper describes the technical implementation of the
[*rnrfa*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=rnrfa) package [@rnrfa].
The *rnrfa* package takes the complexities related to web development
and data transfer away from the user, providing a set of functions to
programmatically access, filter, and visualize NRFA data using simple R
syntax. Although the NRFA APIs are still in their infancy and prone to
further consolidation and refinement, the experimental implementation of
the *rnrfa* package can be used to test these data services and provide
useful feedback to the provider.

The package is in line with a Virtual Observatory approach
[@beven_etal_2012] as it can be used as back-end tool to link data and
models in a seamless fashion. It complements R's growing functionality
in environmental web technologies [@Web], amongst which are
[*rnoaa*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=rnoaa) [@rnoaa interface to
NOAA climate data API],
[*waterData*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=waterData) [@waterData
interface to the U.S. Geological Survey daily hydrologic data services]
and [*RNCEP*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=RNCEP) [@Kemp_2011
interface to NASA NCEP weather data].

This paper first presents the NRFA archive, its web services and related
APIs. We then illustrate the design and implementation of the *rnrfa*
package, and how it can be used in synergy with existing R packages such
as [*shiny*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=shiny) [@shiny],
[*leaflet*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=leaflet) [@leaflet],
[*rmarkdown*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=rmarkdown)[@rmarkdown],
[*DT*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=DT) [@DT],
[*dplyr*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=dplyr) [@dplyr] and
*parallel* to generate interactive mapping applications, dynamic reports
and big data analytics experiments.

# NRFA web services {#sec:api}

The NRFA web services allow to view, filter and download data via a
graphical user interface. This approach has a number of limitations.
Firstly, time series of daily streamflow discharge and catchment
rainfall can only be downloaded one at the time. Therefore, for large
scale analyses, downloading datasets for hundreds of sites becomes a
rather tedious task. Secondly, metadata can only be visualised (in table
format) but not be downloaded. Metadata analyses may require copying and
pasting large amounts of information introducing potential errors. Due
to the above limitations, the NRFA is also accessible programmatically
via a set of RESTful APIs. The API documentation is not in the public
domain yet, therefore it must be considered experimental and subject to
changes.

Station metadata (called catalogue hereafter) is available in JavaScript
Object Notation (JSON) format. The catalogue contains a total of 18
attributes, which are listed in TableÂ [1](#tab:columns). The NRFA also
provides time series of Gauged Daily Flow (*gdf*, in $m^3/s$) and
Catchment Mean Rainfall (*cmr*, in mm per month), formatted in an XML
variant called WaterML2
(<http://www.opengeospatial.org/standards/waterml>). WaterML2 is an Open
Geospatial Consortium (OGC) standard used worldwide to rigorously and
unambiguously describe hydrological time series. It builds upon existing
standards such as Observations & Measurements [@cox2011observations] for
the metadata section and GML [@gml2013opengis] for the observed time
series. It is typically defined as a "Collection" and made up of five
sections:

-   The metadata section contains the document metadata (e.g., the
    generation date, the version, the generation system and the list of
    profiles utilised).

-   The temporalExtent contains a description of the time period for
    which there are recordings (with a time stamp of start and end
    date).

-   The localDictionary is a gml-based dictionary which stores the
    identifier (e.g., United Kingdom National River Flow Archive) and
    two dictionary entries: The first one describes the type of
    measurement (e.g., Gauged Daily Flow) with details on the variable
    measured (e.g., flow), units (e.g., m3/s) and frequency of
    measurements (e.g., daily); the second entry describes the gauging
    site with details on ratings and their limitations.

-   The samplingFeatureMember describes the monitoring point (e.g.,
    vertical datum and time zone) and the station owner.

-   The observationMember contains a set of nodes which schema is
    borrowed from the OGC Observation and Measurement standard. This
    section contains a gml-based identifier (station identification
    number) and additional information, such as ObservationMetadata
    (contact info, identification info, etc.), phenomenonTime (beginning
    and end of recordings), ObservationProcess (process type and
    reference). Finally the sub-section result contains the measurements
    in a gml-based format.

The nested structure of the WaterML2 files makes parsing of long time
series and related metadata relatively slow and complex. In order to
improve access to NRFA's public data and metadata, we implemented a set
of functions to assemble HTTP GET requests and parse XML/JSON responses
from/to the catalogue and WaterML2 services using simple R syntax.

# Design and implementation

In many hydrological analyses the importance of efficient data retrieval
is often underestimated with the consequence of allocating more time to
this first task then to the data processing and analysis of results. The
*rnrfa* packages provides re-usable functions, based on a consistent
syntax, that attempts to simplify data retrieval and makes it scalable
to multiple data requests.

## Catalogue metadata {#sec:list}

The full list of gauging stations is in JSON format and can be retrieved
using the function `catalogue()`, used with no inputs.

``` r
> allStations <- catalogue()
```

This converts the information into a data frame with one row per station
and 18 columns (TableÂ [1](#tab:columns) contains a detailed description
of the attributes). The reader should note that the server response
includes the Ordnance Survey (OS) grid reference, not latitude and
longitude coordinates. The `catalogue()` function converts the grid
reference to latitude and longitude, then joins the coordinates to the
data frame containing the list of stations.

The conversion is handled by the `osg_parse()` function which can
transform OS grid references of different lengths to: a) latitude and
longitude, in the WSGS84[^2] coordinate system; b) easting and northing,
in the BNG[^3] coordinate system. This function accepts two arguments:
`gridRef`, a character string containing the OS grid reference, and
`CoordSystem`, that can be either `"WGS84"` (default) or `"BNG"`. The
code below shows how to convert an example OS grid reference,
`"NC581062"`, to the two types of coordinates.

``` r
> # Option a: from OS grid reference to WGS84
> osg_parse(gridRef = "NC581062", CoordSystem = "WGS84")

> # Option b: from OS grid reference to BNG
> osg_parse(gridRef = "NC581062", CoordSystem = "BNG")
```

### Filtering stations {#sec:filter}

The `catalogue()` function provides 5 optional arguments that can be
used to filter metadata based on various criteria. The argument `all`,
for instance, is `TRUE` by default and forces all the metadata to be
retrieved. If `all` is set to `FALSE`, the resulting data frame contains
only the following columns: `id`, `name`, `river`, `catchmentArea`,
`lat`, `lon`. This can be used, for instance, to print a concise version
of the table to the screen.

At the time of writing, 1539 stations are monitored within NRFA. Very
rarely the full set of stations is used. Depending on the aim of the
analysis, stations might need to be filtered based on a geographical
bounding box, length of the recording period, thresholds, etc. Below are
some examples showing how to filter stations based on one or multiple
criteria.

#### Filtering based on a geographical bounding box.

Stations can be filtered based on a bounding box thanks to the NRFA web
service and a specific functionality of its API. A bounding box should
be defined as a list of four named elements (minimum longitude, minimum
latitude, maximum longitude and maximum latitude) and passed as input to
the `catalogue()` function using the argument `bbox`. The following
example shows how to define a bounding box for the Plynlimon area
(mid-Wales, United Kingdom), filter the related stations and map their
location using the *ggmap* package. In Figure [1](#fig:map) the location
of each station is shown as a red dot, while the name of the station is
used as a label.

``` r
> # Define a bounding box.
> bbox <- list(lonMin = -3.76, latMin = 52.43, lonMax = -3.67, latMax = 52.48)
> # Filter stations based on bounding box.
> someStations <- catalogue(bbox)
> # Map
> library(ggmap)
> library(ggrepel)
> m <- get_map(location = as.numeric(bbox), maptype = 'terrain')
> ggmap(m) + geom_point(data = someStations, aes(x = lon, y = lat),
+                       col = "red", size = 3, alpha = 0.5) +
>            geom_text_repel(data = someStations, aes(x = lon, y = lat, label = name),
+                            size = 3, col = "red")
```

(red dots). []{#fig:map
label="fig:map"}](mapPlynlimonRedRepel.png){#fig:map width="100%" alt="graphic without alt text"}

#### Filtering based on recording period.

To calculate summary statistics, it is often useful to select only
stations with at least $x$ number of recording years. In the example
below, we select only gauging stations with a minimum of 100 years of
recordings, using the argument `minRec`. The result is a list of three
stations, two of which are located in South England and one in Wales.

``` r
> # Select stations with more than 100 years of recordings.
> s100Y <- catalogue(minRec = 100, all = FALSE)
> # Print s100Y to the screen.
> s100Y

     id     name                 river   catchmentArea  lat      lon
636  38001  Lee at Feildes Weir  Lee     1036           51.76334  0.01277874
665  39001  Thames at Kingston   Thames  9948           51.41501 -0.30887638
1130 55032  Elan at Caban Dam    Elan    184            52.26907 -3.57239164
```

#### Filtering based on metadata entries.

It is also possible to filter stations based on a number of metadata
entries using the arguments: `columnName` (name of the column to filter)
and `columnValue` (string or numeric value to match or compare). The
function `catalogue()` looks for records containing the string
`columnValue` in the column `columnName`. If `columnName` refers to a
character field, the search is case sensitive and can be used to filter
the stations based on the river name, catchment name, location and so
on. In the example below we filter 34 stations falling within the Wye
(Hereford) hydrometric area:

``` r
> stationsWye <- catalogue(columnName = "haName", columnValue = "Wye (Hereford)")
```

If `columnName` refers to a numeric field and `columnValue` contains
special characters such as $>, \ <, \ \geq$ and $\leq$ followed by a
number, stations are filtered using a threshold. For instance, there are
7 stations with drainage area smaller than 1 $Km^2$, which can be
filtered using the command below:

``` r
> stations1KM <- catalogue(columnName = "catchmentArea", columnValue = "<1")
```

### Combined filtering

Filtering capabilities can also be combined. In the example below we
filter all the stations within the above defined bounding box that
belong to the Wye (Hereford) hydrometric area and have a minimum of 50
years of recordings. The only station that satisfies all the criteria is
the Wye at Cefn Brwyn.

``` r
> catalogue(bbox, columnName = "haName", columnValue = "Wye (Hereford)", 
+           minRec = 50, all = FALSE)
	
  id    name               river  catchmentArea  lat       lon
6 55008 Wye at Cefn Brwyn  Wye    10.6           52.43958  -3.724108
```

## WaterML2 services

Once a certain number of stations are selected, time series of gauged
daily flow and catchment mean rainfall data can be obtained by
requesting access to the NRFA WaterML2 service using the functions
`gdf()` and `cmr()`, respectively. These functions assemble and send
data requests to the WaterML2 service, parse responses and convert them
to a time series object (of class from package *xts*). They use the same
syntax and require the following arguments:

-   `id`, the station identification numbers. This can either be a
    single string or a character vector.

-   `metadata`, a logical variable. If set to `FALSE` (default),
    metadata are not parsed. If it is set to `TRUE`, the result for a
    single station is a list of two named elements: `data` (time series)
    and `meta` (metadata).

When `gdf()` and `cmr()` are executed, the assembled data request is
printed to the screen. This is very useful if the user wants to
understand how the API works behind the scenes, but not when
incorporating the code in automated scripts. Although the NRFA API
documentation is not public yet, the patterns are simple and can be
easily extrapolated running a few examples.

### Get gauged daily flow

Raw flow data are typically measured in $m^3/s$, at 15-minute intervals.
Data are first quality controlled, then the daily mean is calculated and
stored in the NRFA public database. These data are typically collected
for the monitoring of river networks but can also be used to calibrate
hydrological models and build forecasting systems. The example below
shows how to get the daily flow for the Tanllwyth at Tanllwyth Flume and
the assembled data request (printed to the console).

``` r
> flow <- gdf(id = "54090")

http://nrfaapps.ceh.ac.uk/nrfa/xml/waterml2?db=nrfa_public&stn=54090&dt=gdf 
```

The result is a time series (of class "xts"). No station-specific
information is stored, because the argument `metadata` is set to `FALSE`
by default. An "xts" object can be easily converted into a data frame
object and exported to a text file (e.g., csv) for use in other
modelling software, as demonstrated in the example below.

``` r
> # Get gauged daily flow for station 54090.
> flow <- gdf(id = "54090")
> # Convert to csv.
> write.csv(as.data.frame(flow), "flowDF.csv", quote = FALSE)
```

### Get catchment mean rainfall

The main forcing input in any hydrological model is rainfall. In many
cases it is important to calculate the average rainfall over a
catchment, this is achieved by using geospatial interpolation methods
or, more simplistically, calculating the weighted average using a number
of weather stations within the catchment and/or in the nearby areas. The
NRFA provides pre-calculated monthly catchment mean rainfall, measured
in $mm$, for a number of UK catchments. As the calculation is consistent
across catchments, these datasets are a valuable resource to ensure
reproducibility of hydrological analyses. Similar to `gdf()`, the
function `cmr()` allows users to retrieve the catchment mean rainfall
data by specifying the argument `id`. The example below shows that, if
we set the argument `metadata` to `TRUE`, we can use metadata to
automatically populate title and labels in a plot, as in Figure
[2](#fig:rainfall). The reader should note that `rain$data` is an "xts"
object, therefore `plot(rain$data)` uses the S3 method for "xts".

``` r
> rain <- cmr(id = "54090", metadata = TRUE)
> data <- rain$data
> meta <- rain$meta
> plot(data, main = paste(meta$variable, "-", meta$stationName),
+      xlab = "", ylab = meta$units)
```

![Figure 2: Monthly catchment mean rainfall for the Tanllwyth at
Tanllwyth Flume catchment. []{#fig:rainfall
label="fig:rainfall"}](rainfall.png){#fig:rainfall width="100%" alt="graphic without alt text"}

Station information consists of: the station name, location in latitude
and longitude coordinates, the variable measured (i.e., rainfall), units
(i.e., $mm$), aggregation function (i.e., accumulation), time step of
recording (i.e., month) and time zone.

### Convert and compare flow and rainfall for a given catchment

In the NRFA, flow and rainfall are stored in $m^3/s$ and $mm/month$,
respectively, therefore they are not directly comparable. However, given
the catchment area (from the metadata catalogue), the flow can be easily
converted into $mm/day$ and then compared to the rainfall, for instance
by plotting them on the same time line. Although the operations are
trivial, it is a relatively lengthy procedure that can be simplified
using the function `plot_rain_flow()`. This function uses the station
`id` as input to request metadata as well as flow and rainfall time
series for the given catchment, converts the flow from its original
units to $mm/day$ and then plots the converted flow and rainfall on two
different $y$-axes so that they can be visually compared, as shown in
Figure [3](#fig:plotRainFlow).

``` r
> plot_rain_flow(id = "54090")
```

![Figure 3: Monthly catchment mean rainfall and daily flow for the
Tanllwyth at Tanllwyth Flume catchment. []{#fig:plotRainFlow
label="fig:plotRainFlow"}](plotRainFlow.png){#fig:plotRainFlow
width="100%" alt="graphic without alt text"}

### Multiple sites

The package *rnrfa* is particularly useful for large scale data
acquisition. If the `id` argument is a vector, the functions `gdf()` and
`cmr()` can be used to sequentially fetch time series (meta)data from
multiple sites. As the server can handle multiple requests, concurrent
calls can be sent simultaneously using the *parallel* package. In order
to send concurrent calls, a cluster object, created by the *parallel*
package, should be passed to `gdf()` or `cmr()` using the argument `cl`.
Below is a simple benchmark test in which we compare the processing time
for collating flow time series data for the 9 stations in the Plynlimon
area sending: a) 1 data request at the time and b) 9 simultaneous
requests. The operations are repeated 10 times. The results are averaged
and summarised in Table [2](#tab:benchmark), which shows that (a) takes
about 18 seconds, while (b) about 8 seconds. The reader should note that
the time for retrieval does not reduce proportionally with the number of
simultaneous requests because there is a limit in the number of calls
the server can handle, which depends on the infrastructure and the
number of incoming requests from other users.

``` r
> library(microbenchmark)
> library(parallel)
> cl <- makeCluster(getOption("cl.cores", 9))
> microbenchmark(# sequential requests
+                gdf(id = someStations$id, metadata = FALSE, cl = NULL),
+                # concurrent requests
+                gdf(id = someStations$id, metadata = FALSE, cl = cl), times = 10)
> stopCluster(cl)
```

# Some applications

The *rnrfa* package is an ideal building block for many scientific
workflows but can also work as back-end tool for a number of web
applications, from interactive mapping and dynamic reports that improve
reproducibility of analysis, to the integration into more sophisticated
big data analytics experiments. This can be achieved thanks to the
intrinsic interoperability of the R environment. Some example
applications are given in the following sections.

## Dynamic mapping and reporting application

Here we demonstrate the generation of a dynamic mapping and reporting
application to summarise stations' metadata and map the spatial
distribution of the monitoring network for each operator. The user can
select the name of the operator using a drop-down menu and the dynamic
document automatically renders an interactive map showing a marker for
each station in the network on top of a background map based on
OpenStreetMap. Users can zoom in/out and navigate to a specific area.
Finally, the user can click on a marker to read name and station
identification number from a pop-up window. Figure
[4](#fig:DynamicReportingMapping) shows a screenshot of the web
application. At the bottom of the page is a dynamic table that
summarises the metadata associated with the selected stations in the
network. The table can be filtered using an interactive search box. The
textual content also updates automatically the reporting of the number
of stations within the selected network. The web application depends on
the following packages: *rmarkdown*, *knitr*, *shiny*, *leaflet* and
*DT* and its source code is available as gist at the following URL:
<https://gist.github.com/cvitolo/d5d46b5e8f3676013857>.

## Geoprocessing based on user-defined areas

The NRFA web site does not allow users to execute geoprocessing tasks,
for instance, to intersect the list of stations with user-defined or
externally sourced areas. In some cases it might be of interest to
explore the distribution of stations based on high-level administrative
boundaries such as regions/countries. This is useful to understand
whether there are differences in the reliability of the networks that
can be explained by the different management approaches. Eurostat
established a hierarchy of three levels of administrative divisions
within each European country, called Nomenclature of Territorial Units
for Statistics (NUTS)[^4]. At the first level, UK is divided into 12
regions: Northern Ireland, Scotland, Wales and 9 English sub-regions
(East Midlands, East of England, Greater London, North East, North West,
South East, South West, West Midlands, Yorkshire and the Humber).
Calculating, for instance, the number/density of stations by region is
not possible using the NRFA web site because the stations' metadata does
not contain information on this type of administrative region and users
cannot specify their own. However, these simple geoprocessing operations
become relatively trivial using the *rnrfa* package.

The procedure consists of five steps:

-   retrieve the list of NRFA stations (using the `catalogue()`
    function);

-   load the NUTS (level 1) shapefile and reproject the polygon to the
    geographic coordinate system WGS84 (using the *rgdal* and *sp*
    packages);

-   transform the NRFA list of stations into a `SpatialPointDataFrame` ;

-   spatially overlay NRFA stations (points) and NUTS1 regions
    (polygons);

-   add a new column, containing the name of the NUTS1 regions, to the
    list of NRFA stations.

The updated list of stations is included, as sample dataset, in the data
folder of this package, under the name `stationSummary`.
TableÂ [3](#tab:NUTS1) summarises the number of stations per region, the
area of each region (in $Km^2$), and the density of stations (number of
stations/$Km^2$). The metadata can now be easily summarised by NUTS1
region, for instance the boxplot in FigureÂ [5](#fig:BoxPlotsNUTS1) shows
the distribution of years of recording. Northern Ireland seem to have
the youngest network, with recording years in the range \[16, 44\]. Only
three regions have stations with more than 100 years of recordings: East
of England, London and Wales. Scotland and Northern Ireland have the
lowest density of gauging stations, while Greater London the highest.

## Big data analytics experiment

In the last few years, the UK MetOffice has reported "unusual warmth and
lack of rainfall during March and April, particularly over England and
Wales"[^5]. Dry springs can affect water resources, because river flow
below average translates, for instance, in reduced availability of
drinking water. In this section we present a big data analytics
experiment in which we try to understand if there is any evidence, in
the NRFA data, that springs in the UK are becoming drier, both in terms
of rainfall and river flow. This type of experiment consists of
retrieving all the available rainfall and flow time series and find out,
for each station, whether there is an increasing/decreasing trend.

Using the NRFA web site, the comparison of time series is only feasible
for a limited number of sites. Time series should be first downloaded as
text files and then compared manually. The biggest advantage of using
the *rnrfa* package, instead, is that multiple downloads can be
automated using a single line of code.

In this experiment we used a cluster of 64 cores to download and analyse
all the time series available from the NRFA stations with more than 10
years of recordings. The time series were first downloaded, then
summarised in terms of annual averages over the spring period. Seasonal
averages can be calculated using the function `seasonal_averages()`,
which takes as input a time series and a period of interest (e.g.,
spring) and calculates the related annual average. Using a very
simplistic approach, a linear model was fit to the annual averages and
the slope coefficient was used to estimate the trend. Negative slopes
correspond to decreasing flow/rainfall, while positive slopes correspond
to an increase of flow/rainfall over time. Once the fitted slope is
calculated for each station, the results can be plotted using the
function `plot_trend()`. Figures [6](#fig:SpringTrendCMR) and
[7](#fig:SpringTrend) show only the statistically significant trends for
rainfall and flow respectively. Each figure is divided into two plots:
Plot A shows the spatial distribution of negative trends with red dots
and positive trends with blue dots; plot B shows the variability of
trends over NUTS1 regions. In the latter plot, outliers are removed by
showing only values between the 5th and 95th quantiles. From a
meteorological perspective (Figure [6](#fig:SpringTrendCMR)), there are
only positive statistically significant trends and Scotland shows the
largest. In terms of hydrological responses (Figure
[7](#fig:SpringTrend)), trends are more subtle as the interquartile
range is concentrated around zero. The most extreme negative trends were
found in Scotland and North East England.

The entire run took about 31 minutes, the code to reproduce this example
is available as gist at the following URL:
<https://gist.github.com/cvitolo/612eb2ae9b47fe8f11a1ed8d06e3b434>.
There are certainly more rigorous methodologies to estimate seasonal
trends. This experiment was just an attempt to demonstrate that the
*rnrfa* can simplify large scale data acquisition tasks.

# A note on package usage {#sec:note}

The [*cranlogs*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=cranlogs)
[@cranlogs] package provides an API interface to download logs from the
RStudio CRAN mirror which contains download counts from unique IP
addresses and can be used as a proxy to estimate the volume of package
users. By September 2016, the *rnrfa* package had been downloaded from
CRAN 6372 times, just from this mirror, following a trend very similar
to the *waterData* package (see Figure [8](#fig:rnrfaVSwaterdata)).
Because the RStudio mirror is located in the US, it is expected that the
download counts from UK mirrors could be even higher. We derive that
this package is of interest for a large community of users, which gives
us scope for future developments.

# Summary {#sec:summary}

This article describes the *rnrfa* package for interacting
programmatically with the UK National River Flow Archive. It allows to
access web resources such as the catalogue of stations' metadata and the
WaterML2 service to retrieve gauged daily flow and (monthly) catchment
mean rainfall. The package provides functions to query the catalogue
based on various criteria (e.g., geographical bounding box, minimum
number of recording years, river catchment/hydrometric area/operators
amongst many other options), retrieve and visualise flow and rainfall
time series, convert coordinates and flow measurements, and plot basic
seasonal trends grouped on user defined regions. Some of these
capabilities are strongly linked to the particular content of the NRFA
database and are not directly transferable/applicable to other data
sources. However the `gdf()` and `cmr()` functions could be re-used,
with minimal changes, to get data/metadata from other providers adopting
the WaterML2 standard.

The package is a convenient standalone application that allows NRFA
users a more efficient access to the public database, compared to the
web interface, e.g., the possibility to efficiently retrieve data from
multiple sites. The *rnrfa* package can also be used as back-end tool
for web applications. Amongst the existing R interfaces to data APIs,
*rnrfa* follows a logic similar to *waterData*: Sites are first
identified through a catalogue, streamflow data are imported via the
station identification number, then data are visualised and/or used in
analyses. However, our package does not implement any function for data
cleanup, because NRFA data are highly quality controlled. Users can
currently take advantage of other packages such as *xts* to calculate
aggregate variables, [*evd*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=evd)
[@evd] for the analysis of extreme events,
[*outliers*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=outliers) [@outliers] to
identify possible outliers and *sp* and
[*spacetime*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=spacetime)
[@spacetime-2; @sp2] for more advanced spatio-temporal processing.

In the future, we plan to implement additional processing functions
(e.g., to compare gdf with flow in bankfull condition which is highly
important for flood frequency estimations). Further developments are
also scheduled on the NRFA side to include Web Feature Service (WFS),
Sensor Observation Services (SOS) and updates to WaterML2 OGC standards.
WFS layers can already be loaded and manipulated using *rgdal* [@rgdal],
while [*sos4R*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=sos4R) [@sos4R-2] can
be used as client for SOS.
