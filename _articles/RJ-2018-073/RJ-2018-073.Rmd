title: 'bnclassify: Learning Bayesian Network Classifiers'
abstract: The bnclassify package provides state-of-the art algorithms for learning
  Bayesian network classifiers from data. For structure learning it provides variants
  of the greedy hill-climbing search, a well-known adaptation of the Chow-Liu algorithm
  and averaged one-dependence estimators. It provides Bayesian and maximum likelihood
  parameter estimation, as well as three naive-Bayes specific methods based on discriminative
  score optimization and Bayesian model averaging. The implementation is efficient
  enough to allow for time-consuming discriminative scores on medium sized data sets.
  The bnclassify package provides utilities for model evaluation, such as cross-validated
  accuracy and penalized log-likelihood scores, and analysis of the underlying networks,
  including network plotting via the Rgraphviz package. It is extensively tested,
  with over 200 automated tests that give a code coverage of 94%. Here we present
  the main functionalities, illustrate them with a number of data sets, and comment
  on related software.
