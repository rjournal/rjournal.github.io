title: 'Dot-Pipe: an S3 Extensible Pipe for R'
abstract: Pipe notation is popular with a large league of R users, with magrittr being
  the dominant realization. However, this should not be enough to consider piping
  in R as a settled topic that is not subject to further discussion, experimentation,
  or possibility for improvement. To promote innovation opportunities, we describe
  the wrapr R package and “dot-pipe” notation, a well behaved sequencing operator
  with S3 extensibility. We include a number of examples of using this pipe to interact
  with and extend other R packages.
