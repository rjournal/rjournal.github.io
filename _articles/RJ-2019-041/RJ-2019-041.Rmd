title: Using Web Services to Work with Geodata in R
abstract: Through collaborative mapping, a massive amount of data is accessible. Many
  individuals contribute information each day. The growing amount of geodata is gathered
  by volunteers or obtained via crowd-sourcing. One outstanding example of this is
  the OpenStreetMap (OSM) Project which provides access to big data in geography.
  Another online mapping service that enables the integration of geodata into the
  analysis is Google Maps. The expanding content and the availability of geographic
  information radically changes the perspective on geodata (Chilton 2009). Recently
  many application programming interfaces (APIs) have been built on OSM and Google
  Maps. That leads to a point where it is possible to access sections of geographical
  information without the usage of a complex database solution, especially if one
  only requires a small data section for a visualization. First tools for spatial
  analysis have been included in the R language very early (Bivand and Gebhardt, 2000)
  and this development will continue to accelerate, underpinning a continual change.
  Notably, in recent years many tools have been developed to enable the usage of R
  as a geographic information system (GIS). With a GIS it is possible to process spatial
  data. QuantumGIS (QGIS) is a free software solution for these tasks, and a user
  interface is available for this purpose. R is, therefore, an alternative to geographic
  information systems like QGIS (QGIS Development Team 2009). Besides, add-ins for
  QGIS and R-packages (RQGIS) are available, that enables the combination of R and
  QGIS (Muenchow and Schratz 2017). It is the target of this article to present some
  of the most important R-functionalities to download and process geodata from OSM
  and the Google Maps API. The focus of this paper is on functions that enable the
  natural usage of these APIs.
