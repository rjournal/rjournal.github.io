title: Correspondence Analysis on Generalised Aggregated Lexical Tables (CA-GALT)
  in the FactoMineR Package
abstract: Correspondence analysis on generalised aggregated lexical tables (CA-GALT)
  is a method that generalizes classical CA-ALT to the case of several quantitative,
  categorical and mixed variables. It aims to establish a typology of the external
  variables and a typology of the events from their mutual relationships. In order
  to do so, the influence of external variables on the lexical choices is untangled
  cancelling the associations among them, and to avoid the instability issued from
  multicollinearity, they are substituted by their principal components. The CaGalt
  function, implemented in the FactoMineR package, provides numerous numerical and
  graphical outputs. Confidence ellipses are also provided to validate and improve
  the representation of words and variables. Although this methodology was developed
  mainly to give an answer to the problem of analyzing open-ended questions, it can
  be applied to any kind of frequency/contingency table with external variables.
