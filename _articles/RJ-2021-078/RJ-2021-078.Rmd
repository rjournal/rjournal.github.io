title: Elliptical Symmetry Tests in R
abstract: The assumption of elliptical symmetry has an important role in many theoretical
  develop ments and applications. Hence, it is of primary importance to be able to
  test whether that assumption actually holds true or not. Various tests have been
  proposed in the literature for this problem. To the best of our knowledge, none
  of them has been implemented in R. This article describes the R package ellipticalsymmetry
  which implements several well-known tests for elliptical symmetry together with
  some recent tests. We demonstrate the testing procedures with a real data example.
