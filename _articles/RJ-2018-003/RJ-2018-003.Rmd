title: 'Epistemic Game Theory: Putting Algorithms to Work'
abstract: The aim of this study is to construct an epistemic model in which each rational
  choice under common belief in rationality is supplemented by a type which expresses
  such a belief. In practice, the finding of type depends on manual solution approach
  with some mathematical operations in scope of the theory. This approach becomes
  less convenient with the growth of the size of the game. To solve this difficulty,
  a linear programming model is constructed for two-player, static and non-cooperative
  games to find the type that is supporting that player’s rational choice is optimal
  under common belief in rationality and maximizing the utility of the game. Since
  the optimal choice would only be made from rational choices, it is first necessary
  to eliminate all strictly dominated choices. In real life, the games are usually
  large sized. Therefore, the elimination process should be performed in a computer
  environment. Since software related to game theory was mostly prepared with a result-oriented
  approach for some types of games, it was necessary to develop software to execute
  the iterated elimination method. With this regard, a program has been developed
  that determines the choices that are strictly dominated by pure and randomized choices
  in two-player games. Two functions named “esdc” and “type” are created by using
  R statistical programming language for the operations performed in both parts, and
  these functions are added to the content of an R package after its creation with
  the name EpistemicGameTheory.
