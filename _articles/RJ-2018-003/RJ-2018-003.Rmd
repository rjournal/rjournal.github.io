title: 'Epistemic Game Theory: Putting Algorithms to Work'
abstract: The aim of this study is to construct an epistemic model in which each rational
  choice under common belief in rationality is supplemented by a type which expresses
  such a belief. In practice, the finding of type depends on manual solution approach
  with some mathematical operations in scope of the theory. This approach becomes
  less convenient with the growth of the size of the game. To solve this difficulty,
  a linear programming model is constructed for two-player, static and non-cooperative
  games to find the type that is supporting that player's rational choice is optimal
  under common belief in rationality and maximizing the utility of the game. Since
  the optimal choice would only be made from rational choices, it is first necessary
  to eliminate all strictly dominated choices. In real life, the games are usually
  large sized. Therefore, the elimination process should be performed in a computer
  environment. Since software related to game theory was mostly prepared with a result-oriented
  approach for some types of games, it was necessary to develop software to execute
  the iterated elimination method. With this regard, a program has been developed
  that determines the choices that are strictly dominated by pure and randomized choices
  in two-player games. Two functions named "esdc" and "type" are created by using
  R statistical programming language for the operations performed in both parts, and
  these functions are added to the content of an R package after its creation with
  the name ***EpistemicGameTheory***.

# Introduction

In order to evaluate the possible results of the decision, it is very
important to constitute a belief about opponents' feasible preferences
which can affect their choices. In addition to this, the precondition of
making a good choice requires having a reasonable belief about
opponents' choices. However, in general each belief of players may not
be reasonable according to their opponents. The player should determine
the opponent's possible idea about his opponent with putting himself
into his opponent's shoes, to decide which choice is reasonable for his
opponent or which choice would not be preferred by him. In other words,
before surmising an idea about opponents' choices, it is compulsory to
reason their system of thought. Indeed, Oskar Morgenstern who is one of
the earliest founders of game theory, has highlighted this subject in
his article "Perfect Foresight and Economic Equilibrium" which was
published in 1935. In his article, Morgenstern has explained the
significance of having idea about beliefs of the opponents, analyzing
the opponents' systems of thought properly and establishing a reasonable
relation to make a good decision [@Morgenstern]. However, the importance
of this concept frequently has been underestimated in the studies on
game theory, which have been published in last sixty years.
Morgenstern's bold idea of using the tools of formal logic to talk about
how members of a social system think, about how they think about what
other members think, and so on, was far ahead of its time. However now,
in the form of epistemic game theory, it has found a home
[@brandenburger2010origins].

The discipline that studies these patterns of reasoning, and how they
influence the eventual choices of the players, is called epistemic game
theory [@Perea2012].[^1]

Approximately twenty-five years ago, conceptual changes have emerged
with the introduction of epistemic game theory. This new branch of
science has brought game theory back to its fundamental concepts, its
background. In other words, it has brought game theory back to
reasonable modeling of players' beliefs about their opponents. At the
core of epistemic game theory, there is the fact that people have
different tendencies to reason under same circumstances in a game.
Therefore, it is not true reasoning in a unique way and claiming that it
is the best option. Under such conditions, it can be said that there are
only different reasoning ways, and it should be avoided that claiming on
which one is better. In epistemic approach, the aim is to define the
methods of reasoning, which can be used in the game, and to examine how
the method affects the result of the game.

# Concepts Of Epistemic Game Theory

## Belief about opponents' choices

The belief of a player about choices of his opponents is a probability
distribution which is defined over the set
$C_{-i}= C_1\times \ldots \times C_{i-1} \times C_{i+1} \times \ldots \times C_n$
where $C_i$ is the set of player i's choices. The probability value
which is assigned by player i for his opponents' each choice
combination, is obtained by
$b_i (c_1,\ldots,c_{i-1},c_{i+1},\ldots,c_n )$.

Let us symbolize the utility function of player i with $u_i$ and the
belief about the choices of his opponents with $b_i$. Accordingly,
expected utility of player $i$ from choosing the choice $c_i$ is
calculated by the equation below.

$$u_i (c_i,b_i ) = \sum_{(c_1,\ldots,c_{i-1},c_{i+1},\ldots,c_n )\in C_{-i}}b_i(c_1,\ldots,c_{i-1},c_{i+1},\ldots,c_n) \times u_i (c_1,\ldots,c_{i-1},c_i,c_{i+1},\ldots,c_n )$$

## Belief hierarchies and type

The concept of belief hierarchies is the basic element of epistemic
approach. In an $n$-player game, the belief hierarchies for player $i$
is as follows:

1.  The belief that player $i$ has about his opponents'
    choice-combinations,

2.  The belief that player $i$ has about the beliefs that his opponents
    have about their opponents' choice-combinations,

3.  The belief that player $i$ has about the beliefs that his opponents
    have about the beliefs that their opponents have about the other
    players' choice-combinations,

and so on, ad infinitum. The first belief for player $i$ is his
first-order belief, the second belief is his second-order belief, and so
on.

The belief hierarchies have some disadvantages both theoretically and
practically. In theory, it is difficult to make a mathematical
description of the hierarchy. In practice, it is often impossible to
write and express each stage of the infinite hierarchy (first-order
belief, second-order belief, etc.). For this reason, an approach that
can express the hierarchy in a shorter and more formal way is needed.

The concept of infinite belief hierarchy has brought to game theory by
John Harsanyi. He has worked on incomplete information games, also
called Bayesian games, where players have incomplete information about
the parameters of the game. It is aimed to model the beliefs of each
player about the unknown parameters of the game, each player's beliefs
about the other players' beliefs about these parameters, and so on ad
infinitum. This may be called the explicit approach and is in fact
feasible. However, the explicit approach is mathematically rather
cumbersome and hardly manageable. Indeed, this was a major obstacle to
the development of the theory of games with incomplete information at
its early stages. The breakthrough was provided by John Harsanyi in a
seminal work [@Harsanyi1967] that awarded him the Nobel Prize in 1994
after thirty years. While Harsanyi actually formulated the problem
verbally, in an explicit way, he suggested a solution that 'avoided' the
difficulty of having to deal with infinite hierarchies of beliefs, by
providing a much more workable implicit, encapsulated model [@Zamir].

The concept of a type is the basis of the Harsanyi model. As a concept,
type can be considered as a precise definition of players' belief
hierarchies about unknown parameters of the game. It is a special
representation of the player's beliefs about the actual parameters
involved and the answers to the types of other players. This
characteristic of the types gives the player the ability to
self-reference inevitably that is, the ability to decide the types of
other players through their own types in an interactive decision-making
environment.

The construction that Harsanyi proposed in the context of a game with
incomplete information on the preferences of the players was very
simple: For every player, define a set of types, and for every type
define a utility function, together with a probabilistic belief about
the opponents' types [@Harsanyi1967].

The content of the type in epistemic game theory differs from that of
Harsanyi. While Harsanyi forms belief hierarchies for parameters of the
game, epistemic game theory deals with the choices of the players. In
the studies [@armbruster1979bayesian] and [@Boge], belief hierarchies
have been used to describe the beliefs of players about their opponents'
choices.

Let us denote the belief hierarchy with $t_i^c$ which supports player
$i$'s any choice $c$. In the literature, belief hierarchy is also used
as epistemic type (or briefly type). Therefore, $t_i$ represents an
epistemic type of the player $i$.

## Epistemic model

Let us consider an $n$-player game. The epistemic model, firstly,
indicates possible types for each player. Let us symbolize the set of
all possible types for every player $i$ with $T_i$. Each type $t_i$
stores information about the beliefs on the choices of player $i$'s
opponents and their types. The problem that arises here is how this
belief can be expressed mathematically.

As it is known, every player $i$'s belief about choices of his opponents
is a probability distribution $b_i$ which has been defined on the set
$C_{-i}=C_1 \times \ldots \times C_{i-1} \times C_{i+1} \times \ldots \times C_n. t_i$
should have information about not only the belief about choices of his
opponents but also information about his opponents' types. Thus, $t_i$
represents the choice-type combinations of player $i$'s opponents.

The set that contains all possible choice-type combinations of any
opponent $j$ of player $i$ is $C_j \times T_j$. In parallel with this
definition, the set of all choice-type combinations of player $i$'s
opponents' becomes
$(C_1 \times T_1) \times \ldots \times (C_{i-1} \times T_{i-1} )\times(C_{i+1}\times T_{i+1} )\times \ldots \times (C_n \times T_n)$.
This set includes all possible combinations
$((c_1,t_1),\ldots,(c_{i-1},t_{i-1} ),(c_{i+1},t_{i+1} ),\ldots,(c_n,t_n))$.

An epistemic model specifies probability distribution $b_i (t_i )$
defined on the set of all possible choice-type combinations
$(C_1\times T_1)\times \ldots \times (C_{i-1} \times T_{i-1} ) \times (C_{i+1}\times T_{i+1} )\times \ldots \times (C_n \times T_n)$
for every player $i$ and each type $t_i\in T_i$. The probability
distribution of $b_i (t_i)$ represents the belief that type $t_i$ has
about the opponents' choices and types.

Consider a type $t_i$ for player i within an epistemic model. The choice
$c_i$ is rational for type $t_i$ if it maximizes the expected utility
for the belief that $t_i$ holds about the opponents' choice-type
combinations.

The entire belief hierarchy can be expressed with an epistemic model.
Constructing an epistemic model is easier than establishing a belief
hierarchy. This is an important advantage of epistemic model. Another
advantage of the epistemic model is that it can be defined by a
mathematical expression conveniently.

# Deciding Under Common Belief In Rationality

Type $t_i$ is said to believe in the opponents' rationality if for every
opponent $j$, and every choice-type pair $(c_j,t_j)\in C_j \times T_j$
to which $t_i$ assigns positive probability, the choice $c_j$ is
rational for type $t_j$.

In order to define common belief in rationality, firstly, the definition
of k-fold belief in rationality is needed and explained as follows.

## $k$-fold belief in rationality

Consider an epistemic model.

1.  Type $t_i$ expresses 1-fold belief in rationality if $t_i$ believes
    in the opponents' rationality.

2.  Type $t_i$ expresses 2-fold belief in rationality if $t_i$ only
    assigns positive probability to the opponents' types that express
    1-fold belief in rationality.

3.  Type $t_i$ expresses 3-fold belief in rationality if $t_i$ only
    assigns positive probability to the opponents' types that express
    2-fold belief in rationality.

And so on. Thus, $k$-fold belief in rationality can be recursively
defined for every number $k$.

## Rational choice under belief in the opponents' rationality

The choice $c_1^*$ is the optimal choice for player $i$, if the expected
utility of the choice $c_i^*$ is maximum
$(u_i (c_i^*,b_i) \geq u_i (c_i,b_i))$.

If the choice $c_i^*$ is optimal with reference to player $i$'s belief
about the opponents' behavior patterns, then $c_i^*$ is called as a
rational choice.

Player $i$ believes that his opponents are rational if he assigns
positive probability for only his opponent's rational choices.

If the choice $c_i$ of player $i$ is optimal for some belief $b_i$ about
the choices of his opponents' while believing in the opponents'
rationality, then the choice $c_i$ is a rational choice for player $i$
under belief in the opponents' rationality.

The concept of rational choice in game theory sometimes causes
confusion. In the context of this study, the word "rational" is used as
follows: If a player has built a belief about his opponent's choices,
and has made the optimal choice for himself under this belief, he has
made a rational choice. However, this player may have had an
unreasonable belief about the opponent, and making rational choice does
not guarantee making the reasonable choice. Reasonability carries a
subjective meaning and depends on the mindset of the person. Something
that is reasonable for one may not be reasonable for another. Therefore,
it is impossible to make a single definition of reasonable choice.

The reasonable choice should not only be rational under the belief in
the opponents' rationality, but at the same time, it should be optimal
according to a reasonable belief about the opponents' choices. What is
open to debate is when does a belief about the opponent be reasonable?
Epistemic game theory examines the answer to this question.

## Rational choice under common belief in rationality

In an epistemic model, if the type $t_i$ expresses $k$-fold belief in
rationality for every $k$, it can be said that $t_i$ expresses common
belief in rationality. If $t_i$ expresses common belief in rationality
and the choice $c_i$ is optimal for the type $t_i$, then $c_i$ is a
rational choice under common belief in rationality.

Common belief in rationality does not only mean that you believe that
your opponents choose rationally, but you also believe that your
opponents believe that their opponents will choose rationally, and that
your opponents believe that their opponents believe that the other
players will choose rationally, and so on.

Consider an epistemic model, which contains type sets $T_1,\ldots,T_n$.
If the player $i$'s choice $c_i$ is not supported to express common
belief in rationality by any type in $T_i$, this does not mean that the
choice $c_i$ cannot be chosen under common belief in rationality. There
may be another epistemic model that has a type supporting the choice
$c_i$ to express common belief in rationality. The purpose of this work
is to seek an answer to the question that how this epistemic model can
be detected.

**Algorithm 1** *(Choices that can be rationally chosen under common
belief in rationality)*:

An algorithm has been required to use in order to find the choices that
can be rationally chosen under common belief in rationality. *Algorithm
1* is based on the following theorem.

**Theorem 1**: A choice $c_i$ is irrational if and only if it is
strictly dominated by another pure or randomized choice. In other words,
a choice $c_i$ is rational if and only if it cannot be strictly
dominated by another pure or randomized choice [^2] [@Pearce].

By *Theorem 1*, the algorithm is explained as follows.

1\) Eliminate all strictly dominated choices in the original game.

2\) Eliminate all strictly dominated choices in the reduced game
obtained after the step (1).

3\) Eliminate all strictly dominated choices in the reduced game
obtained after the step (2).

‚ãÆ

Repeat this process until no strategy can be eliminated.

This algorithm ends with a finite number of steps and gives a set of
choices that are not empty for each player if the game is finite. The
order of elimination and speed do not affect the result.

**Theorem 2**: [@BrandenburgerDekel] and [@Tan] proved that, if the
choices can be rationally made under $k$-fold belief in rationality for
each $k\geq1$, then these choices are also survived $(k+1)$-fold
elimination. This can be generalized as; the rational choices under
common belief in rationality are the choices that survive the iterated
elimination of strictly dominated choices.

# Algorithms For Finding Types That Express Common Belief In Rationality For Optimal Choices

In practice, the finding of type depends on non-computer based approach
with some mathematical operations in scope of the theory. This approach
becomes less convenient with the growth of the size of the game. For
this reason, we construct a linear programming model for two-player,
static and non-cooperative games to find the type that is supporting
that player $i$'s rational choice $c_i$ is optimal under common belief
in rationality and maximizing the utility of the game. Since the optimal
choice would only be made from rational choices, it is first necessary
to eliminate all strictly dominated choices. By the reason of software
related to game theory was mostly prepared with a result-oriented
approach for some solution methods and some types of games, it was
necessary to develop software to execute the iterated elimination
method. With this regard, we developed a computer program that
determines the choices that are strictly dominated by pure and
randomized choices in two-player games. Ba≈üer transformed the operations
performed in both parts to software by using R Statistical Programming
Language and created a package with the name
[***EpistemicGameTheory***](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=EpistemicGameTheory)
[@Baser1].

The ***EpistemicGameTheory*** R package containing functions named
`esdc` and `type` for both purposes explained above. The package
[***roxygen2***](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=roxygen2) was used
to prepare the documentation when the R package was created [@Wickham].

## `esdc` function

As it is known, since the optimal choice is made only from rational
choices, it is first necessary to make iterated elimination of strictly
dominated choices. For this purpose, the steps given in *Algorithm 1*
for two-player games need to be coded into software. We developed
*Algorithm 2* to make the steps of this algorithm suitable for
programming architecture.

Let $n$ be the number of choices of the first player; and $m$ be the
number of choices of the second player; the utility matrix of the first
player would be;

$$A  =
   \begin{bmatrix}
a_{11} & 
a_{12} & 
\cdots & 
a_{1m}\\
a_{21} &
a_{22} &
\cdots &
a_{2m}\\
\vdots &
\vdots &
\ddots &
\vdots\\
a_{n1} &
a_{n2} &
\cdots & 
a_{nm}
   \end{bmatrix}$$

the utility matrix of the second player would be;

$$B  =
\begin{bmatrix}
b_{11} & 
b_{12} & 
\cdots & 
b_{1m}\\
b_{21} &
b_{22} &
\cdots &
b_{2m}\\
\vdots &
\vdots &
\ddots &
\vdots\\
b_{n1} &
b_{n2} &
\cdots & 
b_{nm}
\end{bmatrix}$$

Each entry of matrix A represents a utility level of the first player
while each entry of matrix B represents a utility level of the second
player. The two subscripts of these entries indicate the strategies
chosen by the two players where the first subscript refers to the
strategy chosen by the first player and the second subscript refers to
the strategy chosen by the second player.

**Algorithm 2** *(Creating the Algorithm to be Used in Comparing the
Choices of the First Player)*:

1\) A combination matrix $(C_A)$ is generated that contains all
combinations of $(n,(n-t))$ with $t=1$ at the initial point. Each row of
$C_A$ shows how to compare the choices.

It is aimed to obtain a randomized choice for each row by using its
elements and then compare with the utility level of the choice which
does not exist in that row. For instance, let $c_1^{*}$ be the
randomized choice that is obtained by randomization of the choices
$(c_{11}, c_{12}, \ldots, c_{1(n-t) })$ . Then the utility level of
$c_1^{*}$ is compared with the utility level of the choice that does not
exist in the first row. The randomization process is made with the
procedures in the following steps.

$$C_A  =
\begin{bmatrix}
c_{11} & 
c_{12} & 
\cdots & 
c_{1(n-t)}\\
c_{21} &
c_{22} &
\cdots &
c_{2(n-t)}\\
\vdots &
\vdots &
\ddots &
\vdots\\
c_{n1} &
c_{n2} &
\cdots & 
c_{n(n-t)}
\end{bmatrix}$$

2\) An index matrix $(N)$ with rows equal to the number of rows of the
matrix $C_A$ is generated. Each row of the index matrix is equal and
consists of a number sequence of 1 to $n$.

$$N  =
\begin{bmatrix}
1 & 
2 & 
\cdots & 
n\\
1 & 
2 & 
\cdots & 
n\\
\vdots &
\vdots &
\ddots &
\vdots\\
1 & 
2 & 
\cdots & 
n
\end{bmatrix}$$

3\) A comparison is made between the rows of $C_A$ and N matrices. The
elements existed in $N$ and not in $C_A$ are assigned to the
corresponding row of the difference matrix. The purpose of this step is
identifying the choice for each row which is compared with the
randomized choice that is obtained in step 1.

$$D  =
\begin{bmatrix}
d_{11} & 
d_{12} & 
\cdots & 
d_{1(n-(n-t))}\\
d_{21} &
d_{22} &
\cdots &
d_{2(n-(n-t))}\\
\vdots &
\vdots &
\ddots &
\vdots\\
d_{n1} &
d_{n2} &
\cdots & 
d_{n(n-(n-t))}
\end{bmatrix}$$

4\) For every row of $C_A$, a probability vector $P$ is generated from a
uniform distribution on the $(n-t-1)-$ dimensional simplex.

$$P=(p_1,p_2,\ldots,p_{(n-t) }),  \qquad  p_1+p_2+\ldots+p_{(n-t) }=1$$

According to this probability vector, the first player chooses the first
choice with the probability $p_1$, the second choice with the
probability $p_2, ..., (n-t)$th choice with the probability $p_{(n-t)}$.

5\) Using the obtained probability values, the expected utility for the
first player as a result of choosing the randomized choice is calculated
and compared with the utility provided by the choice not existed in the
related row of the combination matrix.

If the first player believes that second player will choose his first
strategy, the expected utility for the first player would be;

$$p_1 \times a_{11}+p_2\times a_{21}+\ldots+ p_{(n-t)} a_{(n-t)1}=E_1,$$

If the first player believes that second player will choose his second
strategy, the expected utility for the first player is calculated as;

$$p_1\times a_{12}+p_2\times a_{22}+\ldots+ p_{(n-t)} a_{(n-t)2}=E_2,$$

$$\vdots$$

If the first player believes that second player will choose his last
strategy, the expected utility for the first player is as below;

$$p_1\times a_{1m}+p_2\times a_{2m}+\ldots+ p_{(n-t)} a_{(n-t)m}=E_m,$$

If all expected utilities $(E_1,E_2,‚Ä¶,E_m)$ obtained are greater than
the expected utility of the choice pointed by the element in the
corresponding row of matrix $D$, then the strategy is strictly dominated
by that randomized choice. This process is made for every row of $C_A$.

Two situations can arise here:

*Elimination occurs*: In this case, the reduced utility matrix is
obtained. The new $C (n^*,(n^*-t))$ combination matrix is created (where
$n^*$ is the number of rows of the reduced utility matrix) and the above
steps are repeated.

*Elimination does not occur*: In this case, a new probability vector is
generated, and the above steps are repeated. Here it is very important
to decide the number of iterations that determine how many times the
probability vector will be generated and it depends on the dimension of
the game. Therefore, the number of iterations must be sufficiently large
to be able to determine the strictly dominated choices (iteration
$\longrightarrow$ $\infty$). If there is no strictly dominated choice
according to the utility matrix, the value of t is increased by "1" to
form a new combination matrix $C (n,(n-t))$ and the above steps are
repeated.

6\) When $(n^*-t) < 1$ the algorithm ends and the last reduced utility
matrix is obtained.

The last reduced utility matrix determined by the above algorithm
consists of the rational choices of the first player. The same steps are
performed for the second player. The specified steps are written in the
R statistical programming language, and a function named "esdc" is
created. This function gives the reduced game after the iterated
elimination of all strictly dominated choices. The properties of the
function are shown in Figure 1.

**Figure 1:** `esdc` Function

The `esdc` function uses seven arguments. These are; the choice number
of the first player (n), the choice number of the second player (m), the
utility matrix of the first player (A), the vector consisting of the
choice names of the first player (choices.A), the utility matrix of the
second player (B), the vector consisting of the choice names of the
second player (choices.B), and the number of repetitions of the
algorithm (iteration). As a result of the execution of this function,
the reduced utility matrices of the players' that are obtained after
eliminating strictly dominated choices as output.

## `type` function

It is aimed to show that for every player $i$ and every rational choice
$c_i  (i=1,2,‚Ä¶,n)$, there is a type $t_i$, which supports that $c_i$ is
optimal under common belief in rationality.

At the beginning of the game, a type is defined for each element in the
player's choice set. However, the "type" function generates types only
for rational choices because the player do not choose irrational
strategies in practice.

*Construction of Epistemic Model:*

Let $A^*$ be the first player's reduced utility matrix.

$$A^*  =
   \begin{bmatrix}
a_{11} & 
a_{12} & 
\cdots & 
a_{1m}\\
a_{21} &
a_{22} &
\cdots &
a_{2m}\\
\vdots &
\vdots &
\ddots &
\vdots\\
a_{n1} &
a_{n2} &
\cdots & 
a_{nm}
   \end{bmatrix}$$

The first player believes that the second player will likely choose the
first choice with the probability $q_1$, the second choice with the
probability $q_2, \cdots,$ and the final choice with the probability
$q_m$. In this case, according to the preferences of the second player,
the utilities of the first player can be expressed by a linear equation
system.

Under this belief, first player will get the utility $U_1$, if he
chooses his first strategy;

$a_{11} q_1+a_{12} q_2+ \cdots +a_{1m} q_m=U_1$,

he will get the utility $U_2$, if he chooses his second strategy;

$a_{21} q_1+a_{22} q_2+ \cdots +a_{2m} q_m=U_2$

‚ãÆ

he will get the utility $U_i$, if he chooses his ith strategy,

$a_{i1} q_1+a_{i2} q_2+ \cdots +a_{im} q_m=U_i$

‚ãÆ

he will get the utility $U_n$, if he chooses his nth strategy,

$a_{n1} q_1+a_{n2} q_2+ \cdots +a_{nm} q_m=U_n$

The first player prefers his $i$th choice if and only if the inequality
$U_i\geq U_1,U_2,‚Ä¶,U_{(i-1)},\\ U_{(i+1)},‚Ä¶,U_n$ is satisfied. Then,
when is this inequality satisfied?

Let's express this inequality in pairwise comparison;

$U_i\geq U_1 \Longleftrightarrow U_i-U_1\geq 0$

$U_i\geq U_2 \Longleftrightarrow U_i-U_2\geq 0$

‚ãÆ

$U_i\geq U_n \Longleftrightarrow U_i-U_n\geq 0$

Then the linear equation system is obtained by substitution of the
equals of the utilities explicitly, where q is a uniform distribution on
the $(m-1)-$ dimensional simplex.

$(a_{i1}-a_{11} ) q_1+(a_{i2}-a_{12} ) q_2+ \cdots +(a_{im}-a_{1m} ) q_m=U_i-U_1\geq 0$

$(a_{i1}-a_{21} ) q_1+(a_{i2}-a_{22} ) q_2+ \cdots +(a_{im}-a_{2m} ) q_m=U_i-U_2\geq 0$

‚ãÆ

$(a_{i1}-a_{n1} ) q_1+(a_{i2}-a_{n2} ) q_2+ \cdots +(a_{im}-a_{nm} ) q_m=U_i-U_n\geq 0$

Suppose that the first player's $i$th strategy is optimal. In this case,
all the points located in the convex region consisting of the
intersection of the closed half spaces and the hyperplane are those,
which make the $i$ th strategy optimal under common belief in
rationality.

The mathematical model above allows us to find all types that $c_i$ is
optimal under the common belief in rationality for every player $i$ and
every rational choice $c_i   ( i=1,2,‚Ä¶,n)$. By solving this model, an
infinite number of points are obtained. Instead of dealing with infinite
number of points in practice, constructing an epistemic model that there
is a type $t_i$ for each player $i$ and for each rational choice
$c_i  (i=1,2,‚Ä¶,n)$ that supports $c_i$ to be optimal under the common
belief in rationality that maximizes the utility is making more sense.
For this reason, a linear programming model has been established for
each choice. Thus, while showing at least, there is one type making the
relevant choice optimal under common belief in rationality, and it can
also be found the type that maximizing the utility of the player. In
this regard, the linear programming model for the ith choice is
established as follows.

$Z_{max}=a_{i1} q_1+a_{i2} q_2+ \cdots +a_{im} q_m$

$(a_{i1}-a_{11} ) q_1+(a_{i2}-a_{12} ) q_2+ \cdots +(a_{im}-a_{1m} ) q_m\geq 0$

$(a_{i1}-a_{21} ) q_1+(a_{i2}-a_{22} ) q_2+ \cdots +(a_{im}-a_{2m} ) q_m\geq 0$

‚ãÆ

$(a_{i1}-a_{n1} ) q_1+(a_{i2}-a_{n2} ) q_2+ \cdots +(a_{im}-a_{nm} ) q_m\geq 0$

$q_1+q_2+\cdots+q_m=1$

$q_1,q_2,\cdots,q_m\geq 0$

Similar models can be set up for first player's other choices and for
the second player as well. A function named "type" has been created in R
programming language for solving the linear programming model described
above. The features of this function are shown in Figure 2.

The "type" function uses four arguments, named A, B, choices.A and
choices.B. "A" is the reduced utility matrix of the first player, and
"B" is the reduced utility matrix of the second player. "choices.A" and
"choices.B" represent the name of the choices of players as previously
defined. This function uses the "lp" function from the
[***lpSolve***](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=lpSolve) package,
which provides the Simplex method for solving linear programming
problems [@Berkelaar]. As a result of the execution of the "type"
function, probabilities for the types are obtained, which ensure that a
rational strategy is optimal under common belief in rationality and
maximizes the utility of the player.

Since in epistemic game theory, it is important to comprehend why and
how a choice is strictly dominated, the "esdc" function becomes crucial.
Indeed, it is advisable that to execute the "esdc" function before the
types are specified. In other words, the "esdc" function should be
integrated into the "type" function as a prepended operation [@Baser2].

# Application of the Traveler's Dilemma

We applied the two functions to Basu's well-known The Traveler's Dilemma
[@Basu] game to underscore the practical usefulness of this work. Each
player has 99 strategies between 2 and 100. The utility matrices for the
players are created according to the utility function of the Traveler's
Dilemma game.

¬†

**Applying `esdc` Function**\
The arguments for `esdc` function are assigned as given below. For this
numerical example, the "iteration" argument is taken as 500. The name of
choices of both players ("choices.A" and "choices.B") are denominated by
the numbers between 2 to 100.\
\
`n = 99`\
`m = 99`\
`iteration = 500`\
`esdc(n, m, A, choices. A, B, choices. B, iteration)`\
**The Reduced Utility Matrices**\
With the execution of "esdc" function the algorithm eliminates all
strictly dominated choices from the utility matrices A and B. For these
matrices 196 times elimination occurred. The reduced utility matrices
are displayed below. In the last reduced game, the players have only one
choice left, which is choosing a price of "2". Therefore, they can only
rationally choose a price of "2" under common belief in rationality.\

**Applying `type` Function**\
The `type` function is executed for finding types for rational choices
under common belief in rationality given in the reduced matrices for
both players. The definitions of arguments are shown below.\
\
`A<-matrix(c(2),1,1)`\
`B<-matrix(c(2),1,1)`\
`choices.A = c("2")`\
`choices.B = c("2")`\
`type(A, B, choices. A, choices. B)`\
**The Output of `type` Function**\
The output of `type` function includes the coefficients of the linear
equation system, the types that supports relevant choice under common
belief in rationality and the maximum utility of the player. For this
example, the output of `type` function is displayed below.\
\
`type(A,B,choices.A,choices.B)`\
`[1] "The utility matrix of Player 1:"`\
` 2 `\
`2 2`\
`Player 1‚Äôs type for the strategy 2 : 1 `\
`Success: the objective function is 2 `\
`[1] "The utility matrix of Player 2:"`\
\
`2 2`\
`Player 2‚Äôs type for the strategy 2 : 1 `\
`Success: the objective function is 2`\
The epistemic model of the first player was created as follows using
belief probabilities from the output of `type` function that make every
rational choice of the first player optimal under common belief in
rationality.

Type: $T_1=${$t_1^2$}

Belief for the first player:

$\quad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad b_1 (t_1^2 )=(2,t_2^2)$

The epistemic model is constructed by using the values for the second
player from the output of `type` function as follows:

Type: $T_2 =${$t_2^2$}

Belief for the second player:

$\quad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad b_2 (t_2^2 ) = (2,t_1^{2})$

Consequently, the first player will choose his choice "2", if he
believes that second player will choose "2" with the probability 1. In a
similar way, the second player will choose "2", if he believes that
first player will choose "2" with the probability 1 and they will end up
getting two units of money each.

# Conclusion

Game theory has been investigated with epistemic approaches in recent
years. Theorists and practitioners do research for analyzing the logic
underlying game theory in a broader and more realistic perspective.
Although epistemic game theory has a strong theoretical background,
there is a lack of tools to work on large-scale problems in practice.
This study based on common belief in rationality which can be considered
as the heart of epistemic game theory. In two-player games, we developed
a systematic way to find out types that optimize their rational choices
under common belief in rationality for every player together with
maximizing their utility. Thus, this study brings flexibility to
producing solutions of large-scale problems within the scope of
epistemic game theory. The algorithms which have been used are
transformed into software. R is preferred because of its open-source
software feature, and an R package has been created to bring the program
into use. It is thought that this study will serve as an example for
future work in computational epistemic game theory field and it is
planned to adapt this approach to $n$-person games as well.
