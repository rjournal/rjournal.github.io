title: 'Code Profiling in R: A Review of Existing Methods and an Introduction to Package
  GUIProfiler'
abstract: Code analysis tools are crucial to understand program behavior. Profile
  tools use the results of time measurements in the execution of a program to gain
  this understanding and thus help in the optimization of the code. In this paper,
  we review the different available packages to profile R code and show the advantages
  and disadvantages of each of them. In additon, we present GUIProfiler, a package
  that fulfills some unmet needs. Package GUIProfiler generates an HTML report with
  the timing for each code line and the relationships between different functions.
  This package mimics the behavior of the MATLAB profiler. The HTML report includes
  information on the time spent on each of the lines of the profiled code (the slowest
  code is highlighted). If the package is used within the RStudio environment, the
  user can navigate across the bottlenecks in the code and open the editor to modify
  the lines of code where more time is spent. It is also possible to edit the code
  using Notepad++ (a free editor for Windows) by simply clicking on the corresponding
  line. The graphical user interface makes it easy to identify the specific lines
  which slow down the code. The integration in RStudio and the generation of an HTML
  report makes GUIProfiler a very convenient tool to perform code optimization.
