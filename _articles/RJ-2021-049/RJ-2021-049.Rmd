title: Analyzing Dependence between Point Processes in Time Using IndTestPP
abstract: The need to analyze the dependence between two or more point processes in
  time appears in many modeling problems related to the occurrence of events, such
  as the occurrence of climate events at different spatial locations or synchrony
  detection in spike train analysis. The package *IndTestPP* provides a general framework
  for all the steps in this type of analysis, and one of its main features is the
  implementation of three families of tests to study independence given the intensities
  of the processes, which are not only useful to assess independence but also to identify
  factors causing dependence. The package also includes functions for generating different
  types of dependent point processes, and implements computational statistical inference
  tools using them. An application to characterize the dependence between the occurrence
  of extreme heat events in three Spanish locations using the package is shown.

# Introduction

A point process in time (PP in short) is a random collection of points
in a space in $\mathbb{R}^+$ where each point usually represents the
time of an event. Examples of events that can be modeled as point
processes in time include the occurrence of earthquakes, heat waves, or
the arrivals of insurance claims. Many real problems involve not one but
two or more PPs, and they should be studied in a multivariate framework
where a description of the independence or dependence structure between
them is required. Examples of these situations are the timing of the
trades and mid-quote changes in the stock exchange, the occurrence of
temperature extremes or other climate events at different spatial
locations, or the synchrony detection in spike train analysis.

In those situations, statistical tests are required to assess the
independence between two or more PPs. If we can assume that the
processes are independent, their modeling is much simpler, since it can
be carried out separately for each process without any loss of
information. The tests are also useful to identify the type of
dependence and select the type of vector of point processes used to
model them. The need of testing independence between PPs appears in
climate and environmental sciences [@Cronie16; @Abaurrea15], in
neuroscience [@Tuleau14; @Albert15], in biology [@Myllymaki17], and many
other fields.

Two types of independence between PPs may be of interest, general
independence [@Rubin14] and independence, given the intensities of the
processes. The election of the type of independence as null hypothesis
depends on the aim of the study, but the second type is more useful in
modeling problems based on PPs. In effect, the most frequent approach to
model systematic dependence structures caused by common factors is the
use of nonhomogeneous processes with intensities, which are functions of
the same or dependent covariates. To analyze if the dependence is well
represented by those covariates, the null hypothesis of independence
given the intensities has to be checked. When the existing dependence
cannot be explained by the available covariates, models taking into
account that dependence should be considered to model the vectors of
PPs.

The R package
[*IndTestPP*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=IndTestPP) [@IndTestPP]
provides a general framework for all the steps to analyze the dependence
in a vector of point processes in time: from data processing and tests
of independence to inference tools for parameters of interest. That
makes it a useful tool for applications based on the modeling of a
vector of point processes. As far as we know, there is not other
software for this type of analysis. One of the main features of the
package is the implementation of the three families of independence
tests by @Cebrian20, which cover a wide variety of homogeneous and
nonhomogeneous processes appearing in real problems: Poisson processes,
processes with a parametric marginal model, point processes with known
marginal intensities, etc. The package also provides functions to
generate four different models of dependent PPs, and two types of
independent PPs, which are useful to develop inference tools based on
computational statistical methods.

The outline of the paper is as follows. The two first sections *Vector
of point processes in time* and *Point processes in R* introduce some
properties for vectors of point processes and some R packages related to
this topic. The three following sections describe the implementation in
R of the tests of independence, the measures of dependence, and the
tools for generating PPs. The final section shows an illustrative
example of an analysis to characterize the dependence between the
occurrence of extreme heat events in three Spanish locations using
*IndTestPP*.

# Vectors of point processes in time {#VectorPP}

A point process in time, $N$, is defined in $\mathbb{R}^+$ and can be
described in different equivalent ways. Here, we will mainly use the
sequence of occurrence times, $T_1, T_2, ..., T_n$, and also the set of
random variables $N(A)$ representing the number of points in $A$, for
each $A \in  \mathbb{R}^+$. The notation for $A=(0, t]$ is
$N(t)=N((0,t])$. The intensity measure of the process $\Lambda$ gives
the expected number of points in a set, so that
$\Lambda((0,t])=E(N((0,t]))$. Its derivative function, provided it
exists, is the intensity function,
$$\lambda\left(t\right)=\frac{\partial \Lambda\left(\left(0, t\right]\right)}{\partial t}.$$

If the intensity is constant, the process is homogeneous and
nonhomogeneous otherwise. The most known PP is the Poisson process,
where $N(A)$ has a $Poisson(\mu_A)$ distribution, with
$\mu_A=\int_A \lambda(t) dt$, and $N(A_1), \ldots N(A_k)$ are
independent variables provided that
$A_i \cap A_j= \emptyset ,\ \  \forall i \ne j$.

Herein, we will consider vectors of point processes
$\mathbf{N}=(N_1, \ldots, N_d)$ observed in the same space
$\Omega=(0, T] \subset \mathbb{R}^+$. This definition must not be mixed
up with a multivariate point processes defined as a process of random
points $\mathbf{X_i}=(X_{i1},\ldots, X_{id})$ in a d-dimensional space
$V\in \mathbb{R}^d$, whose simplest example with $d=2$ is a spatial
point processes. Figure [1](#Fig1a) shows the differences between the
two concepts with $d=3$. A vector of PPs can be seen as a marked point
process with discrete marks, and can be represented by a countable
collection of pairs $(T_i, D_i)$ where $T_i \in \mathbb{R}^+$ are the
occurrence times and $D_i \in \{1, \ldots , d\}$ are the component
indexes.

Most of the results in this work are developed for vectors of $d=2$
processes, denoted by $(N_x, N_y)$ with intensities $\lambda_x(t)$ and
$\lambda_y(t)$. If the results can be extended to higher values of $d$,
it is specified. The $n_x$ and $n_y$ points in each observed process are
denoted $t_{1}, \ldots, t_{n_x}$ and $s_{1}, \ldots, s_{n_y}$,
respectively.

Many types of dependence structures can appear between the marginal
processes of a vector. The most direct way of modeling it is to use
models to represent the dependence between the occurrence times of the
processes, such as the common Poisson shock processes, the queue
processes, the Poisson processes with dependent marks, or the
multivariate Neyman-Scott processes, described later.

# Point processes in R {#Section3}

There exist many packages in R devoted to the analysis of spatial point
processes: the extensive
[*spatstat*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=spatstat) [@Baddeley15],
whose main functionalities include exploratory data analysis,
model-fitting, and simulation,
[*stpp*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=stpp) [@stpp],
[*splancs*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=splancs) [@splancs], and
many others.
[*IDSpatialStats*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=IDSpatialStats)
[@Giles19] provides spatial dependence measures, and future directions
include the extension to the spatio-temporal case. However, the number
of packages dealing with the analysis of point processes in time is not
so high, and most of them deal with univariate analysis of the
processes. [*NHPoisson*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=NHPoisson)
[@Cebrian15] provides a global framework for the modeling and diagnosis
of Poisson processes in time,
[*PtProcess*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=PtProcess) [@PtProcess]
fits and analyses time-dependent marked point processes with an emphasis
on earthquake modeling, and
[*mmpp*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=mmpp) [@mmpp] offers various
similarity and distance metrics for marked point processes.

The aim of *IndTestPP* is the analysis of vectors of point processes in
time, in particular of its dependence, and it provides a general
framework for all the steps involved in this type of analysis: data
processing, estimation of the marginal intensities of the processes,
analysis of independence given the intensity, identification of factors
causing dependence, and inference tools based on computational
statistics. [*mppa*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=mppa) [@mppa]
provides a test for dependence between point processes on the real line,
but with a different aim since it tests general independence. The three
families of tests implemented in *IndTestPP* are more general since they
are not restricted to Poisson processes, and they test independence
given the marginal intensities. This type of conditional independence is
more useful in statistical modeling of vectors of point processes since
it helps to identify the factors that cause the dependence. An example
of how all the steps of the modeling of a vector of point processes can
be carried out using *IndTestPP* is shown in the application section.

# Testing independence between point processes in time {#Section4}

Most of the analysis of independence between point processes in the
literature involve spatial processes, but few works deal with the study
of independence between processes in time. *IndTestPP* includes the
three families of tests to assess independence between PPs in time by
@Cebrian20, i.e., the POISSON, the CLOSE, and the CROSS families, and a
graphical tool, the Dutilleul plot. In all of them, the null hypothesis
is the independence between the point processes, given their marginal
intensities, and the alternative the existence of any type of random
dependence between them. All the tests in these families are constructed
by keeping fixed the first observed process, a common approach to test
independence given the marginal structure. However, each test is based
on different assumptions, and all together they cover a wide range of
types of processes appearing in real problems.

## POISSON family

The family of tests POISSON is implemented in the function `CondTest`,
and it includes two tests to assess the independence between two
homogeneous or nonhomogeneous processes, based on the conditional
distribution of $N_y |N_x$. The assumptions of the tests are that $N_y$
is a Poisson process with intensity function $\lambda_y(t)$, specified
in the vector argument `lambday`.

This family is based on the following property. If $N_x$ and $N_y$ are
independent, and a point $t_i$ occurs in $N_x$, the distribution of
$N_y$ does not change. Then, $Y_i$, the number of points in $N_y$ in
intervals $l_i$ of length $2r$ around $t_i$, follows a $Poisson(\mu_i)$
distribution with $\mu_i=\int_{l_i} \lambda_y(t) dt$.

Two options are available to perform a test. The test implemented with
the argument `type=’Poisson’` is based on the fact that under the
independence between $N_x$ and $N_y$ and if not overlapping intervals
are used, the statistic $Y=\sum_{i=1}^{n_x} Y_i$ has a $Poisson(\mu)$
distribution with $\mu=\sum_{i=1}^{n_x} \mu_i$. A test based on a Normal
approximation is implemented with the argument `type=’Normal’`. Again,
under the null and with not overlapping intervals, the variables
$(Y_i-\mu_i)/\sqrt{\mu_i}$ are zero mean independent variables with
standard deviation equal to 1, and the asymptotic distribution of the
statistic
$$O_{n_x}=  {1 \over \sqrt{n_x}}\sum_{j=1}^{n_x}{Y_j-\mu_j\over \sqrt{\mu_j}}$$
is $N(0,1)$. If the argument is `type=’All’`, both tests are calculated.

The intervals where the number of points is counted, $l_i$ , are
centered intervals around points $t_i$ of radius $r$ specified by the
argument `r`. If `changer=TRUE`, when two intervals overlap, their
lengths are shortened by half of the intersection period; in this way
the resulting intervals are disjoint and, consequently, the
corresponding variables $Y_i$ are independent.

The power study by @Cebrian20 shows that the Normal test performs better
provided that conditions to guarantee the normal approximation are
fulfilled. These conditions are quite weak, even with a complex
intensity, mean values of $\mu_i$ around 0.6 points per interval lead to
a valid approximation with $n_x=50$, and around 0.3 with $n_x=100$.

## CLOSE family {#CLOSEtests}

The CLOSE family includes two tests, the parametric bootstrap (PaB) and
the Lotwick-Silverman (LoS) tests, implemented in the functions
`TestIndNH` and `TestIndLS`, respectively. The LoS test can only be
applied to homogeneous processes, but the PaB test also to
nonhomogeneous ones. On the other hand, the LoS does not require any
assumption to be applied, while PaB requires that $N_y$ follows a
parametric model with a generation algorithm, such as a Poisson or a
Neyman-Scott cluster process. Although both tests allow checking the
independence between $d$ processes in general, the calculation of the
statistic is only implemented for $d=2$ and $d=3$.

These tests are based on the close point distance, and they aim to
compare the behavior of the sets of close points in a vector of observed
processes and in vectors with the same marginal distributions but
independent components [@Abaurrea15]. A point $s_j$ in $N_y$ is a close
point of $t_i$ in $N_x$ if the intervals to their previous points,
$s_{j-1}$ and $t_{i-1}$, overlap. The set behavior is summarized by
$\bar dx_i$, the mean of the distances between $t_i$ and its close
points, $|s_j-t_i|$. The set of close points and the mean distance for
each point $t_i$ are calculated by the functions `uniogentri` and
`DistObs`, respectively.

Given the complexity of the test statistic, its distribution has to be
obtained by computational statistical methods. These methods require
approaches to generate a sample of $r$ processes
$N^*_j=(N_{x}, N^*_{y,j})$, where the observed process $N_x$ is fixed,
$N^*_{y,j}$ has the same distribution as $N_y$, and $N_x$ and
$N^*_{y,j}$ are independent. The PaB and LoS tests result from two
different generation approaches.

**Parametric bootstrap test**. In this test, the $N_{y,j}^*$ processes
are generated independently from $N_x$ using a parametric model. Two
types of marginal models are implemented in *TestIndNH*: Poisson
processes (`type="Poisson"`) and Neyman-Scott cluster processes
(`type="PoissonCluster"`).The generation of Poisson processes in a given
period uses the function `simNHPc`, based on a two-step algorithm which
generates homogeneous occurrence times, and transform them into the
points of a NH process with intensity $\lambda(t)$ [@Ross06].
Neyman-Scott cluster processes are obtained by the function
`IndNHNeyScot`. Details about these processes are explained later.

**Lotwick-Silverman test (LoS)**. `TestIndLS` generates processes using
a Monte Carlo method conditional on the observed marginal structure
[@Lotwick82]. The steps are the following:

1.  The observed processes $(N_x, N_y)$ are wrapped onto a circumference
    by identifying the opposite sides of the time interval where they
    are observed.

2.  Fixing $N_x$, a new $N^*_y$ is generated by translating $N_y$ a
    random uniform amount on the circumference. This breaks any
    dependence between the processes and keeps the marginal
    distributions, provided they do not change over time.

The mean distances of the close point sets in the generated vectors of
processes in the PaB and the LoS tests are calculated by the functions
`DistSim` and `DistShift`, respectively. The calculation of the
*p*-value requires the generation of processes in two steps of the
algorithm, to calculate the expectation of the mean distances
$\bar dx_{ij}$ and to estimate the distribution of the statistic in a
correlated sample. This calculation is implemented so that the same
generated processes are used in the two steps and the computing time is
kept low; otherwise, it would be multiplied by the number of
simulations. Moreover, parallel computation is implemented.

According to the power study by @Cebrian20, both LoS and PaB tests have
high power, but LoS performs slightly better in the homogeneous
processes with small samples and low dependence.

## CROSS family

The CROSS family includes two tests based on the cross K and the cross J
spatial functions adapted to the case of PPs in time, implemented in the
functions `NHK` and `NHJ`, respectively. These functions also provide
estimators of the cross functions. They do not require any assumption
about the distribution of the marginal processes, only to know their
intensities, and the *p*-values are calculated using a LoS approach. The
tests can be applied to two homogeneous or nonhomogeneous processes, and
more generally to two sets of processes,
$\mathbf{C}=(N_{x1}, N_{x2}, \ldots, N_{xl_C})$ and
$\mathbf{D}=(N_{y1}, N_{y2}, \ldots, N_{yl_D})$. The information about
the processes is provided by arguments `posC`, a vector containing all
the occurrence times in the processes in $\mathbf{C}$, and `typeC`, a
vector containing the code $j$ of the process $N_{xj}$ where each point
in `posC` occurs; $\mathbf{D}$ is specified analogously by `posD` and
`typeD`. For the sake of simplicity, the results are expressed for the
case, $\mathbf{C}=(N_x)$ and $\mathbf{D}=(N_y)$ with intensities
$\lambda_x(t)$ and $\lambda_y(t)$.

#### K-function.

$K_{xy}(r)$ is the expected value of the number of points in $N_y$
within a distance $r$ of a randomly chosen point in $N_x$, adjusted for
the possible time-varying intensity. `NHK` calculates two different
estimators of $K_{xy}(r)$ at a given grid of $r$ distances, and the
corresponding test statistics based on them,
$\mathcal{K}=\frac{1}{R} \sum_{r=r_1}^{r_R}\hat K_{xy}(r)/2r$. The
estimator calculated by default (`typeEst = 2`) performs better in terms
of size and power [@Cebrian20].

#### J-function.

It compares the functions $D_{xy}(r)$ (distribution function of the
distances from a point in $N_x$ to the nearest point in $N_y$) and
$F_{y}(r)$ (distribution function of the distances from a point in the
space to the nearest point in $N_y$), in terms of the ratio
$J_{xy}(r)=(1-D_{xy}(r))/(1-F_{y}(r))$, if $F_{y}(r)<1$.

The estimators of $D_{xy}(r)$ and $F_{y}(r)$, calculated by `NHD` and
`NHF`, are used in `NHJ` to estimate $J_{xy}(r)$. To estimate
$F_{y}(r)$, a grid of $L$ values is required. It can be provided in
argument `L` or an automatic selection is calculated otherwise. In the
homogeneous PPs, the previous estimators are equal to the empirical
distribution functions, and the calculation algorithms are changed to
reduce the computational cost. The test statistic, which summarizes the
deviations of the function from 1, is
$\mathcal{J}=\frac{1}{R}\sum_{r=r_1}^{r_R}|\hat J_{xy}(r)-1|$.

In both functions, `NHK` and `NHJ`, the grid of $r$ distances where the
estimators are evaluated are provided in argument `r`. If it is NULL, an
automatic selection based on length $T$ is carried out. The test
statistics are also evaluated at that grid, and since dependence often
appears between close observations, the addends with high $r$ can make
it more difficult to discriminate between dependent and independent
processes. To avoid that effect, the statistic can be calculated using
only the addends with $r<r0$ by using the argument `rTest=r0`. To
identify an adequate value of $r0$, values $\hat K_{xy}(r)$ or
$\hat K_{xy}(r)/2r$ can be optionally plotted.

#### Computation of the *p*-values.

The calculation of the *p*-value in CROSS tests is based on a LoS
approach for nonhomogenous processes. First, the observed processes
$(N_x, N_y)$ are wrapped onto a circumference. Then, fixing $N_x$, a new
$N^*_y$ is generated by translating $N_y$ and its intensity
$\lambda_y(t)$, a random uniform amount. This breaks any dependence, but
in nonhomogeneous PPs, it changes the distribution of the marginal
processes. However, since the cross functions are adjusted for the
time-varying intensity, which is also translated, valid samples of
$K_{xy}(r)$ (or $J_{xy}(r)$) under independence are obtained. Using the
empirical distribution of those samples, the *p*-value and confidence
envelopes for $K_{xy}(r)$ (or $J_{xy}(r)$) are obtained. Parallel
computation is implemented for these calculations.

## Dutilleul plot

The function `DutilleulPlot` carries out Diggle's randomization testing
procedure extended by @Dutilleul11, which graphically assesses the
independence between two homogeneous or nonhomogeneous Poisson
processes, given their marginal structure. The idea is to plot the
cumulative relative frequency of the nearest neighbor distances between
the points in the two observed processes and to analyze the independence
using a confidence band calculated from simulated independent Poisson
processes with the observed marginal intensities.

# Dependence measures {#Section5}

Unfortunately, there does not exist a general definition to quantify the
dependence between two PPs. However, we suggest some measures
implemented in *IndtestPP* which can be useful to describe the level of
dependence between many types of processes.

**Correlation between the counting variables of two PPs**. `CountingCor`
calculates a sample estimator of $\rho_{xy}^{L}=Cor(X_{i}, Y_{i})$, the
correlation coefficient between $X_{i}$ and $Y_{i}$ the number of points
in processes $N_x$ and $N_y$, in an interval $l_i$ of length $L$, using
a partition of the observed period. Given the discrete character of
$X_{i}$ and $Y_{i}$, and since the usual aim is to quantify any type of
dependence, not only linear correlation, Spearman or Kendall
coefficients are often more adequate. Kendall should be preferred with
short intervals since there will be a high number of 0 or 1 occurrences
per interval, and the Kendall Tau-b coefficient implemented in the
function makes an adjustment for the ties.

In nonhomogenous processes, variables $X_{i}$ (and $Y_{i}$) in intervals
measured at different times are not i.d. In the case of Poisson
processes, `CountingCor` can calculate a standardized version of the
measure, so that all the variables have the same mean and variance, and
if $\Lambda_{x,i}= \sum_{t \in l_i}\lambda_x(t)$ and
$\Lambda_{y,i}= \sum_{t \in l_i}\lambda_y(t)$ are high enough, they are
also i.d.,

$$\rho_{xy}^L=Cor\left({X_{i}-\Lambda_{x,i} \over \sqrt{\Lambda_{x,i}}},   {Y_{i}-\Lambda _{y,i} \over \sqrt{\Lambda_{y,i}}}\right).$$
This coefficient measures the correlation given the marginal
intensities. That means that the coefficient measures the correlation
once that dependence captured by the intensities (through common
covariates, for example) has been removed.

**Percentage of concordant intervals.** A simpler descriptive measure is
the percentage of concordant intervals, that is, the percentage of
intervals with occurrences in both processes. It is calculated by
`BinPer` as $n_{x,y}/(n_{x,y}+n_{x,0}+ n_{0,y})$, where $n_{x,y}$ is the
number of intervals with at least one point in both processes, and
$n_{0,y}$ and $n_{x,0}$ are the number of intervals with at least one
point in one process and 0 in the other. This percentage will tend to be
zero in short intervals of independent processes, while positive values
will suggest positive dependence. An adequate length of interval that
depends on the marginal intensities has to be selected to obtain useful
interpretations.

**Extremal dependence coefficients.** In the case of PPs resulting from
a Peak over threshold (POT) approach, another interesting measure is the
extremal dependence between the variables $X$ and $Y$ where the POT
approach is applied. The extremal dependence is the tendency for one
variable to be large, given that the other one is large. The extremal
dependence coefficient $\chi$ of $X$ given $Y$ is defined as
$\chi_{x|y}= \lim_{u \to 1} \chi_{x|y}(u)$, where
$$\chi_{x|y}(u)= P\left(U>u |V>u\right),$$
and $(U,V)$ are the transformed uniform marginals of $X$ and $Y$.
Another extremal coefficient is
$\bar \chi_{x|y}= \lim_{u \to 1} \bar \chi_{x|y}(u)$, where

$$\bar \chi_{x|y}(u)= 2 \ {\log P\left(U>u\right) \over \log P\left(U>u, V>u\right)}-1.$$

$\chi_{x|y}$ is on the scale $[0, 1]$, with the set $(0, 1]$
corresponding to asymptotic dependence, and the measure
$\bar \chi_{x|y}$ falls within the range $[-1, 1]$, with $[-1, 1)$
corresponding to asymptotic independence. Thus, ($\chi_{x|y} > 0$,
$\bar \chi_{x|y} =1$) signifies asymptotic dependence, and the value of
$\chi$ determines the strength of dependence within that class;
($\chi_{x|y}=0$, $\bar \chi_{x|y} <1$) signifies asymptotic
independence, and $\bar \chi_{x|y}$ determines the strength of
dependence within that class. Full details can be found in @Coles99.

The function `depchi` estimates the functions $\chi_{x|y}(u)$ and
$\bar \chi_{x|y}(u)$ in a given grid of values $u$. Both $\chi_{x|y}(u)$
and $\chi_{y|x}(u)$ (or $\bar \chi_{x|y}(u)$ and $\bar \chi_{y|x}(u)$)
are calculated and optionally plotted. These graphs are useful to
estimate the limit of the function and obtain $\hat \chi_{x|y}$ (and
$\widehat{\bar \chi}_{x|y}$). In the plot of $\chi_{x|y}(u)$, the
expected behavior under independence is also plotted.

# Generating point processes with different dependence structures {#Section6}

The generation of vectors of PPs with a given dependence structure is
necessary to implement Monte Carlo, parametric bootstrap, or other
inference methods based on simulation, such as those described in
section *Inference based on computational statistical methods*. There
are different approaches to model the dependence between the marginal
processes in a vector of PPs, but the most direct way is to model the
dependence between the occurrence times of the processes. *IndTestPP*
includes functions for the generation of four types of vectors of
homogeneous or nonhomogeneous PPs, which will be described later in this
section: common Poisson shock processes, multivariate Neyman-Scott
processes, queue processes, and marked Poisson processes. These types of
vectors allow modeling three dependence structures frequently observed
in real problems.

-   *Dependence between two or more PPs provoked by the same shock
    triggering event*. This is the most common dependence structure and
    can be modeled by a common Poisson shock process (CPSP) or a
    multivariate Neyman-Scott process (MNSP). Both models show a
    short-term and positive dependence, generated by common shocks, but
    in each one, the shocks yield points in the processes in a different
    way. This dependence appears in the spike trains of two neurons, in
    climate and environmental processes, or in financial problems, for
    example, when a political crisis provokes the occurrence of large
    decreases in different economical indexes.
-   *Dependence between shifted processes*. This is a point-to-point
    dependence, where the occurrence of an event in a process triggers
    an event in the other so that the points in $N_x$ are shifted a
    positive random amount in $N_y$. It can be modeled by a queue or a
    network of queues (QUE). Examples of this type of dependence are the
    processes of the reporting and resolution times of insurance claims
    or the occurrence times of floods provoked by an event of intense
    rainfall.
-   *Dependence between neighbour points in different processes*. It
    appears when the occurrence of an event in one process boots or
    blocks the occurrence of an event in the others. It can be modeled
    by a marked Poisson process with dependent marks generated, for
    example, by a Markov chain (MPP). This model yields medium or
    long-term dependence, since given that the process of all the points
    is a Poisson process, a model of rare events, the distance between
    consecutive points tends to be large. An example of this type of
    dependence is the process of the growth of a species of plant, which
    favors or avoids the growth of another plant during a period of
    time.

## Common Poisson shock processes

The function `DepNHCPSP` generates $d$ dependent Poisson processes,
which are the marginal processes of a CPSP. A CPSP, see @Abaurrea15 for
full details, is a multivariate PP with an underlying Poisson process of
shocks, $N_0$, which may yield a point in one or more of $d$ marginal
processes $N_j$. These marginal processes are dependent Poisson
processes, where the dependence between $N_i$ and $N_j$ only comes from
the occurrence of simultaneous points in those processes.

**Generation algorithm.** The CPSPs show a property which
straightforwardly leads to a generation algorithm: they can be
decomposed into $m$ independent Poisson processes, with
$m=\sum_{k=1}^d {d \choose k}$. The $m$ indicator processes are the
processes of the points occurring only in $N_{1}$, \..., only in
$N_{d}$, simultaneously only in $N_{1}$ and $N_2$, \..., simultaneously
only in $N_{1}$, $N_2$, and $N_3$,\..., and finally, simultaneously in
$N_{1}$, $N_2$,\... and $N_d$. For example, a CPSP with $d=2$ is
decomposed into three independent indicator processes, $N_{(1)}$,
$N_{(2)}$, and $N_{(12)}$, with intensities $\lambda_{(1)}$,
$\lambda_{(2)}$, and $\lambda_{(12)}$. Each marginal process $N_j$ can
be expressed as the sum of all the indicator processes including the
index $j$, and its intensity is the sum of the indicator intensities. In
the case $d=2$, $N_{1}=N_{(1)}+ N_{(12)}$, $N_{2}=N_{(2)}+ N_{(12)}$,
$\lambda_1=\lambda_{(1)}+\lambda_{(12)}$, and
$\lambda_2=\lambda_{(2)}+\lambda_{(12)}$. Then, $d$ dependent Poisson
processes can be generated in two steps.

1.  Generation of $m$ independent Poisson processes $N_{(1)}$,
    $N_{(2)}$,\..., $N_{(12)}$,\... and $N_{(12...d)}$, with the
    adequate intensities, using the function `simNHPc`.

2.  Each $N_j$ is obtained as the union of the points in the indicator
    processes with index $j$, $N_{(.j.)}$.

The intensity of the processes to be generated with `DepNHCPSP` is
specified in argument `lambdaiM`, a matrix whose columns are the
intensity vectors of the indicator processes. Independent Poisson
processes in the same period of time cannot be generated using
`DepNHCPSP` but with `IndNHPP`.

**Estimation**. It is simple since it reduces to the identification of
the indicator processes and the estimation of $m$ independent Poisson
processes. In the case $d=2$, `CPSPpoints` identifies the three
indicator processes, using as input the points in the two marginal
processes. The related function `CPSPPOTevents` calculates the
occurrence times, length, maximum, and mean intensity of the extreme
events of the indicator processes of the CPSP resulting from a POT
approach. The marginal and indicator processes of a CPSP are plotted by
the functions `PlotMCPSP` and `PlotICPSP`, respectively. Poisson
processes can be fitted to the indicator processes using the package
*NHPoisson*.

## Multivariate Neyman-Scott processes {#SecMNS}

The function `DepNHNeyScot` generates $d$ dependent PPs, which are the
marginal processes of an MNSP. A Neyman-Scott process (NSP) is a process
of clusters of points such that the cluster centers $C_i$ are a Poisson
process, the number of points in each cluster, $Z_i$, are independent
Poisson variables possibly with different means $\mu_{i}$, and the
distances of each point $t_j$ in a cluster to its cluster center,
$D_{ij}$, are i.i.d. variables. We call a multivariate NSP to a vector
of NSP with the same cluster centers. The marginal processes are
dependent processes, but they are not Poisson.

**Generation algorithm.** The previous definition leads to the following
generation algorithm.

1.  A Poisson process with a given intensity is generated to obtain the
    cluster centers $C_i$.

2.  Given the number of generated cluster centers $J$, independent
    series of the number of points in each cluster, $(Z_i^l)$ for
    $i=1,\ldots, J$, for each marginal process $l$ with $l=1,\ldots, d$,
    are generated using Poisson distributions.

3.  Given the series $(Z_i^l)$, independent distances $D_{ij}^l$ to the
    cluster center $C_i$ for $j=1,\ldots, Z_i^l$, $i=1,\ldots, J$ are
    generated for each marginal process $l$. The points in each marginal
    process are obtained as $C_i+D_{ij}^l$.

`DepNHNeyScot` implements two common distributions to model the
distances from the points to the cluster center, $N(0, \sigma)$ or
$U(min, max)$. High values of $\sigma$ or the range $(max-min)$ lead to
a high variability around the center and to a lower dependence between
the processes. Independent NSP in the same period of time cannot be
generated using `DepNHNeyScot`, but with `IndNHNeyScot`.

This is the only model whose estimation is not easy, since the cluster
centers are usually unobserved, and they are required to estimate both
the underlying Poisson process and the distances of the points in each
cluster to its cluster center.

## Queue processes

`DepNHPPqueue` generates $d$ dependent Poisson processes using $d-1$
queues in a tandem. A queue models the input and output times of a
customer in a waiting line. In a tandem of queues, the servers are lined
up one behind the other so that an arriving customer undergoes each
server before leaving the system. `DepNHPPqueue` generates all the
intermediate processes in a tandem where the first queue can be
$M(t)\setminus G\setminus 1$ or $M(t) \setminus G \setminus \infty$,
that is, a queue where the input is a nonhomogeneous Poisson process,
service times have a general distribution $G$, and there are one or
infinity servers.

**Generation algorithm.** The generation of homogeneous PPs is based on
Burke's theorem stating that if the input of a queue is a homogeneous
Poisson process, the output is a dependent Poisson process with the same
intensity $\lambda$. @Keilson94 stated that if the input is a
nonhomogeneous Poisson process, the output is a Poisson process whose
intensity is the convolution $\lambda_{out}(t)=\lambda(t)*g(t)$, where
$g(t)$ is the density function of $G$. Then, the generation algorithm
is:

1.  Generation of the input process using a Poisson process with
    intensity $\lambda(t)$.

2.  Generation of independent time services $s_k$ with distribution $G$
    for each point $i_k$ in the input process.

3.  Generation of the output process using the generated input points
    and time services. If there is only one server, the output times
    $o_k$ depend on the state of the queue: it is $o_k=o_{k-1}+s_k$ if
    the queue is not empty (that is if $o_{k-1}> i_k$), and
    $o_k=i_{k}+s_k$ otherwise. If there are infinity servers, there are
    no queues, and $o_k=i_{k}+s_k$.

4.  The resulting output process is the input process of the following
    queue.

Steps 2 to 4 are repeated up to obtain $d$ dependent Poisson processes.

The distribution $G$ may be any distribution in
[*stats*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=stats); see
`Distributions`. The length of the argument `lambda` fixes $T$, the
length of the observed period, although in the homogeneous processes, we
can fix the number of points to be generated instead (argument `nEv`).
The vector of the output intensities $\lambda_{out}(t)$ is part of the
output of the function. It is expected that low $\lambda(t)$ values and
mean serving times lead to short queues and, consequently, high
dependence between processes.

**Estimation**. Since the marginal processes are Poisson, they can be
fitted and modeled using the package *NHPoisson*. Additionally, if the
connection between the input and output points is known, the service
times are the difference between them, and their distribution can be
also easily estimated.

## Marked Poisson processes with dependent marks

`DepNHPPMarked` generates $d$ dependent processes, which are the
marginal processes of an MPP with marks generated by a d-state Markov
chain. An MPP is a Poisson process in which a variable, called a mark,
is attached to each point. In this case, the marks are discrete
variables taking values in $\{1, \ldots, d\}$, which determine in which
of the $d$ marginal processes $N_j$, a point occurs. Given the Markov
chain structure, defined by a transition matrix $P=(p_{ij})$, only
adjacent marks are dependent. The marginal processes are Poisson if and
only if the marks are independent.

**Generation algorithm.** Applying the previous definition, the
generation of algorithm is simple.

1.  Generation of the points in a Poisson process with a given intensity
    $\lambda(t)$.

2.  Generation of marks by a Markov chain. It implies an iterative
    generation of values in $1, \ldots, d$, given the previous mark,
    using a multinomial distribution with probabilities given by $P$.

3.  Each marginal process $N_j$ includes the points in the Poisson
    process with marks $j$.

`SpecGap` calculates the spectral gap, a measure of the dependence
generated by a Markov chain, which assesses the convergence speed of the
transition matrix to a matrix with the same stationary distribution and
equal rows (that is, with independent marks). Processes with a lower
spectral gap yield more dependent marginal processes. Independent
Poisson processes can be generated using `IndNHPP` or a transition
matrix with equal rows in `DepNHPPMarked`.

**Estimation**. Given that the process of all the points in the marginal
processes is Poisson, $\lambda(t)$ can be estimated using *NHPoisson*.
`TranM` estimates the transition matrix of the Markov chain using the
MLE based on count data. Then, the estimators of the marginal
intensities are
$\hat \lambda_j(t)=\hat \lambda(t) \sum_{i=1}^d \hat p_{ij}$.

# Inference based on computational statistical methods []{#SecInfSim label="SecInfSim"}

There are many parameters of potential interest in a vector of point
processes, where inference tools based on exact or asymptotic
distributions are not available. Inference based on computational
statistical methods such as Monte Carlo (MC) or parametric bootstrap is
a useful alternative in those cases. `IntMPP` uses these methods to
implement point estimation and calculation of confidence intervals and
envelopes of a parameter, or vector of parameters, related to a vector
of PPs. The only requirement for the parameters of interest is that it
must be possible to estimate them from the observed processes. Some
examples are the vector of the number of points in each process in a
given time period or the time of occurrence of the k-th point in the
vector.

The idea to construct confidence intervals or envelopes using
computational statistical methods is simple when the distribution of the
vector of processes is completely known (Monte Carlo approach). In real
problems, the parameters of the distribution of the vector of processes
are rarely known, and parametric bootstrap methods, where the parameters
are estimated from the sample, have to be used. The basic idea is to
generate a sample of $n_s$ vectors of processes with the distribution. A
value of the statistic of interest is calculated from each generated
vector so that a sample of size $n_s$ of values of the statistic is
obtained. The lower and upper bounds of an interval with a $(1-\alpha)$%
confidence level are the $\alpha /2$ and $1-\alpha/2$ quantiles of the
generated sample, and the point estimator is the sample mean. Standard
tests of hypothesis can be implemented using those intervals in the
usual way.

The two main arguments of `IntMPP` are `fun.name`, a function to define
the estimator of the parameter, and `funMPP.name`, a model to generate
the vectors of processes. The estimator in `fun.name` must be a function
of the points in the vector of PPs (defined as a list which must be the
first argument of the function) and any number of additional arguments
provided by argument `fun.args`. The models in `funMPP.name` can be
`DepNHCPSP`, `DepNHPNeyScot`, `DepNHqueue`, and `DepNHPPMarked`, or any
other implemented by the user. The only requirement of those models is
that the first element in the output has to be a list with $d$ elements
defining the vector of PPs. Additional arguments for the models are
given in `funMPP.args`. Parallel computation is implemented in this
function.

# Analysis of the occurrence of extreme heat events in three locations using *IndTestPP* {#Section7}

This section illustrates how the package *IndTestPP* can be used to
carry out all the steps in the analysis of the occurrence of the extreme
heat events (EHEs) in three Spanish locations, Barcelona (B), Zaragoza
(Z), and Huesca (H) using a vector of point processes.

## Data

The series $TxB$, $TxH$, and $TxZ$ are the daily maximum temperature, in
Celsius degrees, during the warm season (May to September) from 1951 to
2016 at Barcelona, Huesca, and Zaragoza, respectively. The series were
provided by the Spanish Meteorological Office (AEMET), and they are
stored in the data frame $TxBHZ$ in the data set `TxBHZ`, available in
the package. The days which are not observed in the three series are
considered as missing observations so that three series with 8262
complete observations are available. The date ($day$, $month$, and
$year$), day within year ($dayyear$) of the observations, and some
variables representing the general temperature evolution are also
available in the data set. The three locations are sited in a triangle
where Barcelona is in the East, around 250km away from the others, and
Huesca is 67 km to the North of Zaragoza.

Using the peak over threshold (POT) approach, an EHE is defined as a run
of consecutive days where the temperature is over an extreme threshold,
and its occurrence point is the day of maximum temperature in the run.
The threshold is the 95$^{th}$ percentile of the series in a reference
period (months of June, July, and August in 1981-2010), being 31.3,
36.4, and 37.8$^{\circ}$ C in Barcelona, Huesca, and Zaragoza,
respectively. The series are recorded at a discrete time scale, but
given that the time unit is short compared with the length of the
observed period and that the occurrence intensity of EHEs is quite low,
the use of the continuous point processes to model the occurrence of
EHEs in a series is justified. The EHEs may affect the three locations
depending on the type of atmospheric situations that caused them. Then,
our aim is to model the occurrence of the EHEs in the three series using
a vector of point processes which take into account the dependence
between them and identify the factors causing that dependence.

## Processing data and preliminary analysis

To identify the occurrence times of the EHEs in a series using the POT
approach, the function `POTevents.fun` in *NHPoisson* is used. The case
of Zaragoza is shown as an example, and their 104 occurrence times are
stored in $posZ$. Analogously, the 106 and 121 occurrences in Barcelona
and Huesca are stored in $posB$ and $posH$.

``` r
R> library(NHPoisson)
R> library(IndTestPP)
R> data(TxBHZ)
R> attach(TxBHZ)

R> auxZ<-POTevents.fun(TxZ, thres=37.8)

  Number of events:  104
  Number of excesses over threshold 37.8 : 176

R>  posZ<-auxZ$Px
```

Then, `PlotMargP` is used to plot the points in the three processes:

``` r
R> T<-length(TxZ)
R> PlotMargP(list(posB, posH, posZ), T=T, cex.axis=0.6,cex=0.6, 
             cex.main=0.7, cex.lab=0.7)
```

![Figure 2: Plot from `PlotMargP`: Point processes of the occurrences
times of the EHEs in Barcelona ($N1$), Huesca ($N2$), and Zaragoza
($N3$).](figure/Sev1-1.png){#texorfig:1 width="100%"
alt="graphic without alt text"}

The temperature series are highly correlated, with Pearson coefficients
$\rho_{BH}=0.76$, $\rho_{BZ}=0.73$, and $\rho_{HZ}=0.94$, but to measure
their extremal dependence, a more specific measure, such as the extremal
dependence coefficients are used. The functions for the analysis between
$TxZ$ and $TxB$ are shown as an example, but the pairwise dependence
between the three locations is analyzed.

``` r
R> aux<-depchi(TxB,TxZ,indgraph=FALSE,xlegend='topright',
               thresval=c(9000:9975)/10000)
```

![Figure 3: Plots from `depchi` of $\hat \chi_{x|y}(u)$ and
$\hat{\bar \chi}_{x|y}(u)$ to estimate the extremal dependence
coefficients.](figure/Sev2-1.png){#texorfig:2 width="100%"
alt="graphic without alt text"}

The estimators $\hat \chi_{B|Z}=\hat \chi_{Z|B}=0$ and
$\hat{\bar \chi}_{B|Z}=\hat{\bar \chi}_{Z|B}=0.5$ suggest an asymptotic
independence between $TxB$ and $TxZ$. However, $\hat{\bar \chi}_{Z|B}>0$
suggests dependence at extreme levels, in particular in the threshold
$\hat  \chi_{Z|B}(0.95) \approx 0.38$. Similar conclusions are obtained
for $TxB$ and $TxH$, while $TxH$ and $TxZ$ are asymptotically dependent,
with $\hat \chi_{H|Z}=\hat \chi_{Z|H}=0.5$,
$\hat{\bar \chi}_{Z|H}=\hat{\bar \chi}_{H|H}=1$, and
$\hat  \chi_{Z|H}(0.95) \approx 0.7$.

The functions `CountingCor` and `BinPer` calculate another extremal
dependence measures, the correlation coefficient between the number of
EHEs in intervals of a given length $ll$, and the percentage of
concordant intervals,

``` r
R> aux<-CountingCor(posB,posZ, ll=10, T=T, method='kendall')
R> aux

  tau 
  0.3554213  

R> aux<-BinPer(posB,posZ, ll=10, T=T)

  Percentage of concordant intervals:  0.272
```

with $ll=10$ days, to measure short-term dependence. All the
correlations, $\varrho_{BZ}^{10}=0.36$, $\varrho_{BH}^{10}=0.33$, and
$\varrho_{ZH}^{10}=0.68$ are significantly different from zero. Similar
conclusions are provided by the percentage of concordant intervals,
$BP_{BZ}^{10}=0.27$, $BP_{BH}^{10}=0.25$, and $BP_{ZH}^{10}=0.55$.

The dependence given the empirical intensity of one process (obtained by
function `emplambda.fun` in *NHPoisson*) can be graphically analyzed
using the Dutilleul plot. Figure [4](#FigDutilleul1) shows the plot for
Zaragoza-Barcelona, resulting from the following commands, and the plots
for Barcelona-Huesca and Zaragoza-Huesca. All the previous results and
the plots show that there exists a pairwise dependence between the three
locations and that it is stronger between Zaragoza and Huesca.

``` r
R> lambdaEB<-emplambda.fun(posE=posB, t=c(1:T), lint=100, plot=F)$emplambda
R> aux<-DutilleulPlot(posZ, posB, lambdaEB, main="Zaragoza-Barcelona")
```

three locations, given the empirical
intensities.](figure/Sev5-1.png){#FigDutilleul1 width="100%"
alt="graphic without alt text"}

## Testing independence and analyzing dependence factors

Our next aim is to identify the factors which cause the dependence. To
that end, the independence tests given the marginal intensities are
applied. The first step is to model each process individually. This has
a twofold objective: first, to identify the factors that influence the
occurrence of EHEs in each series, which may cause the dependence, and
second to estimate the marginal intensities of the processes. The second
step is to check if the occurrence processes are independent given the
fitted intensities. If the tests do not reject the null hypothesis, it
can be concluded that the dependence between the EHE processes is
explained by the considered covariates since once its effect is removed,
the processes are independent. The rejection of independence gives
evidence that there are other non-identified factors causing dependence,
which have not been included as predictors in the intensities. In those
cases, a multivariate model allowing dependence should be used.

Step 1. To model the occurrence of the EHEs in each series, we consider
a nonhomogeneous Poisson process with an intensity that is a function of
a harmonic term (to model the seasonal behavior) and the available
covariate, which represents the local atmospheric situation
[@Abaurrea15]. After the modeling process, based on a likelihood ratio
test, the harmonic term, the covariate, and the squared covariate are
selected in Zaragoza. The same terms are included in Huesca, and the
same plus interaction between the covariate and the harmonic in
Barcelona. These models are fitted using `fitPP.fun` in *NHPoisson*. The
fit of Zaragoza is shown as an example, and the others are carried
analogously to obtain $lambdaH$ and $lambdaB$.

``` r
R> ss<-sin(2*pi*dayyear/366)
R> cc<-cos(2*pi*dayyear/366)
R> covZ<-cbind(ss,cc, Txm15Z, Txm15Z**2 )
R> dimnames(covZ)<-list(NULL, c("Sin", "Cos", "Txm15", "Txm152"))
R> ModZ<-fitPP.fun(covariates = covZ, posE = posZ,  inddat = auxZ$inddat,
               dplot=F, tit = "Sin+Cos+Txm15+Txm152", 
               start = list(b0 = 1, b1=-1,b2=1, b3=0, b4=0))

  Number of observations  not used in the estimation process:  72
  Total number of time observations:  8262
  Number of events:  104
  Convergence code:  0
  Convergence attained
  Loglikelihood:  -430.087
   
  Estimated coefficients: 
          b0      b1      b2      b3      b4 
     -54.209   0.190  -2.496   2.434  -0.029  
  Full coefficients: 
          b0      b1      b2      b3      b4 
     -54.209   0.190  -2.496   2.434  -0.029 
  attr(,"TypeCoeff")
  [1] "Fixed: No  fixed parameters"

R> lambdaZ<-ModZ@lambdafit
```

The three fitted models are satisfactorily validated using
`globalval.fun` in *NHPoisson*.

Step 2. The independence tests are used to study the pairwise
independence given the fitted intensities. Since it can be assumed that
the marginal processes are Poisson, the three families of tests POISSON,
CLOSE, and CROSS can be applied. In the CLOSE family, only the PaB test
is applied since the processes are nonhomogeneous; in the others, the
most powerful test, according to @Cebrian20, is selected, that is the
Normal test and the $K$ test. Only the functions for the analysis
between $TxZ$ and $TxB$ are shown, but all the pairwise comparisons are
summarized in Table [1](#Table8).

**POISSON family**. The Normal test is applied using an interval length
$r=15$ that guarantees the Normal approximation of the statistic.

``` r
R> aux<-CondTest(posZ, posB, lambday=lambdaB, r=15)

  WARNING: there are overlapping intervals. The independence hypothesis 
           is not guaranteed.
  The intervals have been shortened to obtain disjoint  intervals.
  The length of the intersection priods are:

  The shortest length of the considered intervals is:  3
  The median of the mui values is:  0.5

       0.6859921
```

**CLOSE family**. In the PaB test, the parametric marginal model of the
second process, the Poisson process fitted to Barcelona in this case,
has to be specified.

``` r
R> PBZB<-TestIndNH(posZ, posB, nsim = 5000, type = "Poisson", 
         lambdaMarg =cbind(lambdaB), fixed.seed=35)
R> PBZB$pv  

  p-value 
     0.2107578 
```

**CROSS family**. The $K$ test is implemented using an $r$-grid with
values from 1 to 15, the value selected with the help of the plot of the
estimated $K(r)$. Both the *p*-value and Figure [5](#FigK) suggest the
independence between Z-B given the intensities, since all the values
$\hat K(r)$ lie inside the confidence band. On the other hand, the plot
for Z-H, also shown in Figure [5](#FigK), rejects independence for
short-term dependence.

``` r
R> auxZB<-NHK(lambdaZ, lambdaB, posC=posZ, posD=posB, r=c(1:15), 
          typePlot='Kfun', cores=2,fixed.seed=36)

</figure>

Table [1](#Table8) summarizes the three pairwise comparisons. The three
tests lead to the non-rejection of independence between the occurrences
in B-Z, and to the rejection between Z-H. On the other hand, in pair
B-H, the $K$ test rejects the null while all the other tests do not. It
is found that the high value of the K statistic is only due to the
occurrence of a point in Huesca in $t=901$ and in Barcelona in $t=902$
when the intensity in both locations is low. In order to analyze the
influence of this event, the point in Barcelona is removed, and the
resulting *p*-value, 0.29, does not reject the independence anymore.
This suggests that the $K$ test is more sensitive than the others to the
existence of an influential point. Given that all the tests are built by
conditioning on the occurrences of the first process, the tests are also
applied, changing the order of the locations, and the same conclusions
are obtained.

Then, we conclude that, given the fitted intensities, the occurrence of
the EHEs in Zaragoza-Barcelona and Barcelona-Huesca are independent,
while there is dependence not explained by the covariates in
Zaragoza-Huesca, which are the closest locations. Given these results,
the best model for Barcelona is the previously fitted model, while the
occurrence processes of Huesca and Zaragoza should be modeled by a
vector of PPs taking into account the dependence between them. A model
that allows us to include that dependence is a CPSP. The occurrences of
the three indicator processes, the process of the events only in Huesca,
only in Zaragoza, and the simultaneous events, are obtained by the
function `CPSPPOTevents`. Then, the CPSP can be estimated by fitting a
Poisson process to each of the three indicator processes using
`fitPP.fun`; see @Cebrian15 for some examples.

## Inference based on computational statistical methods

This section shows two examples of inference based on computational
statistical tools using the function `IntMPP`. The first example uses
the CPSP, which models the occurrence of EHEs in Huesca and Zaragoza,
taking into account the dependence between them. It is fitted using
*NHPoisson*, and the estimated intensities of the three indicator
processes are the three last elements of the data.frame `TxBHZ`,
`lambdaOZ`, `lambdaOH`, and `lambdaZH`.

In the first example, we calculate the point estimate and a confidence
interval of the time of the first EHE in Zaragoza or Huesca. We need the
function `firstt`, whose output is the minimum occurrence time in a
vector of processes.

``` r
R> firstt<-function(posNH){minpos<-min(unlist(posNH))}
R> lambdaiZH<-cbind(lambdaOZ,lambdaOH,lambdaZH)
R> aux<-IntMPP(funMPP.name="DepNHCPSP", 
       funMPP.args=list(lambdaiM=lambdaiZH, d=2, dplot=F), 
       fun.name="firstt", fun.args=NULL, clevel=0.95, cores=2, fixed.seed=125) 

  Lower  bound  of CI:  50.4648
  Point estimator:  116.7493
  Upper bound of CI:  233.4015
```

This type of inference also allows us to obtain confidence bands for two
or more values, for example, the number of EHEs in Huesca and in
Zaragoza in a given time interval $I$. To that end, we use the function
`NumI`, included in the package, whose output is a vector containing the
number of points in an interval $I$ in each marginal process of a vector
of processes. To see the evolution of the number of extremes, we
consider two intervals, the three first and the three last years of the
period. A clear increase in the number of EHEs is observed in the two
locations.

``` r
R> aux<-IntMPP(funMPP.name="DepNHCPSP", 
        funMPP.args=list(lambdaiM=lambdaiZH, d=2, dplot=F),
        fun.name="NumI", fun.args=list(I=c(1,459)),  fixed.seed=125)

  Lower  bound  of CI:  1 1
  Point estimator:  3.058 3.765
  Upper bound of CI:  6 7

R> aux<-IntMPP(funMPP.name="DepNHCPSP", 
         funMPP.args=list(lambdaiM=lambdaiZH, d=2, dplot=FALSE),
         fun.name="NumI", fun.args=list(I=c(7803,8262)), fixed.seed=125)

  Lower  bound  of CI:  9 10
  Point estimator:  15.269 16.952
  Upper bound of CI:  22 24
```

## Simulating and characterizing vectors of processes 

In this section, some of the tools to generate vectors of processes in
*IndTestPP* are used to characterize the effect of the dependence in the
distribution of the nearest distances between two-point processes. To
that end, two dependent processes with a given dependence structure and
two independent processes with the same marginal distribution that the
previous ones are generated. The distributions of the samples of nearest
distances are compared using histograms and qqplots.

We generate two dependent Neyman-Scott processes using `DepNHNeyScot`,
with mean cluster size equal to 3 and 4, respectively, and $N(0,3)$ and
$N(0,2)$ distributions for the distances to the center. The independent
processes with the same marginal distribution are generated using
`IndNHNeyScot`. The distribution of the nearest distances is very
different in the two cases, as the qqplot shows. In the dependent
processes, it is concentrated in low values, while in the independent
ones the density decreases more smoothly.

``` r
R> set.seed(123)
R> lambdaParent<-runif(2000)/10

R> aux<-DepNHNeyScot(lambdaParent=lambdaParent, d=2, lambdaNumP=c(3,4), 
        dist="normal", sigmaC=c(3,2),fixed.seed=123, dplot=F)
R> posxd<- aux$posNH$N1
R> posyd<- aux$posNH$N2

R> aux<-IndNHNeyScot(lambdaParent=lambdaParent, d=2, lambdaNumP=c(3,4),
         dist = "normal", sigmaC=c(3,2), fixed.seed=123, dplot=F)
R> posxi<- aux$N1
R> posyi<- aux$N2

R> par(mfrow=c(1,3))
R> distxyd<-nearestdist(posxd , posyd)
R> hist(distxyd , main='Dependent processes', xlab='Nearest dist',
        xlim=c(0,60), ylim=c(0,270),breaks=seq(0,60, by=4) )
R> distxyi<-nearestdist(posxi , posyi)
R> hist(distxyi , main='Independent processes', xlab='Nearest dist',
        xlim=c(0,60), ylim=c(0,270),breaks=seq(0,60, by=4) )
R> qqplot(distxyi, distxyd, xlab='Independent processes', 
          ylab='Dependent processes')
R> lines(distxyd, distxyd, col="red")
```

# Conclusions

Many modeling problems related to the occurrence of events require to
analyze the dependence between two or more point processes in time.
However, not many tools to carry out this type of analysis are
available. *IndTestPP* provides a useful general framework for
applications based on the modeling of a vector of point processes in
time since it includes functions for processing data, estimating the
marginal intensities of the processes, testing independence, identifying
factors causing dependence, and making an inference. In particular, the
three families of independence tests by @Cebrian20 are implemented. They
are useful in different types of modeling problems since they cover a
wide variety of processes, homogeneous and nonhomogeneous, Poisson
processes, processes with a parametric marginal model, point processes
with known marginal intensities, etc. The package also provides
functions to generate four different types of vectors of point
processes, Common Poisson Shock processes, multivariate Neyman-Scott
cluster processes, Poisson processes from queues in a tandem, and
vectors of processes resulting from a marked Poisson process with
discrete marks from a Markov chain. These generation functions are used
to carry out inference based on computational statistical methods. The
applicability of the package in real modeling problems is shown by
analyzing the dependence between the occurrence of extreme temperature
events in three Spanish locations, Zaragoza, Barcelona, and Huesca.
