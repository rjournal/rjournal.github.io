title: Analyzing Dependence between Point Processes in Time Using IndTestPP
abstract: The need to analyze the dependence between two or more point processes in
  time appears in many modeling problems related to the occurrence of events, such
  as the occurrence of climate events at different spatial locations or synchrony
  detection in spike train analysis. The package IndTestPP provides a general framework
  for all the steps in this type of analysis, and one of its main features is the
  implementation of three families of tests to study independence given the intensities
  of the processes, which are not only useful to assess independence but also to identify
  factors causing dependence. The package also includes functions for generating different
  types of dependent point processes, and implements computational statistical inference
  tools using them. An application to characterize the dependence between the occurrence
  of extreme heat events in three Spanish locations using the package is shown.
