title: 'frailtyHL: A Package for Fitting Frailty Models with H-likelihood'
abstract: We present the frailtyHL package for fitting semi-parametric frailty models
  using h likelihood. This package allows lognormal or gamma frailties for random-effect
  distribution, and it fits shared or multilevel frailty models for correlated survival
  data. Functions are provided to format and summarize the frailtyHL results. The
  estimates of fixed effects and frailty parameters and their standard errors are
  calculated. We illustrate the use of our package with three well-known data sets
  and compare our results with various alternative R-procedures.
