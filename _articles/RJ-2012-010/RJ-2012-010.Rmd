# Introduction

Frailty models with a non-parametric baseline hazard have been widely
adopted for the analysis of survival data
[@R:Hougaard:2000; @R:Duchateau+Janssen:2008]. The
[*frailtyHL*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=frailtyHL) package
[@R:Ha+Noh+Lee:2012] implements h-likelihood procedures
[@R:Ha+Lee+Song:2001; @R:Ha+Lee:2003; @R:Ha+Lee:2005] for frailty
models. The package fits Cox proportional hazards models (PHMs) with
random effects, or frailties. The lognormal or gamma distribution can be
adopted as the frailty distribution, corresponding to the normal or
log-gamma distribution for the log frailties. H-likelihood obviates the
need for marginalization over the frailty distribution, thereby
providing a statistically efficient procedure for various random-effect
models [@R:Lee+Nelder+Pawitan:2006].

The main function is `frailtyHL()`. For instance,

``` r
> frailtyHL(Surv(time, status) ~ x + (1|id),
+           RandDist = "Normal", 
+           mord = 0, dord = 1,
+           Maxiter = 200, convergence = 10^-6,
+           varfixed = FALSE, varinit = 0.1)
```

fits a lognormal frailty model. The first argument is a formula object,
with the response on the left of a `~` operator, and the terms for the
fixed and random effects on the right. The response is a survival object
as returned by the `Surv` function [@R:Therneau:2011]. Here, `time` and
`status` denote survival time and censoring indicator taking value 1 or
0 for uncensored or censored observations, respectively; `x` denotes a
fixed covariate and `id` denotes the subject identifier. The expression
`(1|id)` specifies a random intercept model (`(x|id)` would specify a
random intercept, random slope model). The parameters `mord` and `dord`
are the orders of Laplace approximations to fit the mean parameters
(`mord` = 0 or 1) and the dispersion parameters (`dord` = 1 or 2),
respectively. The `Maxiter` parameter specifies the maximum number of
iterations and `convergence` specifies the tolerance of the convergence
criterion. If `varfixed` is specified as `TRUE` (or `FALSE`), the value
of one or more of the variance terms for the frailties is fixed (or
estimated) with starting value (e.g.Â 0.1) given by `varinit`.

Previously, frailty models have been implemented in several R functions
such as the `coxph()` function in the
[*survival*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=survival) package
[@R:Therneau:2010] and the `coxme()` function in the
[*coxme*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=coxme) package
[@R:Therneau:2011], based on penalized partial likelihood (PPL), the
`phmm()` function in the
[*phmm*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=phmm) package
[@R:Donohue+Xu:2012], based on a Monte Carlo EM (MCEM) method, and the
`frailtyPenal()` function in the
[*frailtypack*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=frailtypack) package
[@R:Gonzalez+Rondeau+Mazroui:2012], based on penalized marginal
likelihood. The *phmm* package fits one-component frailty models,
although it does allow multivariate frailties. The `coxme()` function
can fit the multi-component model as shown in Example 2. Results from
*frailtyHL* are compared with those from *survival*, *coxme* and *phmm*.

Recently, the h-likelihood procedures of @R:Lee+Nelder:1996 for fitting
hierarchical generalized linear models (HGLMs) have been implemented
using the `hglm()` function in the
[*hglm*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=hglm) package
[@R:Alam+Ronnegard+Shen:2010], the `HGLMfit()` function in the
[*HGLMMM*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=HGLMMM) package
[@R:Molas:2010] and the `dhglmfit()` function in the
[*dhglm*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=dhglm) package
[@R:Noh+Lee:2011]. The *frailtyHL* package is for fitting frailty models
with a non-parametric baseline hazard, providing estimates of fixed
effects, random effects, and variance components as well as their
standard errors. In addition, it provides a statistical test for the
variance components of frailties and also three AIC criteria for the
model selection.

# Frailty models

The *frailtyHL* package makes it possible to

1.  fit models with log-normal and gamma frailty distributions and

2.  estimate variance components when the frailty structure is shared or
    nested.

For illustration, we present two models below and show how to fit these
models using `frailtyHL()` in the **Examples** section.

## One-component frailty models

Suppose that data consist of right censored time-to-event observations
from $q$ subjects (or clusters), with $n_i$ observations each;
$i=1,\ldots ,q$. Let $T_{ij}$ be the survival time for the $j$th
observation of the $i$th subject; $j=1,\ldots ,n_{i}$. Here,
$n=\sum_{i} n_{i}$ is the total sample size and $n_i$ is the cluster
size. Let $C_{ij}$ be the corresponding censoring time and let
$y_{ij}=\mathrm{min} \{T_{ij},C_{ij}\}$ and $\delta
_{ij}=I(T_{ij}\leq C_{ij})$ be the observable random variables, where
$I(\cdot )$ is the indicator function.

Given the common unobserved frailty for the $i$th subject $u_{i}$, the
conditional hazard function of $T_{ij}$ is of the form

$$\lambda _{ij}(t|u_{i})=\lambda _{0}(t)\exp (x_{ij}^{T}\beta )u_{i},
\label{eq:1}   (\#eq:1)$$

where $\lambda _{0}(\cdot )$ is an unspecified baseline hazard function
and $\beta=(\beta_1, \ldots, \beta_p)^T$ is a vector of regression
parameters for the fixed covariates $x_{ij}$. Here, the term
$x_{ij}^{T}\beta$ does not include an intercept term because of
identifiability. Assume that the frailties $u_{i}$ are independent and
identically distributed (i.i.d) random variables with a frailty
parameter $\alpha$; the gamma and lognormal frailty models assume gamma
and lognormal distributions for $u_i$, respectively. That is, our
package allows

-   gamma frailty with $E(u_i)=1$ and $\mathrm{var}(u_i)=\alpha$, and
-   lognormal frailty having $v_i=\log u_i \sim N(0, \alpha)$.

The model represented by (1) is known as a shared or one-component
frailty model [@R:Hougaard:2000].

## Multi-component frailty models

We can fit a multi-component model as below [@R:Ha+Lee+MacKenzie:2007]:

$$X\beta +Z^{(1)}v^{(1)}+Z^{(2)}v^{(2)}+\cdots +Z^{(k)}v^{(k)},
\label{eq:2}   (\#eq:2)$$

$X$ is the $n\times p$ model matrix, $Z^{(r)}~(r=1,2,\ldots ,k)$ are the
$n\times q_{r}$ model matrices corresponding to the $q_{r}\times 1$
frailties $v^{(r)}$, and $v^{(r)}$ and $v^{(l)}$ are independent for
$r\neq l$.

For example, the CGD data [@R:Fleming+Harrington:1991] have a multilevel
structure in which patients nested within centers have recurrent
infection times.

Later, we analyze these data using model (2) with $k=2$. Here, the
frailty structures are:

::: center
$v^{(1)}$: center frailty $\sim N(0, \alpha_1 A_1)$,

$v^{(2)}$: patient frailty $\sim N(0, \alpha_2 A_2)$,
:::

where $A_{r}=I_{r}~(r=1,2)$ are the $q_{r}\times q_{r}$ identity
matrices, and $q_{1}$ and $q_{2}$ are the number of centers and
patients, respectively. Notice that the corresponding $Z^{(1)}$ to
$v^{(1)}$ (or $Z^{(2)}$ to $v^{(2)}$) is, respectively, a matrix of
indicator variables such that $Z_{st}^{(1)}=1$ (or $Z_{st}^{(2)}=1$) if
observation $s$ is a member of center (or patient) $t$ and 0 otherwise
[@R:Therneau+Grambsch:2000]. This is called the multilevel frailty model
[@R:Yau:2001; @R:Ha+Lee+MacKenzie:2007].

# H-likelihood theory

The h-likelihood $h$ [@R:Ha+Lee+Song:2001] for frailty model (1) is
defined by

$$h=h(\beta ,\lambda _{0},\alpha )=\ell _{0}+\ell _{1},
\label{eq:3}   (\#eq:3)$$

where
$$\begin{aligned}
\ell _{0} &= \sum_{ij}\log f(y_{ij},\delta _{ij}|u_{i};\beta ,\lambda_{0}) \\
         &= \sum_{ij}\delta _{ij}\{\log \lambda _{0}(y_{ij})+\eta _{ij}\} - 
               \sum_{ij}\Lambda_{0}(y_{ij})\exp (\eta _{ij})
\end{aligned}$$
is the sum of conditional log densities for $y_{ij}$ and $\delta
_{ij}$ given $u_{i}$, and
$$\ell _{1}=\sum_{i}\log f(v_{i};\alpha )$$
is the sum of log densities for $v_{i}=\log u_{i}$ with parameter
$\alpha$. Here, $\eta _{ij}=x_{ij}^{T}\beta +v_{i}$ is the linear
predictor for the hazards, and
$$\Lambda _{0}(t)=\int_{0}^{t}\lambda _{0}(k)dk$$
is the baseline cumulative hazard function.

The functional form of $\lambda _{0}(t)$ in (1) is unknown; following
@R:Breslow:1972, we consider $\Lambda _{0}(t)$ to be a step function
with jumps at the observed event times:
$$\Lambda _{0}(t)=\sum_{k:y_{(k)}\leq t}\lambda _{0k}$$
where $y_{(k)}$ is the $k$th ($k=1,\ldots ,l$) smallest distinct event
time among the $y_{ij}$'s, and ${\lambda }_{0k}=\lambda _{0}(y_{(k)})$.
However, the dimension of
$\lambda _{0}=(\lambda _{01},\ldots ,\lambda _{0l})^{T}$ increases with
the sample size $n$. For inference, @R:Ha+Lee+Song:2001 proposed the use
of the profile h-likelihood with $\lambda _{0}$ eliminated,
$h^{\ast }\equiv h|_{\lambda _{0}=\widehat{\lambda }_{0}}$, given by

$$h^{\ast }=h^{\ast }(\beta ,\alpha )=\ell _{0}^{\ast }+\ell _{1},
\label{eq:4}   (\#eq:4)$$

where
$$\begin{aligned}
\ell _{0}^{\ast } &= \sum_{ij}\log f^{\ast }(y_{ij},\delta_{ij}|u_{i};\beta )\\
                &= \sum_{ij}f(y_{ij},\delta _{ij}|u_{i};
                                \beta ,\widehat{\lambda }_{0})
\end{aligned}$$
does not depend on $\lambda _{0}$, and

$$\widehat{\lambda }_{0k}(\beta ,v)=\frac{d_{(k)}}{\sum_{~(i,j)\in
R_{(k)}}\exp (\eta _{ij})},
\label{eq:5}   (\#eq:5)$$
are solutions of the estimating equations, $\partial h/\partial \lambda
_{0k}=0$, for $k=1,\ldots ,l$. Here, $d_{(k)}$ is the number of events
at $y_{(k)}$ and
$$R_{(k)}=R(y_{(k)})=\{(i,j):y_{ij}\geq y_{(k)}\}$$
is the risk set at $y_{(k)}$. @R:Therneau+Grambsch:2000 and
@R:Ripatti+Palmgren:2000 proposed an h-likelihood (3), while using the
partial likelihood [@R:Breslow:1974] for $\ell _{0}$. They call it the
penalized partial likelihood (PPL) $h_{p}$, defined by
$$\begin{split}
h_{p}(\beta ,v,\alpha )=&\sum_{ij}\delta _{ij}\eta _{ij}-\\
& \sum_{k}d_{(k)}\log
\biggl \{\sum_{~ij\in R_{(k)}~}\exp (\eta _{ij})\biggl \}+\ell _{1}.
\end{split}$$
Furthermore, @R:Ha+Lee+Song:2001 and @R:Ha+Noh+Lee:2010 have shown that
$h^{\ast }$ is proportional to the PPL $h_{p}$ because
$$\begin{aligned}
h^{\ast } &= \sum_{k}d_{(k)}\log \widehat{\lambda }_{0k}+\sum_{ij}\delta
_{ij}\eta _{ij}-\sum_{k}d_{(k)}~+~\ell _{1} \\
&= h_{p}+\sum_{k}d_{(k)}\{\log d_{(k)}-1\},
\end{aligned}$$
where $\sum_{k}d_{(k)}\{\log d_{(k)}-1\}$ is a constant that does not
depend upon unknown parameters. Notice here that PPL $h_{p}$ does not
depend on nuisance parameters $\lambda _{0}$. Thus, Lee and Nelder's
[-@R:Lee+Nelder:1996; -@R:Lee+Nelder:2001] h-likelihood procedure for
HGLMs can be directly used to fit frailty models based on $h_{p}$
[@R:Ha+Noh+Lee:2010].

## Review of estimation procedures

@R:Lee+Nelder:1996 [@R:Lee+Nelder:2001] have proposed the use of the
Laplace approximation based on the h-likelihood when the marginal
likelihood, $m=\log
\{\int \exp (h)dv\}$, is hard to obtain. To reduce the bias in small
cluster sizes higher-order approximations for the mean ($\beta$) and the
frailty variance ($\alpha$) have been developed. The lower-order
approximation is computationally efficient, but could have large biases
when cluster sizes are small
[@R:Ha+Lee:2003; @R:Ha+Lee:2005; @R:Ha+Noh+Lee:2010].

The h-likelihood procedures use the Breslow method for handling tied
event times, while the PPL procedures allow the Efron method. For
estimating $\beta$, the h-likelihood methods allow the Laplace
approximation $p_{v}(h_{p})$ to a marginal partial likelihood
$m_{p}=\log \{\int \exp
(h_{p})dv\}$, but the PPL procedures do not. For estimating $\alpha$,
the PPL methods use adjusted profile h-likelihoods $p_{v}(h_{p})$ and
$p_{\beta
,v}(h_{p}$) which give maximum partial likelihood (MPL) and restricted
maximum partial likelihood (REMPL) estimators, respectively. In
contrast, the h-likelihood method uses the restricted partial likelihood
(based upon the first-order Laplace approximation $p_{\beta ,v}(h_{p})$
or the second-order Laplace approximation $s_{\beta ,v}(h_{p})$) for
REMPL estimators. Here $p_{v}(h_{p})$ and $p_{\beta ,v}(h_{p})$ are
defined as follows:
$$p_{v}(h_{p})=[h_{p}-\frac{1}{2}\log \det \{D(h_{p},v)/(2\pi )\}]|_{v=\hat{v},}$$
where $D(h_{p},v)=-\partial ^{2}h_{p}/\partial v^{2}$ and $\hat{v}$
solves $\partial h_{p}/\partial v=0$, which is the first-order Laplace
approximation of $m_{p}$, and
$$p_{\beta ,v}(h_{p})=\left.\left[h_{p}-\frac{1}{2}\log \det \left\{
\frac{D(h_{p},(\beta ,v))}{2\pi}
\right\}\right]\right|_{\beta =\hat{\beta},v=\hat{v},}$$
where $D(h_{p},(\beta ,v))=-\partial ^{2}h_{p}/\partial (\beta ,v)^{2}$
and $(\hat{\beta},\hat{v})$ solves
$\partial h_{p}/\partial (\beta ,v)=0$, which becomes the
@R:Cox+Reid:1987 adjusted profile marginal likelihood, eliminating fixed
effects $\beta$ by conditioning their asymptotic sufficient statistics
$\hat{\beta},$ in addition to eliminating random effects $v$ by the
first-order Laplace approximation
[@R:Ha+Lee:2003; @R:Lee+Nelder+Pawitan:2006]. The corresponding
second-order approximation is
$$s_{\beta ,v}(h_{p})=p_{\beta ,v}(h_{p})-\{F(h_{p})/24\},$$
with
$$\begin{gathered}
\textstyle
F(h_{p})=\left.\mathrm{tr}\left[-\left\{3\frac{\partial ^{4}h_{p}}{\partial
v^{4}}+
5\frac{\partial ^{3}h_{p}}{\partial v^{3}}D(h_{p},v)^{-1} 
\frac{\partial^{3}h_{p}}{\partial v^{3}}\right\}
%% Braces must match on each line of multline:
\right.\right. %fake closure
\\             %split
\left.\left.   %fake open on next line
\times D(h_{p},v)^{-2}\right]\right|_{v=\widehat{v}.}
\end{gathered}$$
To reduce the computational burden @R:Ha+Noh+Lee:2010 used $F(h)$
instead of $F(h_{p})$.

  : Table 1: Estimation criteria for h-likelihood (HL(`mord`, `dord`)),
  PPL (`coxph()`, `coxme()`) and marginal likelihood ( `phmm()`) for
  lognormal (LN) and gamma frailty models (FM)

Table 1 shows historical developments of estimating criteria for frailty
models. The `frailtyHL()` function provides estimators based on the
h-likelihood. As the orders in `mord` and `dord` increase, the bias of
estimator is reduced, but the calculation becomes computationally
intensive due to the extra terms. We recommend the use of HL(1,1) for
the lognormal frailty and of HL(1,2) for the gamma frailty. However,
HL(0,1) for the lognormal frailty and HL(0,2) for the gamma frailty
often perform well if $\alpha$ is not large. Note that the variance
matrices of $\hat{\tau}=(\hat{\beta},\hat{v})$ and $\hat{\alpha}$ are
directly obtained from the Hessian matrices, $\{-\partial
^{2}h_{p}/\partial \tau ^{2}\}^{-1}$ and $\{-\partial ^{2}p_{\beta
,v}(h_{p})/\partial \alpha ^{2}\}^{-1}$, respectively; the *frailtyHL*
package provides the standard errors (SEs) of $\hat{\alpha}$ as well as
$\hat{\beta}$. For the use of standard errors of $\hat{v}-v$, see
@R:Lee+Ha:2010, @R:Lee+Jang+Lee:2011 and @R:Ha+Sylvester+Legrand:2011.

Based on the PPL methods, the `coxph()` and `coxme()` functions,
respectively, implement REMPL and MPL estimators for $\alpha$ in the
lognormal frailty model, and the `coxph()` function the maximum
likelihood (ML) estimators, maximizing the marginal likelihood $m$, for
$\alpha$ in the gamma frailty model. For comparison, we present the
Breslow and Efron methods for handling ties in survival times in the
`coxph()` and `coxme()` functions; @R:Therneau:2010 recommended the
Efron method. For the lognormal frailty the ML estimator maximizing $m$
is available via the `phmm()` function, but care must be taken to ensure
that the MCEM algorithm has converged [@R:Donohue+Xu:2012]. However, the
ML estimator can be biased when the number of nuisance parameters
increases with the sample size [@R:Ha+Noh+Lee:2010].

Furthermore, for the lognormal frailty the `coxph()` function uses the
existing codes in linear mixed models so that it misses the
$\partial \hat{v}
/\partial \alpha$ term in solving the score equation $\partial p_{\beta
,v}(h_{p})/\partial \alpha =0$; this can lead to an underestimation of
the parameters, especially when the number of subjects $q$ is large or
censoring is high [@R:Lee+Nelder+Pawitan:2006; @R:Ha+Noh+Lee:2010]. To
overcome this problem, in gamma frailty models @R:Therneau+Grambsch:2000
develop the code for the ML estimator for $\alpha$.

## Fitting algorithm

Suppose that HL(0,1) is used. The fitting algorithm is as follows:

Step 1:

:   Take $(0,0,0.1)$ as initial estimates of components of $%
    (\beta ,v,\alpha )$.

Step 2:

:   Given $\hat{\alpha}$, new estimates $(\hat{\beta},\hat{v})$ are
    obtained by solving the joint estimating equations $\partial
    h_{p}/\partial (\beta,v)= \{\partial h/\partial (\beta,v)\}|_{\lambda_0=\hat
    \lambda_0}=0$; then, given $(\hat{\beta},\hat{v})$, new estimates
    $\hat{%
    \alpha}$ are obtained by solving
    $\partial p_{\beta ,v}(h_{p})/\partial
    \alpha =0$.

Step 3:

:   Repeat Step 2 until the maximum absolute difference between the
    previous and current estimates for $(\beta, v)$ and $\alpha$ is less
    than $10^{-6}$.

After convergence, we compute the estimates of the standard errors of
$\hat
\beta$ and $\hat \alpha$.

## Illustration: kidney infection data

To demonstrate differences of various estimation methods in small
cluster size $n_{i}\equiv 2$, we use the kidney infection data
[@R:McGilchrist+Aisbett:1991]. The data consist of times until the first
and second recurrences ($n_{i}\equiv 2$ ) of kidney infection in 38
($q=38$) patients using a portable dialysis machine. Each survival time
(`time`) is the time until infection since the insertion of the
catheter. The survival times for the same patient are likely to be
related because of a shared frailty describing the common patient's
effect. The catheter is later removed if infection occurs and can be
removed for other reasons, which we regard as censoring; about 24% of
the data were censored.

We fit frailty models with two covariates, the sex (1 = male; 2 =
female) and age of each patient, using the functions (`frailtyHL()`,
`coxph()` , `coxme()` and `phmm()`) in the four packages. The results
are summarized in Table 2.

  : Table 2: Comparison of different estimation methods for the kidney
  infection data

In PPL procedures (`coxph()` and `coxme()`), the Breslow method provides
slightly smaller estimate for $\alpha$ than the Efron method. In the
lognormal frailty, REMPL procedures (`fraityHL()` and `coxph()`) give
larger estimates for $\alpha$ than ML (`phmm()`) and MPL (`coxme()`)
procedures. However, both ML and MPL estimates from `phmm()` and
`coxme()` are somewhat different when cluster size is small,
$n_{i}\equiv 2$ for all $i$. For the gamma frailty, `coxph()` uses the
ML procedure, but it still gives smaller estimate for $\alpha$ than the
REMPL (h-likelihood) procedures. Compared with the h-likelihood methods,
PPL methods are computationally more efficient, but could have larger
biases [@R:Ha+Noh+Lee:2010].

## Potential future developments

The current version of the *frailtyHL* package allows multi-component
(multilevel) frailties. Allowance for correlation
[@R:Ha+Sylvester+Legrand:2011] between random effects, for example
correlations between random center effect and random treatment effect,
is currently in progress. Other developments include dispersion frailty
models based on double HGLMs [@R:Lee+Nelder:2006], which allow fixed and
random effects in dispersion parts (i.e.Â variance of random effects) of
the model as well as the hazard functions, and joint modelling
[@R:Ha+Park+Lee:2003] of HGLMs and frailty models.

# Examples

## Example 1: Lognormal and gamma frailty models on rat data

The data set presented by @R:Mantel+Bohidar+Ciminera:1977 is based on a
tumorigenesis study of 50 ($q=50$) litters of female rats. For each
litter, one rat was selected to receive the drug and the other two rats
were placebo-treated controls ($n_{i}\equiv 3$). Here each litter is
treated as a cluster. The survival time (`time`) is the time to
development of tumor, measured in weeks. Death before occurrence of
tumor yields a right-censored observation; forty rats developed a tumor,
leading to censoring of about 73%. The survival times for rats in a
given litter may be correlated due to a random effect representing
shared genetic or environmental effects.

We fit frailty models with one covariate, rx (1 = drug; 0 = placebo),
using `frailtyHL()`. Below, we present the code and results for the
lognormal frailty model with HL(1,1). The output from the R code shows
that the effect of rx is significant (t-value = 2.823 with p-value =
0.005). That is, the rx group has a significantly higher risk than in
control group. Here, the variance estimate of the frailty is
$\hat{\alpha}=0.427$ (with SE = 0.423).

Note that although we report the SE of $\alpha$, one should not use it
for testing the absence of frailty $\alpha =0$ [@R:Vaida+Xu:2000]. Such
a null hypothesis is on the boundary of the parameter space, so that the
critical value of an asymptotic $(\chi _{0}^{2}+\chi _{1}^{2})/2$
distribution is 2.71 at 5% significant level
[@R:Lee+Nelder+Pawitan:2006; @R:Ha+Sylvester+Legrand:2011]. The
difference in deviance (based on REMPL) $-2p_{\beta ,v}(h_{p})$ between
the Cox model without frailty and the lognormal frailty model is
$364.15-362.56=1.59(<2.71)$, indicating that the frailty effect is
non-significant, i.e.Â $\alpha =0$. Here, the results from fitting the
Cox model without frailty are available by adding the two arguments
`varfixed = TRUE` and `varinit = 0` in the `frailtyHL()`: see below.

The code and results for the gamma frailty model with HL(1,2) are
presented below. The output shows that these results are similar to
those of the lognormal frailty, particularly for estimation of $\beta$.
The deviance difference (based on REMPL) between the Cox model and gamma
frailty model using the second-order approximation
$-2s_{\beta ,v}(h_{p})$ is $364.15-362.12=2.03(<2.71)$, again indicating

lognormal frailty model.

For the selection of a model among nested or non-nested models such as
lognormal and gamma frailty models, we may use three Akaike information
criteria (AIC)
[@R:Lee+Nelder+Pawitan:2006; @R:Donohue+Overholser:2011; @R:Ha+Lee+MacKenzie:2007]
based on conditional likelihood, marginal likelihood and restricted
likelihood, respectively, defined by
$$\begin{aligned}
\mathrm{cAIC} &= -2h_{0}+2\mathrm{df_{c}}, \\
\mathrm{mAIC} &= -2p_{v}(h_{p})+2\mathrm{df_{m}}, \\
\mathrm{rAIC} &= -2p_{\beta ,v}(h_{p})+2\mathrm{df_{r}},
\end{aligned}$$
where $h_{0}=\ell _{0}^{\ast }$ in (4), and
$$\mathrm{df_{c}} = \mathrm{trace}\left\{ D^{-1}(h_{p},(\beta ,v))
                  D(h_{0},(\beta,v))\right\}$$
is an 'effective degrees of freedom adjustment' for estimating the fixed
and random effects, computed using the Hessian matrices
$D(h_{p},(\beta ,v))=-\partial ^{2}h_{p}/\partial (\beta ,v)^{2}$ and
$D(h_{0},(\beta ,v))=-\partial ^{2}h_{0}/\partial (\beta ,v)^{2}$. Note
here that $\mathrm{df_{m}}$ is the number of fixed parameters and
$\mathrm{df_{r}}$ is the number of dispersion parameters
[@R:Ha+Lee+MacKenzie:2007]. For calculation of the mAIC and rAIC of
gamma frailty model using HL(0,2) or HL(1,2), we use the corresponding
second-order approximations, defined by $\mathrm{mAIC}
=-2s_{v}(h_{p})+2\mathrm{df_{m}}$ and
$\mathrm{rAIC} =-2s_{\beta ,v}(h_{p})+2
\mathrm{df_{r}}$. We select a model to minimize the AIC values among
models. If the AIC difference is larger than 1 the choice can be made
[@R:Sakamoto+Ishiguro+Kitagawa:1986]. However, if the difference is less
than 1 a simpler model can be selected by a parsimony principle
[@R:Donohue+Overholser:2011].

In the data set, in the Cox model cAIC=365.69, mAIC=365.69 and
rAIC=364.15, and in the lognormal frailty model cAIC=362.22, mAIC=366.14
and rAIC=364.56, and in the gamma frailty model cAIC=365.30, mAIC=365.71
and rAIC=364.12. The likelihood tests based upon the REMPL showed the
absence of frailty effect ($\alpha =0$), so that mAIC and rAIC of all
the three models are similar. Thus, we may choose the parsimonious Cox
model. However, the cAIC selects the lognormal model, indicating that
this model could give better prediction.

## Example 2: Multilevel frailty models on CGD infection data

The CGD data set presented by @R:Fleming+Harrington:1991 consists of a
placebo-controlled randomized trial of gamma interferon (rIFN-g) in the
treatment of chronic granulomatous disease (CGD). 128 patients (`id`)
from 13 centers ($q_1=13, q_2=128$) were tracked for around 1 year. The
number (i.e.Â cluster size) of patients per center ranged from 4 to 26.
The survival times (`tstop`-`tstart`) are the recurrent infection times
of each patient from the different centers. Censoring occurred at the
last observation for all patients, except one, who experienced a serious
infection on the day he left the study; in the CGD study about 63% of
the data were censored. The recurrent infection times for a given
patient are likely to be correlated. However, each patient belongs to
one of the 13 centers; hence, the correlation may also be attributed to
a center effect.

Ignoring important random components may render invalid many of the
traditional statistical analysis techniques. We fit a multilevel
lognormal frailty model with two frailties and a single covariate, treat
(rIFN-g, placebo), using `frailtyHL()`. Here, the two frailties are
random center and patient effects. The code and results using HL(1,1)
are provided below. The output shows that the effect of treatment is
significant (t-value = -3.476 with p-value \< 0.001), indicating that
rIFN-g significantly reduces the rate of serious infection in CGD
patients. The estimate of variance of patient frailty
($\hat{\alpha}_{2}=1.002$) is considerably larger than variance of
center frailty ($\hat{\alpha}_{1}=0.030$), indicating that the
random-patient effect is more heterogeneous.

``` r
> library(survival)
> data(cgd)
> frailtyHL(Surv(tstop-tstart,status) ~ treat + 
+             (1|center) + (1|id),

+           RandDist = "Normal", mord = 1, dord = 1)

For testing the absence of a random component ($\alpha _{1}=0$ or
$\alpha
_{2}=0$), we use the deviance based on REMPL, $-2p_{\beta ,v}(h_{p})$,
and fit the following four models including the Cox model and three
lognormal frailty models using HL(1,1) method,

M1:

:   Cox model without frailty $(\alpha _{1}=0,\alpha _{2}=0)$ has
    $-2p_{\beta ,v}(h_{p})=707.48$,

M2:

:   model without patient effect $(\alpha_{1} >0, \alpha _{2}=0)$ has
    $-2p_{\beta,v}(h_p)=703.66$,

M3:

:   model without center effect $(\alpha_{1}=0,\alpha_{2} >0)$ has
    $-2p_{\beta,v}(h_p)=692.99$, and

M4:

:   multilevel model above requiring both patient and center effects
    $(\alpha_{1}>0,\alpha_{2}>0)$ has $-2p_{\beta,v}(h_p)=692.95$.

The deviance difference between M3 and M4 is $692.99-692.95=0.04$ ,
which is not significant at a 5% level ($\chi _{1,0.10}^{2}=2.71$),
indicating the absence of the random-center effects,
i.e.Â $\alpha _{1}=0$. The deviance difference between M2 and M4 is
703.66-692.95=10.71, indicating that the random-patient effects are
necessary, i.e.Â $\alpha _{2}>0$. In addition, the deviance difference
between M1 and M3 is 707.48-692.99=14.49, indicating that the
random-patient effects are indeed necessary with or without
random-center effects.

Let us choose a final model using information criteria. For M1 we have
cAIC=708.68, mAIC=708.68 and rAIC=707.48; for M2 cAIC=702.96,
mAIC=706.88 and rAIC=705.66; for M3 cAIC=684.84, mAIC=696.68 and
rAIC=694.99; for M4 cAIC=684.92, mAIC=698.63 and rAIC=696.95. All of the
three criteria choose M3 in the CGD data set.

## Comparison of results with alternative procedures

Using the examples in the previous section, we compare the outcomes from
*frailtyHL* and other packages. We consider the three functions (
`coxph()`, `coxme()` and `phmm()`) for the lognormal frailty model and
the `coxph()` function for the gamma frailty model.

**Example 1: Rat data** The codes of `coxph()`, `coxme()` and `phmm()`
for fitting lognormal frailty model are, respectively, as follows:

``` r
>coxph(Surv(time, status) ~ rx + 
+         frailty(litter, dist = "gauss"),
+      method = "breslow", rats)

> coxme(Surv(time, status) ~ rx + (1|litter),
+       ties = "breslow", rats)

> phmm(Surv(time, status) ~ rx + (1|litter),
+      data = rats, Gbs = 2000, Gbsvar = 3000, 
+      VARSTART = 1, NINIT = 10, 
+      MAXSTEP = 200, CONVERG=90)
```

Table 3 summarizes the estimation results. Even though cluster size
$n_{i}\equiv 3$ is not large, the results are similar. For example, MPL
and ML estimates for $\alpha$ from `coxme()` and `phmm()` are somewhat
different in Table 2 when $n_{i}\equiv 2$, while they become similar in
Table 3.

Next, the code of `coxph()` for fitting the gamma frailty model is
below:

``` r
> coxph(Surv(time, status) ~ rx + 
+           frailty(litter, dist = "gamma"),
+       method = "breslow", rats)
```

The results of `frailtyHL()` (HL(0,2), HL(1,2)) and `coxph()` for gamma
frailty are also presented in Table 3. For the estimation of $\beta$
both results from `frailtyHL()`Â and `coxph()`Â are similar, but for
$\alpha$ they are somewhat different. That is, our REMPL estimates from
`frailtyHL()` ($\hat{\alpha}=0.575$ with HL(0,2) and $\hat{\alpha}
=0.576$ with HL(1,2)) are somewhat larger than the ML estimates from
`coxph()` ($\hat{\alpha}=0.474$ with Breslow method and $\hat{\alpha}
=0.499$ with Efron method).

**Example 2: CGD data** The code of the `coxme()` function for fitting
multilevel lognormal frailty model is as follows:

``` r
> coxme(Surv(tstop - tstart,status) ~
+       treat + (1|center) + (1|id), 
+       ties = "breslow", cgd)
```

The results of `frailtyHL()`(HL(0,1), HL(1,1)) and `coxme()` are
summarized in Table 4. The results from HL and PPL methods for frailty
parameters become more similar because the cluster sizes (the number of
patients from different centers) are somewhat large, ranging from 4 to
26.

# Summary

The h-likelihood method offers novel possibilities to fit various models
with random effects. The *frailtyHL* package for frailty models
eliminates the nuisance parameters $\lambda_{0}$ in the h-likelihood (3)
by profiling. Such models have important applications in multi-center
clinical study [@R:Vaida+Xu:2000], meta analysis
[@R:Rondeau+Michiels+Liquet+Pignon:2008], and genetic analysis
[@R:Lee+Nelder+Pawitan:2006]. Therefore, this package can be potentially
adopted by statisticians in several different fields.
