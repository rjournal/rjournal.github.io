title: 'FarmTest: An R Package for Factor-Adjusted Robust Multiple Testing'
abstract: ' We provide a publicly available library [FarmTest](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=FarmTest)
  in the R programming system. This library implements a factor-adjusted robust multiple
  testing principle proposed by [@FKSZ2017] for large-scale simultaneous inference
  on mean effects. We use a multi-factor model to explicitly capture the dependence
  among a large pool of variables. Three types of factors are considered: observable,
  latent, and a mixture of observable and latent factors. The non-factor case, which
  corresponds to standard multiple mean testing under weak dependence, is also included.
  The library implements a series of adaptive Huber methods integrated with fast data-driven
  tuning schemes to estimate model parameters and to construct test statistics that
  are robust against heavy-tailed and asymmetric error distributions. Extensions to
  two-sample multiple mean testing problems are also discussed. The results of some
  simulation experiments and a real data analysis are reported. '
