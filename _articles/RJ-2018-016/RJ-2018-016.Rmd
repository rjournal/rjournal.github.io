title: 'ArCo: An R package to Estimate Artificial Counterfactuals'
abstract: In this paper we introduce the ArCo package for R which consists of a set
  of functions to implement the the Artificial Counterfactual (ArCo) methodology to
  estimate causal effects of an intervention (treatment) on aggregated data and when
  a control group is not necessarily available. The ArCo method is a two-step procedure,
  where in the first stage a counterfactual is estimated from a large panel of time
  series from a pool of untreated peers. In the second-stage, the average treatment
  effect over the post-intervention sample is computed. Standard inferential procedures
  are available. The package is illustrated with both simulated and real datasets.
