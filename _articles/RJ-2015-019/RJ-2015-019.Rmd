title: 'zoib: An R Package for Bayesian Inference for Beta Regression and Zero/One
  Inflated Beta Regression'
abstract: The beta distribution is a versatile function that accommodates a broad
  range of probability distribution shapes. Beta regression based on the beta distribution
  can be used to model a response variable y that takes values in open unit interval
  (0, 1). Zero/one inflated beta (ZOIB) regression models can be applied when y takes
  values from closed unit interval [0, 1]. The ZOIB model is based a piecewise distribution
  that accounts for the probability mass at 0 and 1, in addition to the probability
  density within (0, 1). This paper introduces an R package â€“ zoib that provides Bayesian
  inferences for a class of ZOIB models. The statistical methodology underlying the
  zoib package is discussed, the functions covered by the package are outlined, and
  the usage of the package is illustrated with three examples of different data and
  model types. The package is comprehensive and versatile in that it can model data
  with or without inflation at 0 or 1, accommodate clustered and correlated data via
  latent variables, perform penalized regression as needed, and allow for model comparison
  via the computation of the DIC criterion.
