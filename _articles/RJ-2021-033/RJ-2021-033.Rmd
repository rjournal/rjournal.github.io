title: Benchmarking R packages for Calculation of Persistent Homology
abstract: Several persistent homology software libraries have been implemented in
  R. Specifically, the Dionysus, GUDHI, and Ripser libraries have been wrapped by
  the **TDA** and **TDAstats** CRAN packages. These software represent powerful analysis
  tools that are computationally expensive and, to our knowledge, have not been formally
  benchmarked. Here, we analyze runtime and memory growth for the 2 R packages and
  the 3 underlying libraries. We find that datasets with less than 3 dimensions can
  be evaluated with persistent homology fastest by the GUDHI library in the **TDA**
  package. For higher-dimensional datasets, the Ripser library in the TDAstats package
  is the fastest. Ripser and **TDAstats** are also the most memory-efficient tools
  to calculate persistent homology.

# Introduction

Topological data analysis (TDA) is a broad set of methodologies that
characterizes structural features of datasets inspired by topological
principles. It has a broad range of usage, from viral evolution to
physical chemistry [@TDA-Viral; @TDA-PChem]. Within the umbrella of TDA,
persistent homology represents an algebraic approach to understanding
the number, characteristics, and persistence of structural features in
an $n$-dimensional point cloud. In the basic workflow of persistent
homology, a series of simplicial complexes are generated on point clouds
to characterize topological features. There are several methods to
generate these complexes on point clouds. In this paper, we focus on
persistent homology of the Vietoris-Rips and alpha complexes, which use
simplicial complexes to approximate topologic relationships in point
clouds. The exact method of constructing these complexes is described in
the Mathematics section. Essentially, we measure features that are
discovered by the algorithm at a particular stage and disappear at a
later stage. The difference between these stages is persistence.
Features with larger persistence more likely represent real geometric
patterns rather than noise.

There are several C++ libraries available to researchers that calculate
alpha and Vietoris-Rips complexes, such as Dionysus, GUDHI, and Ripser
[@Dionysus; @gudhi; @Ripser]. These libraries have been wrapped in R by
the [TDA](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=TDA) and
[TDAstats](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=TDAstats) packages
[@TDA; @TDAstats]. Although useful, calculating persistent homology for
large datasets is often limited due to computational complexity
[@roadmap]. As a result, researchers often limit persistent homology
analysis to lower dimensions. However, ignoring features in higher
dimensions may cause significant information loss, underutilizing
persistent homology's capabilities. Here, we aim to benchmark two R
packages - [TDA](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=TDA) and
[TDAstats](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=TDAstats) - and enable
researchers to most efficiently calculate persistent homology in R.

# Mathematics of Persistent Homology

An $n$-dimensional simplex is the convex hull of $n+1$ points in a
Euclidean space. More intuitively, an $n$-dimensional simplex is the
simplest $n$-dimensional object (e.g., a 0-simplex is a point, a
1-simplex is a line, a 2-simplex is a triangle, 3-simplex is a
tetrahedron). These simplices can be glued together on common
sub-simplices to form a simplicial complex (e.g., two triangles sharing
a common side). In a simplicial complex, topological features will arise
that can be characterized by Betti numbers. Each Betti number, denoted
by $B_k$, $k$ counts the number of features in dimension $k$. $B_0$
counts the number of connected components, $B_1$ counts refer to loops,
$B_2$ counts the number of voids, and so on [@phom-survey].

There are several different methods to construct a simplicial complex on
a given point cloud $S$, but this paper focuses on the Vietoris-Rips and
alpha complexes. The Vietoris-Rips complex is perhaps the most common
method for constructing a simplicial complex to calculate persistent
homology [@Rips-Complex]. In a point cloud of $k$ points in 2
dimensions, a distance parameter, $\delta > 0$, can be used to draw a
circle of diameter $\delta$ around every point in $S$. For point clouds
in 3 dimensions, spheres of diameter $\delta$ are drawn around each
point. For dimensions $k$ greater than 3, a $k$-dimensional hypersphere
is drawn around each point. The remainder of this explanation will focus
on the 2-dimensional case. If $\delta$ is sufficiently large, then some
of the resulting circles may intersect. In this case, a line is drawn to
connect the points at the center of the intersecting circles. When a
triple of points is connected, we add a triangle (2-simplex). When a
quadruple of points are connected, we add a tetrahedron (3-simplex) and
so forth. However, we only add simplices at most of the dimension of the
space of the point clouds (e.g., only up to 3-simplices are added in a
3-dimensional point cloud). This group of points and lines form the
skeleton of a simplicial complex. For each distance parameter, $\delta$,
there will be a single simplicial complex associated with it. As
$\delta$ increases, different topological features may appear, persist,
and eventually disappear.

Once $\delta$ reaches the maximum Euclidean distance between any pair of
points in the point cloud, a convex hull will form around all $k$ points
creating a $(k-1)$-dimensional simplex. A 3-column matrix can be created
recording the dimension of each feature, the $\delta$ at which that
feature appeared, and the $\delta$ at which it disappeared. This matrix
characterizes the persistent homology of that point cloud.

![**Basic Visualization of the Vietoris-Rips Complex.** For a given
parameter, $\delta$, $\delta$-diameter circles are drawn around each
point. If two circles intersect, a point is drawn between their centers.
As $\delta$ continues to grow, more circles intersect, filling out the
simplicial complex. Features on the simplicial complex appear and die as
$\delta$ increases. These features' dimensions, birth, and death are
recorded in an $n$x3 matrix. Eventually, the full convex hull is drawn,
ending the \"filtration\" process.](fig1.png){height="2.5in"}

Alpha complexes provide another method to generate simplicial complexes
on the point cloud $S$. For alpha complexes, we partition the whole
space in which the data resides into cells such that each cell contains
exactly one data point $x$, and the cell of that data point is the set
of all points closer to $x$ than any other data points. Such a partition
is also known as a Voronoi diagram. The nerve of a Voronoi diagram is
equivalent to the Delaunay Triangulation [@alpha-complex]. Alpha
complexes are simplicial complexes that are subsets of the Delaunay
Triangulation. The parameter, $\alpha$, can describe the radius of a
ball (dimension matches dimension of the space) of each point in the
point cloud $S$ much, like $\delta$ describes the diameter of a circle
in the Vietoris-Rips complex. We first intersect the $\alpha$ radius
balls with their own Voronoi cell and then search for intersections of
these subsetted balls to form simplices. Once $\alpha$ is large enough,
the full Delaunay Triangulation is formed. In between these stages, the
birth and death of features at certain values of $\alpha$ can be
captured in a 3-column persistent homology matrix much like the
Vietoris-Rips complex. One key difference from the Vietoris-Rips complex
is that edges can only form between neighboring points in the alpha
complex.

![**Basic visualization of the Alpha complex.** For a given $\alpha$,
$\alpha$-radius balls are drawn around each point, and the union of the
balls is taken. Then, an intersection between this union of
$\alpha$-balls and the Vornoi diagram is taken. A connecting segment is
drawn between points in adjacent Voronoi cells once the $\alpha$-ball
fills out the Voronoi diagram. As $\alpha$ grows, more circles fill out
the Voronoi cells. Once $\alpha$ is large enough, the Delaunay
Triangulation is formed.](fig2.png){width="4in"}

In both methods, the boundary matrix records all simplicial complexes
for each parameter value ($\delta$ for Vietoris-Rips complexes and
$\alpha$ for alpha complexes). Calculating persistent homology is
divided into two steps: (1) forming the boundary matrix and (2) reducing
the boundary matrix to be able to read off the topological features of
each dimension and their birth/death values of the parameter. The second
step can be computed in at most O(k\^3) steps, where k is the number of
rows (and columns) of the boundary matrix. The size of the boundary
matrix can describe the memory complexity on the random access memory
(RAM) for persistent homology calculations. We compare memory complexity
between alpha and Vietoris-Rips complexes in this paper.

Alpha complex calculations have a run time complexity of $O(n^{d/2})$,
and Vietoris-Rips complex calculations have a run time complexity of
$O(2^n)$, where $n$ is the number of points and $d$ is the point cloud
dimension [@roadmap]. Vietoris-Rips's run time and memory are
exponential with regards to point number (but constant with data
dimension) in contrast to alpha complexes where run time and memory are
polynomial with point number (but exponential with data dimension).
Therefore, we can predict that low dimensional point clouds favor alpha
complexes, but fewer points in higher dimension favor Vietoris-Rips
complexes.

![ **Calculating persistent homology of a torus with three TDA
libraries.** Median runtime (min to max, $n=10$ iterations per data
point) for each TDA library (denoted by color) is plotted against point
cloud size. Homological features of up to 2 dimensions were calculated.
Time complexity follows a power law for all three libraries (see GitHub
repo for regression details). Although the libraries have similar
runtimes for smaller point clouds, Dionysus has a clear disadvantage
when the number of points exceeds 100. When the number of points exceeds
200, Ripser has a clear advantage over GUDHI, which maintains its
advantage over Dionysus. ](fig3.png){#fig:tor height="2.5in"}

# Methods

We use [readr](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=readr) v1.3.1 to read
rectangular data [@readr],

[@deldir], ggtda v0.1 [@ggtda], and
[magick](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=magick) v2.2 [@magick] to
visualize data, [bench](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=bench) v1.0.4
to collect benchmark data [@bench],
[TDA](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=TDA) v1.6.9 [@TDA] and
[TDAstats](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=TDAstats) v0.4.1
[@TDAstats] to calculate persistent homology of Vietoris-Rips and alpha
simplicial complices, and
[pryr](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=pryr) v0.1.4 for calculations
involving R objects [@pryr]. Median runtime calculations are shown along
with the minimum and maximum of 10 iterations per benchmark. Datasets
were generated by sampling functions in base R to generate points
uniformly distributed over circles (dimension = 2), spheres (dimension =
3), filled squares (dimension = 2), filled cubes (dimension = 3, 4), and
tori (dimension = 3). The number of points per point cloud varied from
25 to 500 along with intervals of 25 points, which were empirical limits
chosen after considering available computational resources. For
consistency between software libraries, the minimum and maximum
simplicial complex radii were predetermined for each point cloud and
provided as parameters to the
[TDA](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=TDA) and
[TDAstats](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=TDAstats) R packages.
Within the [TDA](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=TDA) package,
benchmark data was collected for the GUDHI [@gudhi] and Dionysus
[@Dionysus] libraries; within the
[TDAstats](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=TDAstats) package,
benchmark data was collected for the Ripser [@Ripser] library. As alpha
complex calculation was only implemented in GUDHI, alpha complex
benchmark data was naturally only collected for the single library.
Measuring memory usage proved challenging since all the libraries
calculating persistent homology were implemented in either C++ or Java
and then wrapped in R as part of a CRAN package. Thus, memory burden was
indirectly measured by using boundary matrix size as a proxy. Given that
Ripser optimizes computation of persistent homology by avoiding
calculation of a boundary matrix, memory use benchmarks are not provided
for Ripser and, consequently,
[TDAstats](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=TDAstats).

Benchmark data were collected twice - once on a local machine and once
on a remote computing node, each of which featured 16 GB RAM. Both
datasets were compared for consistency and are publicly available at the
repository linked below. Data from the remote computing node is
visualized in this report. The larger point clouds required more than 16
GB of RAM to calculate persistent homology using a subset of the
libraries; attempts to compute results resulted in runtime errors, and
the corresponding output is missing from the corresponding figures and
tables. Fully reproducible code for all numerical results and figures
can be found at <https://github.com/eashwarsoma/TDA-benchmark>. This
GitHub repository also contains instructions for generating the

# Results

Computing persistent homology of a canonical torus grants quick insight
into efficiency of each library (Figure
[1](#fig:tor){reference-type="ref" reference="fig:tor"}). Dionysus
exhibits the longest median runtime, and, although Ripser and GUDHI have
similar runtimes for smaller point clouds, as the number of points
increases Ripser eventually has a significant lead. Next, we compare
library performance with multiple canonical datasets to ensure that the
noted pattern generalizes.

Tori do not trivially generalize to other dimensions, but circles do.
Benchmarking on a circular point cloud permits confirmation of the
pattern in Figure [1](#fig:tor){reference-type="ref"
reference="fig:tor"} while also revealing how the libraries compare as
the dataset dimension increases. Figure
[\[fig:cir\]](#fig:cir){reference-type="ref" reference="fig:cir"}
exhibits the resulting data for a 2-dimensional circle (left panel),
3-dimensional sphere (center panel), and 4-dimensional hypersphere
(right panel). When the dataset dimension equals 2, GUDHI practically
matches Ripser's performance in outpacing Dionysus. However, in the case
of the 3-dimensional sphere, the pattern visualized in Figure
[1](#fig:tor){reference-type="ref" reference="fig:tor"} for the
3-dimensional torus is again present. By the 4th dimension, the gap
between Ripser and GUDHI widens. Of note, missing points for larger
datasets in Figure [\[fig:cir\]](#fig:cir){reference-type="ref"
reference="fig:cir"} are not plotted if and only if calculating
persistent homology caused an error due to insufficient RAM. Thus, for
the hypersphere, Ripser was able to calculate persistent homology for a
dataset with approximately 3 times as many points as Dionysus and over 2
times as many as GUDHI. Interestingly, all curves plotted in Figure
[\[fig:cir\]](#fig:cir){reference-type="ref" reference="fig:cir"} grow
polynomially with respect to the number of points (see Supplement for
regression details).

Large data and feature dimensionality often restrict persistent homology
calculations to small point clouds due to computational limits. When
calculating persistent homology on a high-dimensional point cloud, as
Vietoris-Rips feature dimension increases, there is a corresponding
increase in runtime (Figure [\[fig:box\]](#fig:box){reference-type="ref"
reference="fig:box"}). Dionysus is clearly outmatched by GUDHI and
Ripser as feature dimension increases, with the difference being
clearest for larger point clouds; by feature dimension 5, Ripser
outpaces GUDHI as well (Figure
[\[fig:box\]](#fig:box){reference-type="ref" reference="fig:box"}). It
is unclear whether runtime for each library grows polynomially or
exponentially (see Supplement for regression details).

Even with a constant feature dimension, the underlying data dimension
could play a role in the runtime of persistent homology calculation.
Figure [2](#fig:ann){reference-type="ref" reference="fig:ann"} compares
the handling of this issue by the Vietoris-Rips complex and the alpha
complex. Since GUDHI is the only library implementing functionality with
an alpha complex, we compare its implementations of the Vietoris-Rips
and alpha complices. Due to computational limitations, an alpha complex
could not be calculated for any point clouds with data dimensions
exceeding 3. Two notable aspects of Figure
[2](#fig:ann){reference-type="ref" reference="fig:ann"} stand out.
First, the alpha complex calculation clearly runs faster than the
Vietoris-Rips complex calculation, a trend that becomes clearer as point
cloud size increases. Second, although the Vietoris-Rips complex
calculation runtime appears to be independent of the underlying data
dimension, the alpha complex calculation is dependent on it. Figure
[2](#fig:ann){reference-type="ref" reference="fig:ann"} shows a subtle
difference between data dimensions 2 and 3 as point cloud size
increases. Although unconcerning for a data dimension up to 3, failure
to run any alpha complex calculations with a data dimension of 4 could
be cause for concern.

alpha complices.** Median runtime (min to max, $n=10$ iterations per
data point) for various data dimensions (denoted by color) are plotted

Maximum of feature dimension was kept constant at 1. Alpha complex
runtimes are linear, in contrast to polynomial Vietoris-Rips runtimes
(see Supplement for regression details).](fig6.png){#fig:ann
width="6in"}

In addition to runtime differences, the three Vietoris-Rips homology
engines differ in memory use. All three engines appeared to follow power
law growth, with a linear trend on log-log plots (Figure
[\[fig:mem\]](#fig:mem){reference-type="ref" reference="fig:mem"}).
However, for nearly all combinations of point cloud dimension and shape,
TDAstats used the least memory, and Dionysus used the most, with
TDAstats also growing with the smallest power law exponent as the number
of points increased for most point clouds. For most point clouds,
runtime and memory complexity for TDAstats (Ripser) grew with a power
function at least one degree less than the other engines (Figure
[\[fig:bigO\]](#fig:bigO){reference-type="ref" reference="fig:bigO"}).

![[]{#fig:mem label="fig:mem"}**Comparing memory use of Vietoris-Rips
persistent homology engines.** Each column title corresponds to point
cloud dimension; each row title lists point cloud shape; each persistent
homology engine is represented by points of a distinct shape and color.
For point clouds containing more than 50 points, there appears to be a
linear trend on the log-log axes. Data for 2- and 4-dimensional tori
were not collected because a torus does not trivially generalize to
dimensions other than 3. Missing points for GUDHI and Dionysus in the
4-dim plots indicate that persistent homology calculation was terminated
since memory requirement exceeded available RAM (32
GB).](fig7.pdf){#fig:memory}

![[]{#fig:bigO label="fig:bigO"}**Big-O exponents for runtime and memory
complexity as point cloud size varies.** In the majority of cases,
Ripser (and consequently, TDAstats) has the lowest exponent, indicating
the slowest growth in complexity as point cloud size increases. Due to
shape constraints, torus only has data available in the third
dimension.](fig8.pdf){#fig:bigoh}

# Discussion

As persistent homology calculations continue to become a more popular
tool to analyze complex multidimensional data, it will be important to
understand from a computational perspective which method to use. In this
paper, we examined two forms of persistent homology complexes:
Vietoris-Rips and alpha complexes. Both algorithms describe topological
features through the generation of simplicial complexes. The advantage
in saving computational time by choosing a particular algorithm depends
on point cloud characteristics.

Figure [5](#fig:fin){reference-type="ref" reference="fig:fin"} shows
that at high point cloud sizes, GUDHI's alpha complex outperforms
Ripser. Theoretically, alpha complexes gain polynomial run time
complexity as the number of points increases, whereas Vietoris-Rips
complexes gain exponential run time complexity [@roadmap]. Specifically,
alpha complexes are $O(n^{d/2})$, and Vietoris-Rips complexes are
$O(2^n)$, where $n$ is the number of points on a point cloud and $d$ is
the dimensions on the point cloud. For the conditions in our paper,
Vietoris-Rips and alpha complexes both performed better than their
theoretical maximums. Vietoris-Rips complex calculations consistently
had a polynomial growth for both runtime and memory, while alpha
complexes had linear runtime growth.

![ **Runtime comparison of persistent homology calculation between
Ripser's Vietoris-Rips and GUDHI's alpha complex functionality.** Median
runtime (min to max $n=10$ iterations per data point) for various
3-dimensional point cloud structures (facet) plotted against point cloud
size for each library (color). Benchmarking was conducted on an annulus
(top-left), a sphere (top-right), a torus (bottom-left), and a cube
(bottom-right). Data was not collected for data dimensions greater than
3 due to computational limitations of calculating alpha
complices.](fig9.png){#fig:fin width="6in"}

Based on the theoretical complexity and our results, alpha complexes are
superior for point clouds with 3 or fewer dimensions. This advantage
becomes especially clear at a high number of points. This difference in
performance is clear in both runtime and memory use. Interestingly,
while alpha complexes had overall less memory use, the memory use varied
depending on the shape. Alpha complexes seem to require more memory for
noisier data sets such as the annulus when compared to the sphere.

However, without sufficient computational resources, alpha complexes
were not usable for point cloud dimensions greater than 3. If a point
cloud has more than 3 dimensions, then it could undergo pre-processing
with dimension reduction before using alpha complexes. Note, it is
possible an algorithm will eventually be developed to enable alpha
complex computation of higher-dimensional data. However, if data
dimension cannot be reduced without significant information loss, then
Vietoris-Rips complexes should be used. It should be stated that if a
point cloud is compatible with both complexes, both analyses should be
performed as there may be a variation in the persistent homology matrix.
This is because alpha complexes satisfy the Nerve Theorem
[@alpha-complex], which implies that they are topologically equivalent
to the true underlying topology of the dataset; in contrast,
Vietoris-Rips complexes only approximate the underlying topology
[@Rips-Complex]. Among the tested Vietoris-Rips engines, Ripser (wrapped
by [TDAstats](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=TDAstats)) has the
fastest calculation time. GUDHI and Dionysus (wrapped by
[TDA](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=TDA)) significantly fall behind
as feature dimension and number of points increase.

On average, Ripser computed the persistent homology of a Vietoris-Rips
complex with less memory than either GUDHI or Dionysus. Thus, when
efficiency is critical, useRs would likely find
[TDAstats](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=TDAstats) the appropriate
library. However, [TDA](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=TDA) contains
an entire library of features not available in
[TDAstats](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=TDAstats). Specifically,
[TDA](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=TDA) allows kNN density
estimation, kernel density estimation, density-based clustering, and
dendrogram visualization, among other useful functionality. When
computational resources are plenty, when point clouds are small and
low-dimensional, or when the aforementioned functionality is required,
[TDA](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=TDA) will likely be more
appropriate than
[TDAstats](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=TDAstats). Both packages
are hosted on CRAN.

While Vietoris-Rips complexes can handle high-dimensional data well, the
calculation still significantly slows down when looking for higher
dimension features. This is evidenced by the big-O polynomial growth for
runtime and memory that have degree less than 4 for most 2-dimensional
point clouds, but degree between 4 and 6 for most 4-dimensional point
clouds (Figure [\[fig:bigO\]](#fig:bigO){reference-type="ref"
reference="fig:bigO"}); even higher degree complexities should be
expected as point cloud dimension increases. Thus, finding
high-dimensional topological features in high-dimensional point clouds
remains a challenge. Methods to calculate persistent homology do exist
for other simplicial complexes, such as the Delaunay complex and the
Witness complex, but, to our knowledge, they are not currently
implemented in CRAN packages. Future challenges would be creating and
implementing algorithms that reduce the computational complexity of
higher-dimensional topological feature calculations for R.
