title: Benchmarking R packages for Calculation of Persistent Homology
abstract: Several persistent homology software libraries have been implemented in
  R. Specifically, the Dionysus, GUDHI, and Ripser libraries have been wrapped by
  the **TDA** and **TDAstats** CRAN packages. These software represent powerful analysis
  tools that are computationally expensive and, to our knowledge, have not been formally
  benchmarked. Here, we analyze runtime and memory growth for the 2 R packages and
  the 3 underlying libraries. We find that datasets with less than 3 dimensions can
  be evaluated with persistent homology fastest by the GUDHI library in the **TDA**
  package. For higher-dimensional datasets, the Ripser library in the TDAstats package
  is the fastest. Ripser and **TDAstats** are also the most memory-efficient tools
  to calculate persistent homology.
