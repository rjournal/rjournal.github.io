title: 'tmvtnorm: A Package for the Truncated Multivariate Normal Distribution'
abstract: In this article we present tmvtnorm, an R package implementation for the
  truncated mul tivariate normal distribution. We consider random number generation
  with rejection and Gibbs sampling, computation of marginal densities as well as
  computation of the mean and covariance of the truncated variables. This contribution
  brings together latest research in this field and provides useful methods for both
  scholars and practitioners when working with truncated normal variables.
