title: 'PIN: Measuring Asymmetric Information in Financial Markets with R'
abstract: The package PIN computes a measure of asymmetric information in financial
  markets, the so-called probability of informed trading. This is obtained from a
  sequential trade model and is used to study the determinants of an asset price.
  Since the probability of informed trading depends on the number of buyand sell-initiated
  trades during a trading day, this paper discusses the entire modelling cycle, from
  data handling to the computation of the probability of informed trading and the
  estimation of parameters for the underlying theoretical model.
