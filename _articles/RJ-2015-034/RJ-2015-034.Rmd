title: Open-Channel Computation with R
abstract: The rivr package provides a computational toolset for simulating steady
  and unsteady one dimensional flows in open channels. It is designed primarily for
  use by instructors of undergraduate and graduate-level open-channel hydrodynamics
  courses in such diverse fields as river engineering, physical geography and geophysics.
  The governing equations used to describe open-channel flows are briefly presented,
  followed by example applications. These include the computation of gradually varied
  flows and two examples of unsteady flows in channelsâ€”namely, the tracking of the
  evolution of a flood wave in a channel and the prediction of extreme variation in
  the water-surface profile that results when a sluice gate is abruptly closed. Model
  results for the unsteady flow examples are validated against standard benchmarks.
  The article concludes with a discussion of potential modifications and extensions
  to the package.
