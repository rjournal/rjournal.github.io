title: Open-Channel Computation with R
abstract: The rivr package provides a computational toolset for simulating steady
  and unsteady one dimensional flows in open channels. It is designed primarily for
  use by instructors of undergraduate and graduate-level open-channel hydrodynamics
  courses in such diverse fields as river engineering, physical geography and geophysics.
  The governing equations used to describe open-channel flows are briefly presented,
  followed by example applications. These include the computation of gradually varied
  flows and two examples of unsteady flows in channels—namely, the tracking of the
  evolution of a flood wave in a channel and the prediction of extreme variation in
  the water-surface profile that results when a sluice gate is abruptly closed. Model
  results for the unsteady flow examples are validated against standard benchmarks.
  The article concludes with a discussion of potential modifications and extensions
  to the package.
