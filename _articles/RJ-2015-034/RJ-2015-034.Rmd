title: Open-Channel Computation with R
abstract: The *rivr* package provides a computational toolset for simulating steady
  and unsteady one-dimensional flows in open channels. It is designed primarily for
  use by instructors of undergraduate- and graduate-level open-channel hydrodynamics
  courses in such diverse fields as river engineering, physical geography and geophysics.
  The governing equations used to describe open-channel flows are briefly presented,
  followed by example applications. These include the computation of gradually-varied
  flows and two examples of unsteady flows in channels---namely, the tracking of the
  evolution of a flood wave in a channel and the prediction of extreme variation in
  the water-surface profile that results when a sluice gate is abruptly closed. Model
  results for the unsteady flow examples are validated against standard benchmarks.
  The article concludes with a discussion of potential modifications and extensions
  to the package.

# Introduction

Hydraulic engineers routinely rely on computational models to simulate
the flow and conveyance of water for planning and designing channels and
in-stream structures, managing reservoirs, and conducting flood damage
and risk analyses. The simulation of fluid flow is a difficult and
computationally-intensive endeavor, and simplifications are often made
in order to reduce the task to one that is feasible with regard to time
management and data availability. One of the most frequently-made
assumptions is that of one-dimensional flow. This greatly simplifies the
computation of a wide range of practically-relevant flows such as
e.g. the prediction of the movement of a flood wave in a waterway, or
the consequences of a sudden opening or closure of a control gate on the
water level in a navigation channel. In making this assumption, the flow
velocity---which in reality can vary in all three coordinate
directions---is both depth- and laterally-averaged to produce a bulk or
mean channel velocity that is a function of only time and distance along
the channel: 

$$\label{eq:1dflow}  
\overline{\overline{u}} = \frac{\displaystyle\int_{y=0}^{y=H} \displaystyle\int_{z=0}^{z=S} u(x,y,z,t) \, dy\, dz}
{\displaystyle\iint dy\, dz} = f(x,t)  (\#eq:1dflow)  $$

where $u$ is velocity, $y$ is the vertical dimension, $z$ is the lateral
(cross-channel) dimension, $t$ is time and $x$ is the along-channel
direction. The integral bounds $H$ and $S$ are the flow depth and span,
respectively. Treatment of bed friction is also frequently simplified in
practical applications by relating the bed shear stresses to the
"friction slope", which is derived from the Energy Grade Line (EGL)
equation [@leopold1953] and expressed using the semi-empirical Manning's
equation

$$\label{eq:mannings}  
S_f = \left(\frac{n \, u}{C_mR^{2/3}}\right)^2  (\#eq:mannings)  $$

where $S_f$ is the friction slope, $n$ is the empirical Manning's
coefficient and $R$ is the hydraulic radius. Manning's equation and the
EGL equation are widely used in the discipline to predict steady and
gradually-varied flow conditions. The prediction of unsteady flows is
somewhat more complex; in addition to the fact that the flow area is
different from the area of the conveying channel, the governing
equations are both non-linear and coupled. This complicates the task of
obtaining solutions that are both numerically stable and accurate
without the need for excessive computational resources.

A wide variety of software suites are available for computing steady and
unsteady flows; some of the most well-known packages are listed in
Table [1](#tab::othermodels). These packages are typically accessed via
a graphical user interface and often have specialized input and output
data formatting requirements. These software suites are capable of
modeling complex networks of irregular channels and are therefore of
great utility to engineers and practitioners working on large-scale
projects, but they also pose high barriers to entry in terms of cost,
usability and computer hardware requirements as well as in terms of
ancillary data needs. These software suites are so complex that many
developers provide training courses for utilizing the software, with the
assumption that users already possess an education or background in
river mechanics and hydraulics.

  and unsteady flow.
:::

The [*rivr*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=rivr) package [@rivr]
was designed to provide rapid solutions to steady and unsteady
one-dimensional flows in open channels. The primary purpose of the
package is to provide educators with an accessible open-source toolset
that can be used to supplement lectures with interactive examples, and
to facilitate the design of assignments that encourage students to
explore open-channel flow concepts rather than focusing on the actual
implementation of solutions. The R Project for Statistical Computing
provides an ideal platform for providing *rivr* (and educational tools
in general) to students and instructors. R is both cross-platform and
free and open-source software, meaning students can run the software on
personal computers and educational institutions do not need enter
expensive licensing agreements to provide it on institution-owned
computers. Moreover, R provides a large and comprehensive library of
functions for data visualization, analysis and export both through its
core functionality and through a diversity of packages developed and
supported by an active global community of over 2 million users,
developers and scientists. R is often referred to as a "scripting
language", meaning that code blocks or snippets can be run either in an
automated fashion or piecewise by users; scripting languages are ideal
for teaching because they support interactive programming and
exploration of data. Furthermore, support for dynamic document
generation with R via packages such as
[*knitr*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=knitr) [@yihui14] provides
an excellent mechanism for instructors to develop teaching materials
that place concept and implementation side by side, as well as a
promising format for students to submit assignments and reports.
Finally, R provides the potential for instructors with virtually no web
development proficiency to create interactive web-based tutorials and
demonstrations using the
[*shiny*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=shiny) web application
framework [@shiny-2015-30].

The flow algorithms provided by *rivr* are implemented in C++ and
integrated into the package using
[*Rcpp*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=Rcpp) [@rcpp] to leverage
the speed advantage of compiled code. All algorithms were developed from
the ground up and are based on well-established, peer-reviewed
contributions to the field. Functions are provided for computing normal
and critical depth, channel geometry and conveyance, and
gradually-varied flow profiles. The package also provides an advanced
function which implements two canonical formulations of unsteady
flow---the Kinematic Wave Model and the Dynamic Wave Model---which are
routinely taught in graduate-level courses in hydrology and open-channel
hydraulics. The numerical schemes implemented in *rivr* are similarly
well-established and reflect varying degrees of sophistication that are
common topics in numerical methods courses, including implementations of
iterative solutions to implicit equations; a solution scheme for
nonlinear ordinary differential equations; and numerical methods for
solving sets of partial differential equations ranging from one of the
simplest formulations of an explicit finite-difference scheme to an
advanced two-step predictor-corrector scheme that illustrates the
trade-offs between performance and complexity of implementation.
Detailed explanation of the theoretical foundations and numerical
schemes is provided in the form of a technical vignette, and the source
code is carefully organized and commented to facilitate modifications
and extensions to the package such as new numerical schemes and
alternative formulations for steady and unsteady flow modeling.

This article provides use examples for computing both gradually-varied
and unsteady flows with *rivr*. In the first section, solutions to
gradually-varied flow or "backwater curve" problems using the
standard-step method are discussed. In the second section, solutions to
unsteady flow problems using different theoretical formulations are
described, followed by a comparison of two numerical solutions to an
unsteady flow problem with discontinuous boundary conditions. The
article concludes with a discussion of potential opportunities for
extensions and contributions to the package.

# Calculation of back-water curves

The water-surface profile resulting from non-uniform steady flow
conditions is generally referred to as a gradually-varied flow (GVF)
profile or "backwater curve". Backwater curves are commonly used for
floodplain delineation and assessing upstream effects of bridges, weirs
and other channel structures. The GVF concept is based on a simplified
form of the St. Venant equations (discussed in the following section)
and is expressed as

$$\label{eq:stvenant}  
\frac{dy}{dx} = \frac{S_0 - S_f}{1 - Fr^2}  (\#eq:stvenant)  $$

where $dy/dx$ is the water-surface slope, $S_0$ is the channel slope and
$Fr$ is the Froude Number. Eq. \@ref(eq:stvenant) describes steady-state
conditions, i.e. the channel flow rate $Q = uA$ is constant. When
$dy/dx = 0$, the flow depth is uniform and $S_0 = S_f$; the flow depth
under these conditions is referred to as the "normal depth" and can be
calculated using Manning's equation. The relative positioning of the
normal depth and the "critical depth"---the depth at which the flow
energy is minimized---determine the flow behavior. GVF profiles are
classified based on the flow regime, the channel slope and the nature of
the divergence from the steady-flow water-surface profile at a specific
location or "control section" [@doubt1970]. An M1 profile refers to
sub-critical flows where the water depth at the control section is
greater than the normal depth. An M2 profile refers to a water-surface
profile where the water depth at the control section is below the normal
depth, but above the critical depth. Other classes include "S" (steep
channels where the normal depth is shallower than the critical depth),
"C" (flow regimes where the normal depth and critical depth coincide),
"H" (flat channels) and "A" (channels of "adverse" slope, i.e. sloped
against the direction of flow).

The *rivr* package computes the GVF profile using the standard-step
method [@chaudhry2007]. A Newton-Raphson scheme is used where iterative
methods are required to find the roots of an equation. The following
example illustrates how to use *rivr* to calculate the variation of the
water-surface profile with distance, and its return to the normal-depth
level far upstream of a perturbation in flow depth. Both an M1 and an M2
profile are considered for a rectangular channel with a width of 100
feet, a slope of 0.001, a flow of 250 cubic feet per second, and a
Manning's roughness coefficient of 0.045. The water depth $y$ at the
control section is specified as 1 foot above the normal depth $y_n$ for
the M1 profile (2.71 feet) and 1.1 times the critical depth $y_c$ for
the M2 profile (0.64 feet). The elevation and x-coordinate of the
control section are both specified as zero. Example code for computing
the water-surface profile using the function `compute_profile` is shown
below.

``` r
g <- 32.2          # gravitational acceleration (ft/s^2)
Cm <- 1.486        # conversion factor for Manning's equation in US customary units 
slope <- 0.001     # channel slope (vertical ft / horizontal ft)
mannings <- 0.045  # Manning's roughness
flow <- 250        # channel flow rate (ft^3/s)
width <- 100       # channel bottom width (ft)
sideslope <- 0     # channel sideslope (horizontal ft / vertical ft)

# calculate normal depth for channel, initial guess of 2 feet
yn <- normal_depth(slope, mannings, flow, 2, Cm, width, sideslope)

# calculate critical depth, initial guess of 1 ft
yc <- critical_depth(flow, 1, g, width, sideslope)

# compute the M1 profile 3000 ft upstream with a step size of 50 ft
m1 <- compute_profile(slope, mannings, flow, yn + 1, Cm, g, 
  width, sideslope, z0 = 0, x0 = 0, stepdist = 50, totaldist = 3000)

# compute the M2 profile under the same assumptions
m2 <- compute_profile(slope, mannings, flow, 1.1 * yc, Cm, g, 
  width, sideslope, z0 = 0, x0 = 0, stepdist = 50, totaldist = 3000)
```

The effect of model resolution on results is shown in
Figure [1](#fig:resolution). For the M1 profile, the solution is quite
stable even for very coarse ($> 100$ feet) resolutions. In contrast,
solutions to the M2 profile are quite sensitive to model resolution
owing to the steep gradient in $dy/dx$ where $y \rightarrow y_c$.
However, the solution to the M2 profile is not sensitive to resolutions
finer than 10 feet. A step size of 10 feet is used in subsequent
analyses to ensure smooth calculations of the water-surface slope for
both profiles.

![Figure 1: M1 and M2 water-surface elevation profiles computed under
different resolutions. When steep gradients in the water-surface profile
are present, finer spatial resolutions are needed to provide accurate
solutions.[]{#fig:resolution
label="fig:resolution"}](fig/resfig-1.png){#fig:resolution width="100%" alt="graphic without alt text"}

Manning's coefficient is an empirical quantity that cannot be directly
measured, and engineers often rely on tabulated values to inform their
selection of a roughness value based on channel bank material and
conditions such as vegetation and compaction. It is generally necessary
to investigate the sensitivity of the solution to the choice of
Manning's roughness coefficient, or to calibrate a GVF model based on
channel depth observations. The next example considers the GVF profile
of the control section specified above for a range of Manning's
roughness values spanning 0.0225 to 0.0675.

![Figure 2: M1 and M2 water-surface elevation profiles for a range in
values for Manning's roughness coefficient.[]{#fig:roughness
label="fig:roughness"}](fig/roughplot-1.png){#fig:roughness
width="100%" alt="graphic without alt text"}

Figure [2](#fig:roughness) shows that the normal depth (apparent as the
section where the water-surface slope is linear) changes depending on
the value of the roughness coefficient; this comes as no surprise, as
the concept of normal depth is itself derived from Manning's equation.
The specification of a fixed control section depth therefore confounds
analysis of the relationship between Manning's coefficient and the
nature of the GVF profile.

In order to control for the dependence of the normal depth on Manning's
coefficient, the analysis is repeated using a control section depth of
$1.25y_n$ for the M1 profile and $0.75y_n$ for the M2 profile, where
$y_n$ is the normal depth associated with each roughness value. Note
that the critical depth is by definition independent of Manning's
coefficient. Figure [3](#fig:roughnessnorm) shows the water-surface
elevation profile as a percent difference from the normal depth for each
roughness value; it is clear from the figure that bed roughness affects
the distance that a depth disturbance propagates upstream under
sub-critical flow conditions.

![Figure 3: M1 and M2 water-surface elevation profiles as percent
difference from the normal depth under different roughness
conditions.[]{#fig:roughnessnorm
label="fig:roughnessnorm"}](fig/relroughplot-1.png){#fig:roughnessnorm
width="100%" alt="graphic without alt text"}

Note that the M1 and M2 profiles are not symmetric; that is, the point
at which the water depth returns to the normal depth from a 25% increase
in water depth at the control section is further upstream compared to
that for a 25% decrease in depth. This is because the velocity term in
the energy equation is non-linear ($u^2$) and therefore the energy
gradient is steeper for the M2 profile.

# Computation of unsteady flows

Open-channel unsteady flows are typically described using the St. Venant
equations, also known as the shallow water equations. The St. Venant
equations are derived from the Navier-Stokes equations based on a number
of simplifying assumptions, including uniform density and hydrostatic
pressure conditions. The one-dimensional St. Venant equations are
written as

$$\begin{aligned}
\label{eq:ufcont}
\frac{\partial A} {\partial t} + \frac{\partial Q}{\partial x} = 0
\end{aligned}  (\#eq:ufcont)  $$

$$\begin{aligned}
\label{eq:ufmom}  
\frac{\partial Q}{\partial t} + \frac{\partial}{\partial x} \left( Qu + 
g \overline{y} A \right) - gA\left( S_0 - S_f\right) = 0
\end{aligned}  (\#eq:ufmom)  $$

where Eq. \@ref(eq:ufcont) is the continuity, or mass conservation,
equation (assuming no infiltration or precipitation) and
Eq. \@ref(eq:ufmom) is the momentum equation. The terms $Q$, $u$, $A$
and $S_0$ and $S_f$ are as defined previously and $g$ is gravitational
acceleration. The term $\overline{y}$ results from averaging the
pressure component and refers to the distance from the free surface to
the centroid of the cross section. The *rivr* package provides multiple
methods for solving these equations to compute unsteady flows through a
prismatic channel. These methods are discussed in the following
sections.

## Simulations with the Kinematic Wave Model

The Kinematic Wave Model (KWM) provides a simplified solution to the
St. Venant equations based on a truncated momentum equation that ignores
inertial terms [@lighthill1955]. Eq. \@ref(eq:ufmom) is instead
expressed through the relation

$$A = \left( \frac{nQP^{2/3}}{C_m \sqrt{S_0}} \right)^{3/5}$$

where $P$ is the wetted perimeter and $S_0$ is substituted for $S_f$ in
Manning's equation.

The KWM engine (and other engines, as we show later) provided by *rivr*
can be called via the function `route_wave`. The behavior of the KWM is
demonstrated by using it to calculate the evolution of a flood wave down
a 100-foot wide rectangular channel that is 150,000 feet long, with a
slope of 0.001 and a Manning's roughness of 0.045. The
`boundary.condition` argument is a vector specifying the flow at the
upstream boundary for an arbitrary period of time in intervals equal to
the `timestep` argument, in seconds. The `monitor.nodes` and
`monitor.times` arguments are used to specify the function outputs. The
hydrograph (change in flow over time) at the upstream boundary, shown in
Figure [4](#fig:floodhydrograph), is modeled as a symmetrical flood wave
and is conveniently expressed as

$$\label{eq:fw}  
  Q(t) =
   \begin{cases}
    \displaystyle 250 + \frac{750}{\pi} \left(1 - \cos{\frac{\pi t}{4500} }\right) & \text{if } t \leq 9000 \\
    250       & \text{if } t \geq 9000
   \end{cases}  (\#eq:fw)  $$

where $t$ is in seconds.

![Figure 4: Flood wave hydrograph specified as the initial condition of
the unsteady flow examples.[]{#fig:floodhydrograph

monpoints <- c(1, 201, 401, 601)                  # Nodes to monitor
montimes <- seq(1, length(boundary), by = 10)     # time steps to monitor

initflow <- 250                                   # initial flow condition (ft^3/s)
times <- seq(0, 76000, by = dt)    
boundary <- ifelse(times < 9000,                  # upstream hyrograph (ft^3/s)            
  250 + (750/pi) * (1 - cos(pi * times/(4500))), 250)

route_wave(slope, mannings, Cm, g, width, sideslope, initflow, boundary, 
  timestep = dt, spacestep = dx, numnodes = numnodes, 
  monitor.nodes = monpoints, monitor.times = montimes, 
  engine = "Kinematic")
```

While the KWM is easy to use and implement, it ignores wave damping and
attenuation resulting in unrealistic predictions of the shape of the
flood wave as it progresses downstream. The truncation of
Eq. \@ref(eq:ufmom) results in what is known as "kinematic shock",
i.e. the shape of the flood wave becomes increasingly asymmetrical as it
progresses downstream. This effect is apparent in
Figure [5](#fig:routeplot-kinematic), which shows the wave front
approaching a vertical line as the flood wave travels along the channel.

![Figure 5: Progression of the flood wave calculated using the KWM
engine with a spatial resolution of 25 feet and a temporal resolution of
12 seconds.[]{#fig:routeplot-kinematic
label="fig:routeplot-kinematic"}](routeplot-kinematic.gif){#fig:routeplot-kinematic
width="100%" alt="graphic without alt text"}

The *rivr* package implements the KWM with an explicit, first-order
accurate backwards-difference scheme. While such schemes are simple to
conceptualize and implement, they are sensitive to numerical error and
can be unstable. A necessary condition for stability is that the Courant
Number $C$ is less than unity,
i.e. $$C \equiv \frac{u \Delta t}{\Delta x} \leq 1$$ where $u$ is
defined here as the initial velocity at the upstream boundary and
$\Delta x$ and $\Delta t$ are the spatial and temporal resolution of the
model. Numerical error is propagated through successive calculations and
results in a systematic decrease in the accuracy of the solution as the
flood wave progresses downstream, apparent in
Figure [5](#fig:routeplot-kinematic) as a decreasing peak flow
magnitude. The sensitivity of the solution generated by the KWM engine
to model resolution is assessed by varying $\Delta x$ and $\Delta t$
while maintaining a Courant number of 0.7 to ensure numerical stability.
The effect of numerical error on model accuracy is inferred by
evaluating the shape of the hydrograph at a cross-section 50,000 feet
downstream.

![Figure 6: Evolution of the flood wave hydrograph 50,000 feet
downstream using the KWM engine, for a variety of model resolutions.
Note that at coarser resolutions the wave appears to attenuate, but this
is solely the result of numerical error.[]{#fig:xsectionkinematic
label="fig:xsectionkinematic"}](fig/xsectionplot-kinematic-1.png){#fig:xsectionkinematic
width="100%" alt="graphic without alt text"}

Figure [6](#fig:xsectionkinematic) shows the shape of the flood wave at
said cross-section for selected spatial resolutions. As resolution
decreases, the peak flow downstream decreases due to the effects of
numerical error. In addition, the severity of the kinematic shock
decreases with decreasing resolution due to greater numerical
dispersion. Numerical error can be reduced by applying finer model
resolutions at the cost of increased computation time.
Table [2](#tbl:peakstablekinematic) summarizes the effect of model
resolution on the peak flow value 50,000 feet downstream; for the
example shown here, increasing the model resolution incurs substantial
costs in computation time with diminishing returns on accuracy for
spatial resolutions finer than 50 feet.

## Simulations with the Dynamic Wave Model

The previous example showed that the KWM gives unrealistic predictions
of a flood wave routed through a prismatic channel with mild slope. This
is largely due to the exclusion of inertial forces by truncating the
momentum equation. Unsteady flow models that solve complete forms of
Eq. \@ref(eq:ufmom), known as Dynamic Wave Models (DWMs), can provide
more realistic simulations of unsteady flow. The *rivr* package provides
a DWM engine accessed in a similar manner to the KWM engine. The DWM
engine uses the MacCormack predictor-corrector scheme [@maccormack1969]
to provide solutions that are second-order accurate in space. As shown
in Figure [7](#fig:routeplot-characteristic), flood waves modeled with
the DWM attenuate as they travel through the channel.

The DWM engine differs from the KWM engine in that the downstream
boundary condition must be known. The *rivr* package employs the Method
of Characteristics (MOC) to resolve fluid flow across the upstream and
downstream boundaries. By using MOC, the DWM engine can accommodate a
variety of boundary specifications; the upstream and downstream
boundaries can be individually specified in terms of either flows or
water depths. The downstream boundary can alternatively be specified as
a zero-gradient condition, which allows flow to be routed out of the
channel by assuming that the flow or water depth is constant across the
final (downstream) two nodes in the model domain. This results in
"smearing" of the flood wave at the downstream boundary, but in some
practical cases this may be preferable to direct specification of depth
or flow. When depths are specified at the boundaries, the characteristic
equations are solved directly; when flows are specified, a
Newton-Raphson scheme is used to iteratively solve for depths and
velocities simultaneously.

To illustrate use of the DWM, the example from the previous section is
repeated. The channel geometry, extent and upstream boundary condition
are unchanged. A zero-gradient condition is specified at the downstream
boundary. Example code using the DWM engine is shown below.

``` r
slope <- 0.001       # channel slope (vertical ft / horizontal ft)
extent <- 150000     # channel length (ft)
mannings <- 0.045    # Manning's roughness
width <- 100         # channel bottom width
sideslope <- 0       # channel side slope (horizontal ft / vertical ft)
Cm <- 1.486          # conversion factor for Manning's equation
g <- 32.2            # gravitational acceleration (ft/s^2)

numnodes <- 601                    # number of finite-difference nodes
dx <- extent/(numnodes - 1)        # distance between nodes (ft)
dt <- 100                          # time interval (s)

monpoints <- c(1, 201, 401, 601)                  # Nodes to monitor
montimes <- seq(1, length(boundary), by = 10)     # time steps to monitor

initflow <- 250                                   # initial flow condition (ft^3/s)
times <- seq(0, 76000, by = dt)    

boundary <- ifelse(times < 9000,                  # upstream hyrograph (ft^3/s)            
  250 + (750/pi) * (1 - cos(pi * times/(4500))), 250)
downstream <- rep(-1, length(boundary))           # values < 0 specify zero-gradient

route_wave(slope, mannings, Cm, g, width, sideslope, initflow, boundary, 
  downstream, timestep = dt, spacestep = dx, numnodes = numnodes, 
  monitor.nodes = mpoints, monitor.times = mtimes, engine = "Dynamic", 
  boundary.type = "QQ")		
```

The DWM engine, like the KWM engine, uses an explicit scheme and is
subject to stability constraints. In fact, the DWM engine is more prone
to numerical instability compared to the KWM engine and typically
requires Courant numbers on the order of 0.06 (i.e. an
order-of-magnitude increase in the required temporal resolution compared
to the KWM engine for a given spatial resolution). This disadvantage is
offset by a significant reduction in numerical error provided by the
advanced finite-differencing scheme. As shown in
Figure [8](#fig:xsectioncharacteristic), spatial resolutions of 1,000
feet provide accurate predictions at 50,000 feet downstream, at the cost
of severe instability near the downstream boundary. Resolutions of 500
feet provide stable solutions throughout the full channel extent for a
modest computation cost, as shown in
Table [3](#tbl:peakstablecharacteristic).

data from @sobey01 are shown as points. The solution becomes unstable at

## Simulations with discontinuous boundary conditions

The DWM engine can accommodate boundary conditions that specify zero
flows (velocities) but non-zero depths, such as can occur by the sudden
closure of sluice gates. The last unsteady-flow example illustrates use
of the DWM engine to simulate unsteady flow conditions following sudden
closure of a sluice gate at the downstream end of a trapezoidal
spillway. This example mimics example 14-1 in @chaudhry2007. The
upstream boundary condition is specified as a constant depth to
represent water level in a large reservoir. Example code for specifying
discontinuous boundary conditions is shown below.

``` r
slope <- 0.00008          # channel slope (vertical m / horizontal m)
extent <- 5000            # channel length (m)
mannings <- 0.013         # Manning's roughness
width <- 6.1              # channel width (m)
sideslope <- 1.5          # channel sideslope (horizontal m / vertical m)
g <- 9.81                 # gravitational acceleration (m/s^2)
Cm <- 1.0                 # conversion factor for Manning's equation (SI units)
extent <- 5000            # channel length (m)

numnodes <- 51                           # number of nodes
dx <- extent/(numnodes - 1)              # spatial resoution (m)
dt <- 10                                 # temporal resolution (s)

mp <- c(1, 16, 26, 31, 51)               # monitor nodes
mt <- c(1, 61, 101, 161, 201)            # monitor time steps

ic <- 126                                # initial condition (m^3/s)
bctime <- 2000
bc <- rep(5.79, round(bctime/dt) + 1)    # constant depth upstream (m)
dc <- rep(0, length(bc))                 # flow dropped to 0 on first timestep

results <- route_wave(slope, mannings, Cm, g, width, sideslope, ic, bc, dc, 
  timestep = dt, spacestep = dx, numnodes = numnodes, engine = "Dynamic", 
  boundary.type = "yQ", monitor.nodes = mp, monitor.times = mt)
```

![Figure 9: Evolution of the water-surface profile through time
following sudden closure of a control gate. The Lax scheme produces
smoother profiles, while the MacCormack scheme predicts steeper
gradients and produces small numerical
instabilities.[]{#fig:through-time
label="fig:through-time"}](through-time.gif){#fig:through-time
width="100%" alt="graphic without alt text"}

Figure [9](#fig:through-time) shows that the MacCormack scheme can
produce small instabilities in the solution where gradients are high.
The *rivr* package provides access to an alternative DWM engine---the
Lax diffusive scheme [@lax1954]---which is also second-order accurate in
space. Whereas the Lax scheme is less accurate than the MacCormack
scheme at coarser resolutions, it can provide smoother solutions to
discontinuous boundary problems. The Lax scheme can be accessed with
`route_wave` via the argument `scheme = "Lax"`.

# Opportunities for extension

The *rivr* package was designed such that additional analysis
capabilities could be implemented in future versions with minimal
modification to the existing code base. A wide variety of extensions
could be supported by the existing interface, both in terms of numerical
methods and problem complexity. In particular, there are many avenues
for contribution to the unsteady flow analysis capabilities of *rivr*.

Additional numerical schemes for unsteady flow analysis in prismatic
channels---such as implicit finite-difference schemes and finite-element
methods---could be implemented with only superficial changes to the
current function interface provided by `route_wave`, i.e. new algorithms
could be made accessible through additional keyword options in existing
arguments provided the underlying engines followed the input template
used by the KWM and DWM engines. Variable-step methods could also be
implemented with minimal changes, most simply by allowing the user to
define an initial or "default" time step and using an interpolation
function to compute the upstream boundary condition at intermediate time
steps when required. The authors consider the degree of effort required
to implement such additional numerical schemes in *rivr* to be on par
with typical expectations for an individual project assignment in a
graduate-level computational hydraulics or numerical methods course.

Support for prismatic channels with arbitrary or compound geometry could
be accomplished with only minor restructuring of the channel geometry
function, but would introduce additional complexity to the specification
of channel roughness [@yen2002] and the computation of normal and
critical depth [@hanif1988; @younis2009]. Support for compound channels
is currently being considered for the next major version release of
*rivr*.

Specification of variable channel geometry and slope, additional
friction terms (e.g. bedform drag, hydraulic structures) and additional
source or sink terms (e.g. hillslope runoff, infiltration) would require
some modification to the current implementation but would largely
consist of allowing users to specify channel properties as vectors
rather than as single values, and modifying the underlying C++ code to
access the appropriate vector elements when computing solutions at
individual nodes. These modifications would best be developed prior to,
or in conjunction with, the implementation of an implicit scheme. Such
changes would, however, add considerable complexity to the formulation
of unsteady flow problems and could potentially distract from the
primary purpose of the package as an accessible tool for teaching.

Support for channel networks would likely require the development of a
new function interface that would essentially couple three or more
instances of `route_wave` (e.g. two channels merging into one) and
provide a keyword argument for selecting different methods for resolving
flow depth and velocity at the junctions. Implementing such
functionality would likely be a much larger endeavor compared to the
other extensions discussed, and could pose additional challenges in
terms of obtaining reasonably-fast solutions for moderately-large
channel networks. It is important to note, however, that discussion of
channel network modeling is often neglected in open-channel hydraulics
courses due to the high complexity of problem formulation and solution
algorithms; making channel network solution algorithms demonstrable
through *rivr* would therefore be of considerable educational value.

# Concluding remarks

This article describes *rivr*, a first-of-its-kind R/C++ package for
one-dimensional open-channel flow computation with educational
applications to hydraulic engineering degree programs and related
disciplines. The package provides a reliable and flexible toolset for
modeling open-channel flows via a simple function interface. Model
outputs are formatted to facilitate analysis, tabulation, visualization
and export. Example computations of backwater curves and flood wave
routing are provided to demonstrate functionality and validate model
results, and potential extensions to the package are discussed. This
article, along with the package documentation, provides information on
the governing equations and numerical implementations as well as a suite
of use examples.
