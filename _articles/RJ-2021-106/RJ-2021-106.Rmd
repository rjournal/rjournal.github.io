title: 'RPESE: Risk and Performance Estimators Standard Errors with Serially Dependent
  Data'
abstract: The R package RPESE (Risk and Performance Estimators Standard Errors) implements
  a new method for computing accurate standard errors of risk and performance estimators
  when returns are serially dependent. The new method makes use of the representation
  of a risk or performance estimator as a summation of a time series of influence-function
  (IF) transformed returns, and computes estimator standard errors using a sophisticated
  method of estimating the spectral density at frequency zero of the time series of
  IF-transformed returns. Two additional packages used by RPESE are introduced, namely
  RPEIF which computes and provides graphical displays of the IF of risk and performance
  estimators, and RPEGLMEN which implements a regularized Gamma generalized linear
  model polynomial fit to the periodogram of the time series of the IF-transformed
  returns. A Monte Carlo study shows that the new method provides more accurate estimates
  of standard errors for risk and performance estimators compared to well-known alternative
  methods in the presence of serial correlation.
