title: 'RPESE: Risk and Performance Estimators Standard Errors with Serially Dependent
  Data'
abstract: The R package [*RPESE*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=RPESE) (Risk
  and Performance Estimators Standard Errors) implements a new method for computing
  accurate standard errors of risk and performance estimators when returns are serially
  dependent. The new method makes use of the representation of a risk or performance
  estimator as a summation of a time series of influence-function (IF) transformed
  returns, and computes estimator standard errors using a sophisticated method of
  estimating the spectral density at frequency zero of the time series of IF-transformed
  returns. Two additional packages used by [*RPESE*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=RPESE)
  are introduced, namely [*RPEIF*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=RPEIF) which
  computes and provides graphical displays of the IF of risk and performance estimators,
  and [*RPEGLMEN*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=RPEGLMEN) which implements a
  regularized Gamma generalized linear model polynomial fit to the periodogram of
  the time series of the IF-transformed returns. A Monte Carlo study shows that the
  new method provides more accurate estimates of standard errors for risk and performance
  estimators compared to well-known alternative methods in the presence of serial
  correlation.

# Introduction

In the risk and portfolio management industry, risk and performance
estimators are standard tools used in data-driven decision-making
processes. The current industry practice in reporting risk and
performance estimates for individual assets and portfolios typically do
not include their standard error (SE) estimates. For this reason,
consumers of such reports have no way of knowing the statistical
accuracy of the estimates. As a leading example, one seldom sees SEs
reported for Sharpe ratios, and consequently cannot tell whether or not
two Sharpe ratios for two different portfolios or assets are
significantly different. This motivated the development of the Risk and
Performance Estimator Standard Errors package,
[*RPESE*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=RPESE), for computing risk
and performance estimator standard errors that are accurate when returns
that are serially correlated and can have fat-tailed and skewed
non-normality of returns distributions.
[*RPESE*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=RPESE) uses a new method
for computing risk and performance estimators standard errors developed
by @chen2021.

In the quantitative finance literature, numerous statistical methods
have been proposed to evaluate the variability of risk and performance
estimators under the assumption of independent and identically
distributed (i.i.d.) returns. These methods are however inadequate when
returns are serially correlated. An example of this was provided by
@lo2002statistics, who showed that the Sharpe ratio estimator standard
error based on the assumption of i.i.d. returns is overly optimistic
when returns are actually serially correlated. In terms of statistical
methods to compute standard errors of estimators when working with time
series data exhibiting serial correlation, there are two well-known
methods in the literature: the nonparametric heteroskedasticity and
autocorrelation consistent (HAC) covariance method
[@newey1987hac; @andrews1991heteroskedasticity; @zeileis2004econometric]
and the nonparametric block bootstrap method
[@Kunsch1989; @Politis1994]. HAC covariance estimators, which rely on a
kernel-based approach on the lag-$k$ covariance estimates of the time
series, possess desirable statistical properties such as consistency
under heteroscedasticity and autocorrelation. Block bootstrap methods
have been shown to provide accurate standard errors if they are well
calibrated [@Ledoit2008]. However, they rely on randomness which is an
unappealing feature for industry practitioners as different results can
be reported on the same data set, albeit small if a large enough number
of replicates are used.

Unlike the nonparametric HAC and block bootstrap methods, the method
implemented in the [*RPESE*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=RPESE)
package is a fully parametric and deterministic method for computing
risk and performance estimators standard errors for time series with
serial correlation, which is an appealing feature for the purpose of
constructing confidence intervals and tests. While IFs are commonly used
tools in robust statistics, they are seldomly used in quantitative
finance research and applications. The new method involves the
representation of the risk and performance estimators using influence
functions (IFs) and fitting a penalized Gamma generalized linear model
(GLM) to the periodogram of the IF-transformed returns time series. The
estimate of the variance of the estimator can be obtained from the
spectral density estimate of the IF-transformed returns time series at
zero frequency, a technique introduced by @heidelberger1981spectral.

The remainder of this article is organized as follows. The \"New
Methodology: Standard Errors via Influence Functions\" section provides
the theoretical and computational details of the new method to compute
standard errors of risk and performance estimators. The \"Influence
Functions for Risk and Performance Estimators\" section presents five
risk estimators and seven performance estimators with their influence
functions, and introduces the
[*RPEIF*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=RPEIF) package with some
sample code for the purpose of computing and providing graphical
displays of such influence functions. The \"Periodogram Based
Generalized Linear Model Method\" section describes the computational
details of the Gamma GLM fit to the periodogram of the IF-transformed
returns time series and briefly discusses the implementation in the
[*RPEGLMEN*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=RPEGLMEN) package. The
\"Application: Hedge Funds Data Standard Errors with
[*RPESE*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=RPESE)\" section provides
example code to compute standard errors for hedge funds returns data.
The \"Monte Carlo Study with IF-Based Standard Errors\" section presents
a benchmark comparison of the new method with two HAC based approaches
for serially correlated data. The \"Summary\" section discusses future
developments for the new method and the
[*RPESE*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=RPESE) package.

# New Methodology: Standard Errors via Influence Functions

IFs were first introduced by @Hampel1974, and were developed further by
@Hampel1986. In this section, we provide the definition and basic
properties of influence functions, with a view toward their use for
understanding the influence of outliers on risk and performance
estimators, and for computing standard errors of such estimators for
both uncorrelated and serially correlated returns.

## Risk and Performance Estimator Functional Representations

The large-sample value (as sample size $n$ tends to infinity) of a risk
or performance estimator may be represented as a functional $T=T(F)$ of
the marginal distribution function $F$ of a time series
$r_{1},r_{2},\dots,r_{n}$ of returns.[^1] For example the functional for
the mean (expected value) is

$$\label{eq: meanFunctional}
\mu(F)=\int rdF(r)   (\#eq:-meanFunctional)$$
and the functional for the standard deviation (returns volatility) is
$$\label{eq: stdDevFunctional}
\sigma(F)=\bigg[\int(r-\mu(F))^{2}dF(r)\bigg]^{\frac{1}{2}}.   (\#eq:-stdDevFunctional)$$

Given a functional representation $T(F)$ of an estimator, a
finite-sample *non-parametric* estimator $T_{n}$ is easily obtained by
replacing the unknown distribution $F$ by the empirical distribution
$F_{n}$ that has a jump of height $1/n$ at each of the observed returns
values $r_{1},r_{2},\dots,r_{n}$:
$$T_{n}=T(F_{n})=T(r_{1},r_{2},\dots,r_{n}).$$
For example, the finite-sample non-parametric estimators of the mean and
standard deviation are the sample mean and sample standard deviation,
respectively:
$$\label{eq: sampleMeanAndStdDev}
\hat{\mu}_{n}=\frac{1}{n}\sum_{t=1}^{n}r_{t}\qquad\hat{\sigma}_{n}=\bigg[\frac{1}{n}\sum_{t=1}^{n}(r_{t}-\hat{\mu}_{n})\bigg]^{\frac{1}{2}}.   (\#eq:-sampleMeanAndStdDev)$$

We note that one can also derive parametric estimators from parametric
functional representation obtained by replacing $F$ by $F_{\theta}$,
where $\theta$ is the parameter vector for a parametric distribution
function. In this case one obtains the finite-sample estimator by
replacing the unknown parameter by its estimator, typically the
maximum-likelihood estimator (MLE). See for example, @Martin2019 for a
treatment of parametric and non-parametric expected shortfall (ES)
estimators for normal and $t$-distributions. However, the current
version of the [*RPEIF*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=RPEIF)
package only deals with non-parametric risk and performance estimators.

## Estimator Influence Function Definition

IFs are based on the use of the following mixture distribution
perturbation of a fixed target distribution $F(x)$ :
$$F_{\gamma}(x)=(1-\gamma)F(x)+\gamma\delta_{r}(x),\,0\le\gamma<1/2$$
where $\delta_{r}(x)$ is a point mass discrete distribution function
with a jump of height one located at value $r$ . The IF of an estimator
with functional form $T(F)$ is defined as:
$$IF(r;T,F)=\lim\limits _{\gamma\to0}\frac{T(F_{\gamma})-T(F)}{\gamma}=\frac{d}{d\gamma}T(F_{\gamma})|_{\gamma=0}$$

The IF is a special directional derivative (i.e., a Gateaux derivative)
of the functional $T(F)$ in the direction of a point mass distributions
$\delta_{r}$, evaluated at $F$. It is straightforward, and more or less
tedious, to derive formulas for the IFs of risk and performance
estimators. For example, the IF of the sample mean is:
$$\label{eq: IFmuAndStdDev}
IF(r;\mu;F)=r-\mu   (\#eq:-IFmuAndStdDev)$$
where $\mu=\mu(F)$ depends on the underlying returns marginal
distribution $F$. The above influence function has the property that its
expected value is zero, which is a reflection of the general property
than an influence function has zero expected value [@Hampel1974]:
$$\label{eq: zeroMeanOfIF}
E\left[IF(r;T,F)\right]=0.   (\#eq:-zeroMeanOfIF)$$

## A Key Influence Function Property

A key IF property is that for well behaved estimator functionals, the
finite-sample estimator $T_{n}=T(F_{n})=T(r_{1},r_{2},\dots,r_{n})$ can
be expressed in terms of the sample mean of IF transformed returns as
$$T_{n}-T(F)=\frac{1}{n}\sum_{t=1}^{n}IF(r_{t};T,F)+remainder$$
where the remainder goes to zero in a probabilistic sense as
$n\to\infty$. Thus the finite sample variance of $T_{n}$ is
approximately given by
$$\label{eq: EstVar}
Var\left(T_{n}\right)=Var\left[\frac{1}{n}\sum_{t=1}^{n}IF(r_{t};T,F)\right]   (\#eq:-EstVar)$$
and in the special case where the returns $r_{t}$ are i.i.d., the
IF-transformed returns are i.i.d., and the variance of $T_{n}$ reduces
to
$$\label{eq: iidEstVar}
Var\left(T_{n}\right)=\frac{1}{n}E[IF^{2}(r_{1};T,F)].   (\#eq:-iidEstVar)$$
and the expectation on the right-hand side can be evaluated empirically
as the sample mean of the squared influence functions.

However, when the $r_{t},t=1,2,\dots,n$ are serially dependent, such as
in the case of serially correlated AR(1) returns or serially
uncorrelated but dependent GARCH(1,1) returns, the IF-transformed
returns time series $IF(r_{t};T,F)$ will generally have serial
correlation that needs to be accounted for in calculating the variance
on the the right-hand-side of (\@ref(eq:-EstVar)). In particular,
$$\label{eq:corr_eq}
\frac{1}{n} Var\left[\sum_{i=1}^{n} IF(r_t; T, F) \right] = C_{IF}(0) + 2 \sum_{k=1}^{n-1}\left(1 - \frac{k}{n}\right)C_{IF}(k),   (\#eq:corr-eq)$$
where $C_{IF}(k)$ is the symmetric lag-$k$ covariance between $IF(r_t)$
and $IF(r_{t+k})$. Spectral analysis theory, extensively used in science
and engineering, shows that the variance of the sum of the values of a
serially correlated stationary time series is given by the spectral
density of the time series at zero frequency. Thus the problem of
estimating the variance (\@ref(eq:-EstVar)), with possibly serially
correlated returns, reduces to the problem of estimating the spectral
density at zero frequency of the the time series $IF(r_{t};T,F)/n$.
@chen2021 show how to do this by a polynomial Gamma GLM fitting method,
with elastic net (EN) regularization, that works well when the returns
are serially correlated, as well as when they are uncorrelated. Their
methodology is implemented in the
[*RPESE*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=RPESE) package, which in
turn makes fundamental use of the
[*RPEIF*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=RPEIF) package to compute
and provide graphical displays for the influence functions of popular
risk and performance estimators, and the
[*RPEGLMEN*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=RPEGLMEN) to fit a
polynomial Gamma GLM with EN penalty to the IF-transformed returns time
series periodogram.

# Influence Functions for Risk and Performance Estimators

The current version (1.2.2) of the
[*RPESE*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=RPESE) package supports six
risk and nine performance estimators. The risk estimators are the sample
standard deviation (SD), the semi-standard deviation (SemiSD), the lower
partial moment of order one and two (LPM1 and LPM2), the expected
shortfall (ES) and the value-at-risk (VaR), the latter two risk
estimators with tail probability $\alpha$. The performance estimators
are the mean (Mean), a robust M-estimator of the mean (robMean) of
$\psi$-type[^2], the Sharpe ratio (SR), the downside Sharpe ratio (DSR),
the Sortino ratio (SoR) with constant threshold $c$, the expected
shortfall ratio (ESratio) and the value-at-risk ratio (VaRratio) with
tail probability $\alpha$, the Rachev ratio (RachevRatio) with lower and
upper tail probability $\alpha$ and $\beta$, and the Omega ratio
(OmegaRatio) with constant threshold $c$.

The formulas for these risk and performance estimators and their
functional representations, and the derivations of their influence
function formulas, are given in [@zhang2021influence]. In Table
[1](#tab:rpe_names), the names of the functions in the
[*RPEIF*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=RPEIF) and
[*RPESE*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=RPESE) packages for the
risk and performance estimators are provided.

  performance estimators.
:::

## The [*RPEIF*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=RPEIF) Package

The functions in the [*RPEIF*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=RPEIF)
package listed in Table [1](#tab:rpe_names) are used for two distinct
purposes. The first is to evaluate an estimator IF at a set of data
values, and plot them to display a graph of the influence function. This
allows the user to explore the different shapes of the IFs of different
estimators. The second and primary purpose of these IF functions is to
compute IF-transformed time series of returns, as a first step in the
overall method of computing standard errors for risk and performance
estimators.

To briefly demonstrate the usage of the
[*RPEIF*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=RPEIF) package, the `edhec`
data set available in the
[*PerformanceAnalytics*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=PerformanceAnalytics)
package will be used. This data set contains hedge fund returns from
January, 1997 to November, 2019. The data can be loaded as an `xts` time
series object with the following R code.

``` r
install.packages("PerformanceAnalystics")
data(edhec, package = "PerformanceAnalytics")
class(edhec)

## [1] "xts" "zoo"
```

The hedge fund names in `edhec` are too long to display well in plots.
The following code replaces those long names with shorter names.

``` r
colnames(edhec) <- c("CA", "CTAG", "DIS", "EM", "EMN", "ED", "FIA", "GM", "LS", "MA",
                     "RV", "SS", "FoF")
```

The following functions are available in
[*RPEIF*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=RPEIF):

``` r
library(RPEIF)
ls("package:RPEIF")

 [1] "IF"             "IF.DSR"         "IF.ES"          "IF.ESratio"    
 [5] "IF.LPM"         "IF.Mean"        "IF.OmegaRatio"  "IF.RachevRatio"
 [9] "IF.robMean"     "IF.SD"          "IF.SemiSD"      "IF.SoR"        
[13] "IF.SR"          "IF.VaR"         "IF.VaRratio"    "nuisParsFn"
```

In order to compute the values and plot the shapes of influence
functions using the IF functions in Table [1](#tab:rpe_names), nuisance
parameters need to be specified, and there are two basic methods of
doing so. Using the `nuisParsFn` function, nuisance parameters can be
generated by specifying \"typical\" values based on some assumed returns
distribution. For the risk measure estimators and performance measure
estimators, the `nuisParsFn` function assumes by default that the
returns follow the normal distribution, with monthly mean return of
$\mu =  1\%$, risk-free rate $rf = 0\%$, monthly volatility of
$\sigma=5\%$ (the corresponding annual mean and volatility are 12% and
17.3%, respectively), and in addition assumes by default that $c=0$ for
LPM and SoR, $\alpha = 0.10$ for VaR and ES, and in addition
$\beta = 0.10$ for the Rachev ratio. Thus:

``` r
args(nuisParsFn)

## function (mu = 0.01, sd = 0.05, c = 0, alpha = 0.1, beta = 0.1)
```

To generate nuisance parameters by using a mean return of $2\%$ instead
of $1\%$ and a volatility of $15\%$ instead of $5\%$ (the defaults) for
the purpose of displaying the IF plots for the SD and the SR, the
`nuisPars` argument can be used as in the following code, with the plots
shown in Figure [2](#fig:shape_function).

``` r
par(mfrow = c(2, 1))
outSD <- IF.SD(evalShape = T, IFplot = T, nuisPars = nuisParsFn(mu = 0.02, sd = 0.15))
outSR <- IF.SR(evalShape = T, IFplot = T, nuisPars = nuisParsFn(mu = 0.02, sd = 0.15))
```

![Figure 2: IF shapes of SD and SR with user-specified nuisance
parameters.](twoIFsnewNuisancePars.png){#fig:shape_function width="100%"
alt="graphic without alt text"}

The second way to specify nuisance parameter values is to estimate them
from a returns time series of interest, the latter of which is specified
by using the argument `returns` of the IF functions. For example, the
Convertible Arbitrage (CA) hedge fund time series can be used for this
purpose by using the following code, the results of which are shown in
Figure [3](#fig:shape_returns).

``` r
par(mfrow = c(2, 1))
outSD <- IF.SD(returns = edhec$CA, evalShape = T, IFplot = T)
outSR <- IF.SR(returns = edhec$CA, evalShape = T, IFplot = T)
```

![Figure 3: IF shapes of SD and SR with estimated nuisance
parameters.](twoIFsEstimatedNuisancePars.png){#fig:shape_returns
width="100%" alt="graphic without alt text"}

To plot the IF-transformed returns of the SD and SR estimators, use the
following code to generate the output shown in Figure
[4](#fig:IF_plots):

``` r
SDiftr <- IF.SD(returns = edhec$CA)
SRiftr <- IF.SR(returns = edhec$CA)
par(mfrow = c(3, 1))
plot(edhec$CA, lwd = 0.8, ylab = "Returns", main = "CA Hedge Fund Returns")
plot(SDiftr, lwd = 0.8, main = "IF.SD Transformed Returns")
plot(SRiftr, lwd = 0.8, main = "IF.SR Transformed Returns")
```

![Figure 4: SD and SR IF-transformed returns for CA hedge fund.
](twoIFsTransformedReturns.png){#fig:IF_plots width="100%"
alt="graphic without alt text"}

Returns data are prone to outliers which adversely influence parameter
estimates and inflate the standard errors of risk and performance
estimators. A very reliable outlier cleaning method that shrinks
outliers can be obtained based on a robust location M-estimator and an
associated robust scale estimator $\hat{s}$. A location M-estimator is
computed as a solution of the equation
$$\label{eq: mestEqn}
\sum_{t=1}^{n}\psi_{mOpt}\left(\dfrac{r_{t}-{\hat{\mu}_{M}}}{\hat{s}}\right)=0   (\#eq:-mestEqn)$$
where $\psi_{mOpt}=\psi_{mOpt}(x)$ is an optimal bias robust \"psi\"
function, and $\hat{s}$ is a robust scale estimate of the residuals
$\epsilon_{t}=r_{t}-{\hat{\mu}_{M}}$. For an introduction to
location M-estimators and their computation, see Sections 2.3 and 2.7 of
[@Maronna2019]. The optimal bias robust function $\psi_{mOpt}$ is the
default used by the function `locScaleM` in the
[*RobStatTM*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=RobStatTM) package. The
`robMean` function in
[*RPESE*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=RPESE) computes the
estimates $\hat{\mu}_{M}$ and $\hat{s}$ using `locScaleM`.

Based on a location estimate $\hat{\mu}_{M}$ and associated scale
estimate $\hat{s}$, it is natural to define returns $r_{t}$ that fall
outside the interval
${\left[\hat{\mu}_{M}-3\cdot\hat{s},\hat{\mu}_{M}+3\cdot\hat{s}\right]}$
as outliers for a 95% efficiency. Such outliers are then \"cleaned\" by
shrinking them to the nearest boundary of that interval. For the Fixed
Income Arbitrage (FIA) hedge fund returns, using the optimal bias robust
$\psi_{mOpt}$ function, it turns out that the above interval is
$[-0.01171,\,0.02231]$. Correspondingly, the FIA hedge fund returns with
values less than -0.01171, or greater than 0.02231, are detected as
outliers and shrunk accordingly.

The following code results in Figure [5](#fig:IF_cleaned), which shows
the sample mean IF-transformed FIA returns (which are equal to FIA
returns minus the very small mean of the FIA returns) in the top plot,
and the outlier cleaned IF tranformaed FIA returns in the bottom plot.

``` r
iftrFIA <- IF.Mean(returns = edhec$FIA)
iftrFIAclean <- IF.Mean(returns = edhec$FIA, cleanOutliers = T)
par(mfrow = c(2, 1))
plot(iftrFIA, main = "FIA IF-transformed Returns", lwd = 0.8)
plot(iftrFIAclean, main = "Outlier Cleaned FIA IF-transformed Returns", lwd = 0.8)
```

Spectral density function estimation is a frequently used method in the
field of signal processing, and in other engineering and science
applications. Prewhitening is a technique often used to improve the
performance of spectral density estimators. Since the core of the method
described in [@chen2021] is estimation of a spectral density at
frequency zero of an IF-transformed returns time series $IF_{t}$, it is
natural to be able to use prewhitening of that time series. The
prewhitened variant of the basic IF-based SE method in the
[*RPESE*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=RPESE) package implement
such prewhitening. A prewhitened version $IF_{t}^{pw}$ of the $IF_{t}$
time series by using the prewhitening transformation
$$IF_{t}^{pw}=IF_{t}-\hat{\rho}IF_{t-1}$$
where $\hat{\rho}$ is a lag-one serial correlation coefficient estimat
of the $IF_{t}$. In general the $IF_{t}^{pw}$ series is not a serially
uncorrelated (white noise) series, but it has considerably less serial
correlation than $IF_{t}$, and a periodogram estimator based on
$IF_{t}^{pw}$ will suffer from relatively little bias compared with one
based on $IF_{t}$. Since outliers can have adverse influence not only on
risk and performance estimators, but also on the estimator $\hat{\rho}$
used for prewhitening, it is always a good idea to clean outliers before
prewhitening. This can done for example using the following code, which
results in the plot shown in Figure [6](#fig:IF_PW).

``` r
iftrFIAcl <- IF.Mean(returns = edhec$FIA, cleanOutliers = T)
PWiftrFIAcl <- IF.Mean(returns = edhec$FIA, cleanOutliers = T, prewhiten = T)
par(mfrow = c(2, 1))
plot(iftrFIAcl, main = "FIA Outlier Cleaned Returns", lwd = 0.8)
plot(PWiftrFIAcl, main = "Prewhitened FIA Outlier Cleaned Returns", lwd = 0.8)
```

# Periodogram Based GLM Method

The problem of estimating the variance (\@ref(eq:-EstVar)) of a risk or
performance estimator in the presence of serially correlated returns
reduces to estimating the spectral density at zero frequency of the time
series $IF(r_{t};T,F)/n$. To do so, @chen2021 proposed to fit a
polynomial Gamma GLM method with elastic net (EN) regularization to the
periodogram of the time series $IF(r_{t};T,F)/n$. Because of the
computationally intensive nature of the cross-validation procedure for
the tuning parameter $\lambda$ and the fact that the implementation must
be efficient enough to handle multiple assets and portfolio returns,
@GAMMA_glm developed an accelerated proximal gradient descent algorithm
for Gamma GLM with EN regularization.

## The [*RPEGLMEN*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=RPEGLMEN) Package

The accelerated proximal gradient descent algorithm by @GAMMA_glm was
implemented in the
[*RPEGLMEN*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=RPEGLMEN) package.
Multicore processing is available in the penalized Gamma GLM functions
within the package. The EN-penalized Exponential GLM is available as a
special case of the Gamma GLM. For code examples and more details on the
parallelization features in
[*RPEGLMEN*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=RPEGLMEN), see

and vignette are provided.

# Application: Hedge Funds Data Standard Errors with [*RPESE*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=RPESE)

The following functions are available in
[*RPESE*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=RPESE) are:

``` r
library(RPESE)
ls("package:RPESE")

 [1] "DSR.SE"         "ES.SE"          "ESratio.SE"     "EstimatorSE"   
 [5] "LPM.SE"         "Mean.SE"        "OmegaRatio.SE"  "printSE"       
 [9] "RachevRatio.SE" "robMean.SE"     "SD.SE"          "SemiSD.SE"     
 [13] "SoR.SE"         "SR.SE"          "VaR.SE"         "VaRratio.SE"  
```

The only argument that is required for the standard error computing
functions in [*RPESE*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=RPESE) from
Table [1](#tab:rpe_names) is the `data` argument, and if only the data
argument is supplied then the function uses the defaults of the other
arguments. The arguments for the `SD.SE` and `SR.SE` functions given
below show that the default GLM distribution is the exponential
distribution for both the SD risk estimator and the SR performance
estimator, but the `se.methods` defaults are the pair of `IFiid` and
`IFcor` for the SD estimator and the pair `IFiid` and `IFcorPW` for the
SR estimator.

``` r
args(SD.SE)

## function (data, se.method = c("IFiid", "IFcor", "IFcorAdapt",
##     "IFcorPW", "BOOTiid", "BOOTcor")[1:2], cleanOutliers = FALSE,
##     fitting.method = c("Exponential", "Gamma")[1], d.GLM.EN = 5,
##     freq.include = c("All", "Decimate", "Truncate")[1], freq.par = 0.5,
##     corOut = c("none", "retCor", "retIFCor", "retIFCorPW")[1],
##     return.coef = FALSE, ...)
```

``` r
args(SR.SE)

## function (data, rf = 0, se.method = c("IFiid", "IFcor", "IFcorAdapt",
##     "IFcorPW", "BOOTiid", "BOOTcor")[c(1, 4)], cleanOutliers = FALSE,
##     fitting.method = c("Exponential", "Gamma")[1], d.GLM.EN = 5,
##     freq.include = c("All", "Decimate", "Truncate")[1], freq.par = 0.5,
##     corOut = c("none", "retCor", "retIFCor", "retIFCorPW")[1],
##     return.coef = FALSE, ...)
```

The standard error of the SD for the hedge funds in the `edhec` package
can be computed, using the default arguments, with the following code:

``` r
SRout <- SR.SE(edhec)
```

The result returned by the function is a list. A more compact display of
the results, with rounding to three digits by default, can be obtained
using the `printSE` function, whose arguments are

``` r
args(printSE)

## function (SE.data, round.digit = 3, round.out = TRUE)
```

with the resulting output with this function for the SR is given below.

``` r
printSE(SRout)

## Standard Errors Methods

The `se.method` argument is particularly important, and the standard
error computation methods for the various choices for this argument are
as follow.

-   `"IFiid"`: This results in an influence function (IF) method based
    computation of a standard error assuming i.i.d. returns.
-   `"IFcor"`: This is the basic IF method computation of a standard
    error that takes into account serial dependence in the returns when
    the correlation is not too large. This is often the best method for
    risk estimators.
-   `"IFcorAdapt"`: This IF based method adaptively interpolates between
    IFcor and IFcorPW which is a good approach when the user is
    uncertain of the degree of serial dependence in the returns.
-   `"IFcorPW"`: This IF based method uses pre-whitening of the
    IF-transformed returns and is useful when serial correlation is
    large.
-   `"BOOTiid"`: This choice results in computing a bootstrap standard
    error assuming i.i.d. returns.
-   `"BOOTcor"`: This choice uses a block bootstrap method to compute a
    standard error that takes into account serial dependence of returns.

The two default choices of methods are:

-   `"IFiid"` and `"IFcor"` for risk estimators, and for performance
    estimators when returns serial correlation are known to be small,
    and
-   `"IFiid"` and `"IFcorPW"` for performance estimators when returns
    correlations are unknown and may be large.

The following code results in standard errors for all thirteen of the
`edhec` hedge funds, using five different methods methods.

``` r
SRout <- SR.SE(edhec, se.method = c("IFiid","BOOTiid","IFcor","IFcorPW","BOOTcor"))
printSE(SRout)

##          SR IFiid BOOTiid IFcor IFcorPW BOOTcor
## CA    0.338 0.096   0.101 0.117   0.203   0.146
## CTAG  0.180 0.060   0.062 0.057   0.057   0.039
## DIS   0.392 0.080   0.087 0.108   0.134   0.110
## EM    0.194 0.069   0.068 0.084   0.092   0.074
## EMN   0.543 0.110   0.098 0.116   0.124   0.184
## ED    0.372 0.079   0.076 0.100   0.111   0.084
## FIA   0.377 0.113   0.113 0.134   0.183   0.155
## GM    0.371 0.054   0.059 0.057   0.057   0.052
## LS    0.315 0.066   0.058 0.079   0.085   0.072
## MA    0.560 0.092   0.092 0.097   0.104   0.066
## RV    0.504 0.097   0.109 0.099   0.169   0.129
## SS   -0.041 0.061   0.065 0.072   0.072   0.076
## FoF   0.275 0.066   0.073 0.083   0.094   0.087
```

The value of including `IFiid`, along with `IFcor` and `IFcorPW` is that
it allows the user to see whether or not serial correlation results in a
difference in the standard error that assumes i.i.d. returns and the
standard error that takes into account serial dependence. If there is no
serial correlation there will not be much difference, but if there is
serial correlation the difference can be considerable.

The `BOOTiid` and `BOOTcor` methods are provided for users who want to
see how these bootstrap methods of computing standard errors compare
with the IF based methods. Previous numerical experiments indicate that
`BOOTiid` generally agrees quite well with `IFiid`, but that `BOOTcor`
is not as consistent in giving values similar to those of `IFcor`.

## Outliers Cleaning

The following code may be used to compare SR standard errors without and
with outlier cleaning.

``` r
SRout <- SR.SE(edhec, se.method = "IFcorPW", cleanOutliers = F)
SRoutClean <- SR.SE(edhec, se.method = "IFcorPW", cleanOutliers = T)
clean.compare <- data.frame(SRout$IFcorPW$se, SRoutClean$IFcorPW$se)
names(clean.compare) <- c("With Outliers", "Outliers Cleaned")
row.names(clean.compare) <- names(edhec)
round(clean.compare, 3)

##      With Outliers Outliers Cleaned
## CA           0.203            0.116
## CTAG         0.057            0.057
## DIS          0.134            0.127
## EM           0.092            0.086
## EMN          0.124            0.099
## ED           0.113            0.101
## FIA          0.183            0.116
## GM           0.057            0.060
## LS           0.085            0.083
## MA           0.104            0.094
## RV           0.169            0.106
## SS           0.072            0.073
## FoF          0.093            0.084
```

## Correlations of Returns and IF-transformed Returns

The (lag-1) correlations of the returns and IF-transformed returns time
series can be computed as part of the output using the `corOut`
argument. The options are `"retCor"`, `"retIFCor"` and `"retIFCorPW"`.
Below is example code to return the correlations for the returns and the
IF-transformed returns.

``` r
SRretCor <- SR.SE(edhec, corOut = c("retCor", "retIFCor"))
printSE(SRretCor)

##          SR IFiid IFcorPW retCor retIFCor
## CA    0.338 0.096   0.202  0.565    0.554

## FoF   0.275 0.066   0.093  0.311    0.334
```

## Gamma and Exponential Distributions

In addition to the EN-penalized Gamma GLM available for the
model-fitting step to the IF-transformed returns time series, the
EN-penalized Exponential GLM is also available in
[*RPEGLMEN*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=RPEGLMEN). While the
periodogram has an exponential distribution asymptotically, further
research may show theat the Gamma distribution provides better overall
results, particularly for non-normally distributed returns. The argument
`fitting.method` specifies the GLM choice, and the `d.GLM.EN` argument
specifies the polynomial degree for the model. By way of example, the
following code computes standard errors of the SR for the exponential
and Gamma distributions.

``` r
Clean.out <- SR.SE(edhec, se.method=c("IFiid","IFcor","IFcorPW"), cleanOutliers = T)
GammaClean.out <- SR.SE(edhec, se.method=c("IFiid","IFcor","IFcorPW"), cleanOutliers = T,      
                        fitting.method = "Gamma")
GammaExp.comparison <- cbind(printSE(Clean.out)[,4], printSE(GammaClean.out)[,4])
colnames(GammaExp.comparison) <- c("IFcorPW-Exponential", "IFcorPW-Gamma")
rownames(GammaExp.comparison) <- names(edhec)
GammaExp.comparison

```

## Decimation and Truncation of Frequencies of Discrete Fourier Transform

There is an option in the SE functions to use a decimated or truncated
percentage of the frequencies of the discrete Fourier transforms for the
periodogram in the fitting of the Gamma distributions. Decimation
implies that only certain frequencies are used, and they will be equally
spaced selections from the frequencies. Truncation implies that only a
certain percentage of the frequencies (i.e. only the first frequencies
until a certain point) will be used. By default, the standard error
functions use all the frequencies. If the argument `freq.include` is set
to \"Decimate\" or \"Truncate\" a value of 0.5 is used for the
`freq.par` argument: every second frequency is used in the decimation
case, and only the first half of the frequencies are used in the
truncation case. Below is some sample code demonstration.

``` r
SRall <- SR.SE(edhec, cleanOutliers = T, freq.include = "All")
SRdecimate <- SR.SE(edhec, cleanOutliers = T, freq.include = "Decimate", 
                    freq.par = 0.5)
SRtruncate <- SR.SE(edhec, cleanOutliers = T, freq.include = "Truncate", 
                    freq.par = 0.5)
frequency <- cbind(printSE(SRall)[,3], printSE(SRdecimate)[,3], 
                   printSE(SRtruncate)[,3])
colnames(frequency) <- c("IFcorPW-All", "IFcorPW-Decimate", "IFcorPW-Truncate")
rownames(frequency) <- names(edhec)

# Monte Carlo Study with IF-Based Standard Errors

To assess the accuracy of risk and performance estimators standard
errors for the proposed method in comparison with alternative methods
available for practitioners, a Monte Carlo simulation is carried out for
the SR estimator. The standard error methods included in the simulation
study are the IF-based method, the Newey-West (NW) HAC method
[@newey1987hac] and the Andrews (AN) HAC method
[@andrews1991heteroskedasticity], as well as their prewhitened versions
using the `nse.andrews` and `nse.nw` functions in the
[*nse*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=nse) package[^3]. The Monte
Carlo study compares the rejection probabilities of 95% confidence
intervals based on the standard error estimates of the methods. The
simulations are conducted using $N=$ 5,000 replications of AR(1)
processes with sample sizes $n=120, 240$. The normal and
$t$-distribution with $df=5$ are considered for the innovations of the
AR(1) processes, where the mean $\mu= 1\%$ and the volatility
$\sigma= 15\%$. The simulation process is as follows:

1.  A sample of size $n$ is simulated from an AR(1) process, where the
    innovations follow either the normal or $t$-distribution ($df=5$)
    with mean $\mu= 1 \%$ and volatility $\sigma= 15 \%$.

2.  The SR is estimated using the sample mean and standard deviation,
    $\widehat{SR} = \frac{\hat{\mu}-rf}{\hat{\sigma}}$.

3.  Steps 1. and 2. are repeated $N=$ 5,000 times resulting in the
    estimates $\widehat{SR}_1, \widehat{SR}_2, \dots, \widehat{SR}_N$.
    The \"true\" standard error of the SR is computed as the sample
    standard deviation of the $N$ estimates.

4.  For each of the $N$ simulated time series of returns, the standard
    error of the SR is computed using the IF, HAC AN and NW methods, as
    well as for their prewhitened versions.

5.  Based on a normal approximation for the SR, a nominal 5% error rate
    confidence interval is computed for each
    $\widehat{SR}_i, i = 1, 2, \dots, N$, where the confidence interval
    is given by
    $$\begin{aligned}
    	\left(\widehat{SR}_i - t_{\alpha/2, \, n-1} \times SE_i, \, \widehat{SR}_i + t_{\alpha/2, \, n-1} \times SE_i  \right),
    \end{aligned}$$
    and $t_{\alpha/2, n-1}$ is the $(1 - \alpha/2)$-th quantile of the
    $t$-distribution with $n-1$ degrees of freedom. The rejection
    probabilities are computed as the fraction of the $N$ replicates for
    which the replicate confidence interval does not contain the true
    SR.

Steps 1-6 of the Monte Carlo simulation study are repeated for each
combination of $n=60, 120, 240$ and $\phi=0, 0.1, \dots, 0.5$. The
results for the normally and $t$-distributed innovations are provided in
Tables [2](#tab:rej_normal) and [3](#tab:rej_t), respectively, for a
nominal error rate of $5\%$. For all of the methods, the prewhitening
step improved the rejection probabilities. The IF-PW method was the best
method overall, achieving rejection probabilities that were closest to
5% when averaging over all values of $\phi$. In particular, the IF-PW
method was also a highly competitive method even in the i.i.d. case
($\phi=0$) for both the normally and $t$-distributed innovations, across
all sample sizes considered. For a more extensive benchmark study of the
new method and HAC-based methods, including a comparison of the methods
under generalized autoregressive conditional heteroscedasticity (GARCH)
models, see @chen2021.

# Summary

This article introduced the
[*RPESE*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=RPESE) package, as well as
the related packages [*RPEIF*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=RPEIF)
and [*RPEGLMEN*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=RPEGLMEN), to
compute standard errors for risk and performance estimators using the
new methodology in @chen2021. The new methodology involves the
representation of risk and performance estimators in terms of their
IF-transformed returns, and fitting a polynomial Gamma GLM to the
spectral density of the IF time series. The
[*RPEIF*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=RPEIF) package implements
the IF computation for six risk estimators and nine performance
estimators, and provides graphical visualization tools for the IFs. The
[*RPEGLMEN*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=RPEGLMEN) implements an
accelerated proximal gradient algorithm for the computation of the
EN-penalized polynomial Gamma GLM applied to the spectral density of the
IF-transformed returns, which includes multicore parallelization
capabilities.

Code examples, real data applications and benchmark simulation studies
in this article demonstrate the user-friendly software implementation of
the method to assess the accuracy of risk and performance estimators,
providing financial risk and portfolio managers with a powerful
open-source toolbox. We note that the
[*PerformanceAnalytics*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=PerformanceAnalytics)
package uses the [*RPESE*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=RPESE)
package to make its standard errors for serially dependent data
available to the large base of quantitatiave finance users.

There is much further research that can be accomplished for the
methodology of [@chen2021] and its software implementation in
[*RPESE*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=RPESE). New risk and
performance estimators can be introduced to both
[*RPEIF*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=RPEIF) and
[*RPESE*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=RPESE). Alternative model
selection methods could be applied in
[*RPESE*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=RPESE) in addition to EN
regularization, such as AIC or BIC based model selection. The proposed
methodology could be applied to multivariate time series to study the
joint behavior of risk and performance estimators. In the latter case, a
surface fitting method will be required to apply to the multivariate
spectral density of the multivariate IF-transformed returns.
