title: 'mclust 5: Clustering, Classification and Density Estimation Using Gaussian
  Finite Mixture Models'
abstract: Finite mixture models are being used increasingly to model a wide variety
  of random phenomena for clustering, classification and density estimation. mclust
  is a powerful and popular package which allows modelling of data as a Gaussian finite
  mixture with different covariance structures and different numbers of mixture components,
  for a variety of purposes of analysis. Recently, version 5 of the package has been
  made available on CRAN. This updated version adds new covariance structures, dimension
  reduction capabilities for visualisation, model selection criteria, initialisation
  strategies for the EM algorithm, and bootstrap-based inference, making it a full-featured
  R package for data analysis via finite mixture modelling.
