title: A Tidy Data Model for Natural Language Processing using cleanNLP
abstract: Recent advances in natural language processing have produced libraries that
  extract low level features from a collection of raw texts. These features, known
  as annotations, are usually stored internally in hierarchical, tree-based data structures.
  This paper proposes a data model to represent annotations as a collection of normalized
  relational data tables optimized for exploratory data analysis and predictive modeling.
  The R package cleanNLP, which calls one of two state of the art NLP libraries (CoreNLP
  or spaCy), is presented as an implementation of this data model. It takes raw text
  as an input and returns a list of normalized tables. Specific annotations provided
  include tokenization, part of speech tagging, named entity recognition, sentiment
  analysis, dependency parsing, coreference resolution, and word embeddings. The package
  currently supports input text in English, German, French, and Spanish.
