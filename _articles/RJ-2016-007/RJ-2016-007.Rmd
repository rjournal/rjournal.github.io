title: 'Stylometry with R: A Package for Computational Text Analysis'
abstract: This software paper describes ‘Stylometry with R’ (stylo), a flexible R
  package for the high level analysis of writing style in stylometry. Stylometry (computational
  stylistics) is concerned with the quantitative study of writing style, e.g. authorship
  verification, an application which has considerable potential in forensic contexts,
  as well as historical research. In this paper we introduce the possibilities of
  stylo for computational text analysis, via a number of dummy case studies from English
  and French literature. We demonstrate how the package is particularly useful in
  the exploratory statistical analysis of texts, e.g. with respect to authorial writing
  style. Because stylo provides an attractive graphical user interface for high-level
  exploratory analyses, it is especially suited for an audience of novices, without
  programming skills (e.g. from the Digital Humanities). More experienced users can
  benefit from our implementation of a series of standard pipelines for text processing,
  as well as a number of similarity metrics.
