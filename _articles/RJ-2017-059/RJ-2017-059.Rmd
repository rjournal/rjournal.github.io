title: Simulating Probabilistic Long-Term Effects in Models with Temporal Dependence
abstract: 'The R package pltesim calculates and depicts probabilistic long-term effects
  in binary models with temporal dependence variables. The package performs two tasks.
  First, it calculates the change in the probability of the event occurring given
  a change in a theoretical variable. Second, it calculates the rolling difference
  in the future probability of the event for two scenarios: one where the event occurred
  at a given time and one where the event does not occur. The package is consistent
  with the recent movement to depict meaningful and easy-to-interpret quantities of
  interest with the requisite measures of uncertainty. It is the first to make it
  easy for researchers to interpret shortand long-term effects of explanatory variables
  in binary autoregressive models, which can have important implications for the correct
  interpretation of these models.'
