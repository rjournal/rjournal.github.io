title: 'RcppMsgPack: MessagePack Headers and Interface Functions for R'
abstract: MessagePack, or MsgPack for short, or when referring to the implementation,
  is an efficient binary serialization format for exchanging data between different
  programming languages. The RcppMsgPack package provides R with both the MessagePack
  C++ header files, and the ability to access, create and alter MessagePack objects
  directly from R. The main driver functions of the R interface are two functions
  msgpack_pack and msgpack_unpack. The function msgpack_pack serializes R objects
  to a raw MessagePack message. The function msgpack_unpack de-serializes MessagePack
  messages back into R objects. Several helper functions are available to aid in processing
  and formatting data including msgpack_simplify, msgpack_format and msgpack_map.
