title: 'neuralnet: Training of Neural Networks'
abstract: Artificial neural networks are applied in many situations. neuralnet is
  built to train multilayer perceptrons in the context of regression analyses, i.e.
  to approximate functional relationships between covariates and response variables.
  Thus, neural networks are used as extensions of generalized linear models. neuralnet
  is a very flexible package. The backpropagation algorithm and three versions of
  resilient backpropagation are implemented and it provides a custom-choice of activation
  and error function. An arbitrary number of covariates and response variables as
  well as of hidden layers can theoretically be included. The paper gives a brief
  introduction to multi-layer perceptrons and resilient backpropagation and demonstrates
  the application of neuralnet using the data set infert, which is contained in the
  R distribution.
