title: '**FuzzySimRes**: Epistemic Bootstrap -- the Efficient Tool for Statistical
  Inference Based on Imprecise Data'
abstract: |
  The classical Efron's bootstrap is widely used in many areas of
  statistical inference, including imprecise data. In our new package
  [**FuzzySimRes**](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=FuzzySimRes) we
  adapted the bootstrap methodology to the epistemic fuzzy data, i.e.
  fuzzy perceptions of the usual real-valued random variables. The
  epistemic bootstrap algorithms deliver real-valued samples generated
  randomly from the initial fuzzy sample. Then, these samples can be
  utilized directly in various statistical procedures. Moreover, we
  implemented a practically oriented simulation procedure to generate
  synthetic fuzzy samples and provided a real-life epistemic dataset
  ready to use for various techniques of statistical analysis. Some
  examples of their applications, together with the comparisons of the
  epistemic bootstrap algorithms and the respective benchmarks, are also
  discussed.

## Introduction {#intro}

Efron's bootstrap [@EfroTibs93] is a simple but very powerful tool. This
useful resampling method is successfully applied in statistical
inference, including estimation, hypotheses testing, and other data
analysis techniques, e.g.,
[@davison_hinkley_1997; @ISLR; @romaniuk2019].

In our package **FuzzySimRes** we adapted the classical bootstrap
algorithm to a special kind of imprecise data, i.e. the epistemic random
fuzzy numbers (see [@Couso2014]), which might be treated as fuzzy
perceptions of the usual real-valued random variables. This way, a
special resampling methodology, known as the epistemic bootstrap, can be
introduced
[@grzegorzewski2021; @10.1007/978-3-031-08974-9_39; @pgmr2022].
Following the suggested methods we can generate random real-valued
samples based on the initial fuzzy sample. Such a "change of a
viewpoint" from the "fuzzy world" to its "clear" (i.e. real-value)
counterpart can be a very useful and important tool. This allows all
commonly used classical statistical methods (developed for real-valued
samples), including statistical tests, estimation procedures, etc., to
be directly and easily adapted to fuzzy epistemic samples.

Please note that statistical inference for the fuzzy data is usually
underdeveloped, poses some problems, and leads to discussions about the
intuitions, solutions, etc. (e.g., concerning the different approaches
to the p-value).

We provide some useful functions in our package **FuzzySimRes**. They
are related to a practically oriented simulation of various types of
fuzzy numbers (FNs), the epistemic bootstrap itself, and its
applications related to the estimation of important statistical measures
of the initial sample, and the one- and two-sample statistical tests.
Additionally, we provide the real-life dataset of the epistemic FNs,
which can be useful in comparing various approaches to fuzzy statistical
inference. Based on the two general epistemic bootstrap functions, users
of **FuzzySimRes** can build their own "epistemic bootstrap statistical
tools" to fit their purposes (e.g., the necessity of using tests other
than the Kolmogorov-Smirnov one).

In the following, we briefly compare **FuzzySimRes** package with other
existing ones and introduce a necessary notation. Then, the functions
implemented in the package are illustrated with the respective examples.
Finally, the outcomes of these functions are compared taking into
account some benchmarks for different statistical problems using both
the synthetic and real-life data.

### A brief review of related packages

There are some packages related to fuzzy numbers and their statistical
analysis. Firstly, we should mention
[**FuzzyNumbers**](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=FuzzyNumbers)
[@FuzzyNumbersMan]. This library aims to provide S4 classes and methods
for FNs. They can be used to construct different types of FNs (e.g.,
triangular or trapezoidal ones), compute arithmetic operators for fuzzy
values, calculate their approximations, and find different
characteristics of FNs (like the possibility and necessity values,
expected interval, ambiguity, membership functions among many others)
for arbitrary FNs or some of their special types, etc. Notably, our
package **FuzzySimRes** uses S4 objects describing FNs derived from this
package. However, there are no special functions devoted to simulations
or resampling methods in **FuzzyNumbers** package. Therefore, it can be
seen as a kind of "foundation" to deal with FNs.

The next package,
[**FuzzySTs**](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=FuzzySTs)
[@FuzzySTsMan] is a collection of various statistical tools, like
fuzzification methods, numerical estimations of fuzzy statistical
measures and bootstrap distribution of the likelihood ratio, testing
hypotheses by fuzzy confidence intervals and estimation of the fuzzy
p-values for epistemic fuzzy data. These approaches are related to fuzzy
notions, like fuzzy p-values, resulting in the strictly fuzzy output
[@Berkachy2019].

And [**SAFD**](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=SAFD)
[@Trutschnig2013] package joins two kinds of functions. Similarly to
**FuzzyNumbers**, it provides basic operations on FNs (like the sum,
mean, etc.), but it also contains some strictly statistical functions.
They allow us to simulate FNs and perform bootstrap tests for the
equality of the means. As for the simulation function, this is an
implementation of the second procedure described by
[@GONZALEZRODRIGUEZ2009642], where a respective basis is perturbated
stochastically to generate a new polygonal fuzzy number. There are
important theoretical and practical differences [@FRV] between this
approach and the one applied in **FuzzySimRes** package. The statistical
tests in **SAFD** library are exclusively based on the classical
bootstrap as described by [@COLUBI2009344; @Montenegro2004].

On the other hand,
[**Sim.PLFN**](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=Sim.PLFN)
[@SimPLFNMan] can be seen as a kind of "ancestor" of our package. It
allows only to simulation of some kinds of FNs some kinds of FNs,
especially so-called piecewise linear FNs [@COROIANU201326], and
calculates a few basic operators (like the sum, mean, and variance) for
them.

Another package,
[**FuzzyStatTra**](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=FuzzyStatTra)
[@FuzzyStatTraMan], also provides basic statistical functions for FNs
like calculation of the mean and medians, indexes, and various distance
measures. Some simulation procedures are also included there, but they
are intended for special cases of dependent and independent components
described by [@7295579]. Therefore, they can not be considered as
"multi-purpose" generation functions when the probability distributions
are selected by the user.

We should also mention our previous package,
[**FuzzyResampling**](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=FuzzyResampling)
[@FuzzyResampling] that provides various resampling algorithms other
than the classical bootstrap [@fuzzyResamplingArt]. The main aim of
these approaches is to overcome a problem with repetition of a few
distinct values (which is commonly seen in the case of the Efron's
bootstrap) and to create FNs, which are "similar" (in the sense of some
characteristics of FNs) but not "the same" as values from the initial
sample
[@grzegorzewski_amcs2020; @romaniuk_hryniewicz; @GrzegorzewskiRom2021].
Additionally, the tests for the means related to the approach presented
by [@LUBIANO2016918] but based on these new resampling methods are also
provided.

Nevertheless, **FuzzySimRes** has some unique features. Firstly, it adds
very useful simulation functions (as its acronym -- Fuzzy Simulations
and Resampling -- suggests) to complete **FuzzyNumbers** in this field.
These procedures are very intuitive and practically oriented as noted by
[@FRV] (contrary to, e.g., **SAFD** that adds some random noise without
keeping track of important characteristics of the input FNs). Secondly,
the so-called epistemic bootstrap is implemented there. Apart from
ready-to-use general epistemic bootstrap functions, special procedures
are provided for the estimation of parameters of the underlying
statistical model, together with an interface that can be used with
various classical statistical tests. The epistemic bootstrap is a
relatively new idea and the respective algorithms were not implemented
in other publicly available software packages (including R itself). It
should be noted, that this approach is completely different when
compared with the ontic-oriented resampling procedures from
**FuzzyResampling** that can be seen as a "generalization" of the
classical bootstrap procedure
[@grzegorzewski_amcs2020; @GrzegorzewskiRom2021].

### Epistemic fuzzy numbers

In the following, we recall some basic concepts and notations concerning
fuzzy numbers. For a more detailed introduction, we refer the reader to,
e.g., [@ban_coroianu_pg].

A **fuzzy number** (abbreviated further as FN) is an imprecise value
characterized by a mapping $\tilde{A}:\mathbb{R}\to [0,1]$ (a
**membership function**), such that its $\alpha$-cut defined by
$$\tilde{A}_{\alpha}=\begin{cases}
\{x\in\mathbb{R}:\tilde{A}(x)\geqslant\alpha\} & \text{if}\quad \alpha\in (0,1], \\
cl\{x\in\mathbb{R}:\tilde{A}(x)>0\} & \text{if}\quad \alpha=0,
\end{cases} \label{eq_acut}   (\#eq:eq-acut)$$
is a nonempty compact interval for each $\alpha\in [0,1]$. Operator $cl$
in \@ref(eq:eq-acut) denotes the closure. Every FN is completely
characterized both by its membership function $\tilde{A}(x)$ and a
family of $\alpha$-cuts $\{\tilde{A}_{\alpha}\}_{\alpha\in [0,1]}$.
There are two special $\alpha$-cuts: the **core**
$\tilde{A}_1=\mathrm{core}(\tilde{A})$, which contains all values fully
compatible with the concept described by $\tilde{A}$, and the
**support** $\tilde{A}_0=\mathrm{supp}(\tilde{A})$ on real line, for
which values are compatible to some extent with the concept modeled by
$\tilde{A}$. A family of all FNs will be denoted
by¬†$\mathbb{F}(\mathbb{R})$.

There are many possible shapes of the membership functions. A special
family of the **LR-fuzzy numbers** is defined by
$$\tilde{A}(x)=
\begin{cases}
 0 & \text{if}\quad x < a_1,  \\
 L \left( \frac{x-a_1}{a_2 - a_1}\right) & \text{if}\quad a_1 \leqslant x < a_2 ,  \\
 1 & \text{if}\quad a_2 \leqslant x < a_3 , \\
 R \left( \frac{a_4 - x}{a_4 - a_3}\right) & \text{if}\quad a_3 \leqslant x < a_4 , \\
 0 & \text{if}\quad x \geqslant a_4,  
\end{cases}
\label{eq:LFfn}   (\#eq:LFfn)$$
where $L, R: [0,1] \rightarrow [0,1]$ are continuous and strictly
increasing function such that $L(0)=R(0)=0$ and $L(1)=R(1)=1$, and
$a_1,a_2,a_3,a_4\in\mathbb{R}$, where
$a_1\leqslant a_2\leqslant a_3\leqslant a_4$. If $L$ and $R$ are linear
functions, i.e.
$L \left( \frac{x-a_1}{a_2 - a_1}\right) = \frac{x-a_1}{a_2 - a_1}$ and
$R \left( \frac{a_4 - x}{a_4 - a_3}\right) = \frac{a_4 - x}{a_4 - a_3}$,
we get a **trapezoidal fuzzy number** (denoted further on as TPFN).
Moreover, if $a_2=a_3$ then we have a **triangular fuzzy number**
(abbreviated as TRFN). In these two cases, we can simply write
$A=(a_1, a_2, a_3, a_4)$ (for TPFN) or $A = (a_1, a_2, a_4)$ (for TRFN)
to fully describe such FNs.

Another type of the LR-fuzzy number is known as the **$k$-knot piecewise
linear fuzzy number** [@Coroianu2019] (or polygonal fuzzy number, see
[@Baez2012], abbreviated further as PLFN), which is suitable especially
in an approximation of more complex FNs. In this case, $L$ and $R$
functions are polygons consisting of $k\in\mathbb{N}$ segments.

Fuzzy numbers are used to model the results of various experiments that
cannot be precisely described, qualified, or measured. But in many
cases, we have to draw conclusions and make decisions based on data
whose uncertainty comes both from randomness (which classical statistics
copes with) and lack of precision (for which the fuzzy set theory is
perfect for modeling). To model such data one can use **fuzzy random
variables**, known also as **random fuzzy numbers** [@FRV].

It should be noted here that we can look at fuzzy random variables from
two different perspectives: **ontic** or **epistemic** (e.g.
[@Couso2014]). The first concerns data that appear to be essentially
fuzzy in value, while the second refers to situations where, although
precise (accurate) data values exist, they are imprecisely observed
(e.g. due to imperfections in measuring devices, inaccuracies caused by
people performing the measurements, or how results are reported), so
their true actual values remain unknown. This second kind of imprecision
is widespread in real-life problems met in engineering, science, and
other applications, so further on we limit our attention only to
epistemic data.

Following the definition by [@Kwakernaak] and [@Kruse1982] a fuzzy
random variable $\widetilde{X}$ can be considered as a *fuzzy
perception* of the unknown random variable $X$, called the *original* of
$\widetilde{X}$. More precisely, given a probability space
$(\Omega,\mathcal{F},P)$, a mapping $X:\Omega \to\mathbb{F}(\mathbb{R})$
is said to be a fuzzy random variable (f.r.v.) if for each
$\alpha\in [0,1]$ $(\inf X_\alpha):\Omega\to\mathbb{R}$ and
$(\sup X_\alpha):\Omega\to\mathbb{R}$ are real-valued random variables
on $(\Omega,\mathcal{F},P)$. Similarly, a **fuzzy random sample**
$\widetilde{X}_1,\ldots,\widetilde{X}_n$ is a fuzzy perception of a
random sample $X_1,\ldots,X_n$ of the usual real-valued random
variables. For more details, we refer the reader to
[@Kwakernaak; @Kruse1982].

### Epistemic vs classical bootstrap

There are important differences between the classical Efron's bootstrap
[@EfroTibs93] and its epistemic counterpart
[@grzegorzewski2021; @pgmr2022; @PGMR2024AMS]. In the classical
bootstrap approach, the initial sample is then directly resampled.
Therefore, in the case of fuzzy input, the output also consists of the
same FNs as in the primary sample (with possible repetitions or omitting
some of them). This procedure can be very useful in statistical
inference (see, e.g., [@gil; @LUBIANO2016918; @Montenegro2004]) but the
respective statistical tests (or other statistical procedures like the
estimation) have to be specially developed for fuzzy-valued samples.
Therefore, there is a need to construct "almost completely new"
statistical solutions taking into account various distance measures for
fuzzy sets existing in the literature, more complex definitions of the
expected value, possible problems with difference operator, etc.
[@ban_coroianu_pg; @HEILPERN199281]. Resampling procedures existing in
**FuzzyResampling** package can be seen as a kind of generalization of
this classical bootstrap (in the same manner as the smoothed bootstrap
in the case of real-valued samples). They aim to preserve some important
characteristics of FNs (like the value, ambiguity, etc.) but with an
alternation of FNs from the initial sample into "new" values occurring
in the generated samples
[@grzegorzewski_amcs2020; @GrzegorzewskiRom2021]. However, we are still
obtaining fuzzy-valued outputs for these methods.

On the other hand, in the epistemic bootstrap, a completely real-valued
(i.e. "crisp") sample is generated from a fuzzy-valued initial sample.
It allows to use of directly highly developed statistical tools for
real-valued data (various statistical tests, point or interval
estimators, etc.) without the need for transforming them into a "new
fuzzy world". Consequently, knowing statistical tools with suitable good
properties, the areas of possible applications of epistemic fuzzy data
may substantially expand. To explain it better, consider the following
goodness-of-fit testing problem. In [@LUBIANO2016918] and
[@lubiano2017], the outcomes of the well-known questionnaire TIMSS-PIRLS
2011 performed by Spanish primary school pupils were considered, while
in [@Ramos-Guajardo2019] experts' perceptions about different
characteristics of the Gamonedo blue chees were discussed. In both
cases, researchers dealt with subjective valuations expressed in natural
language, which are inherently imprecise, and therefore modeled using
ontic fuzzy sets. Thus, the problems mentioned above required the
construction of appropriate statistical tools that would enable
inferences to be made based on this type of data. Meanwhile, the
epistemic variants of the classical Kolmogorov-Smirnov and Cramer-von
Mises tests were directly used for fuzzy data concerning the lifetimes
of street light equipment [@Hesamian2013] and electronic circuit
thickness [@FARAZ20102684] in [@PGMR2024AMS]. The obtained results were
consistent with predictions concerning these real-life samples, like the
behavior of the probability distributions of their originals
[@Gibbons2010]. The example related to the electronic circuit thickness
is also considered further in this paper. Some other applications can be
also found in
[@10.1007/978-3-031-08974-9_39; @pgmr2022; @GrzegorzewskiRom2021; @PGMR2024AMS].

Moreover, using brute computational force, we can easily improve the
quality of the outputs. However, the results are quite satisfactory also
for the limited number of $\alpha$-cuts. For instance, using even 10
$\alpha$-cuts leads to the p-values for the epistemic versions of the
goodness-of-fit tests (like the Kolmogorov-Smirnov or Cramer-von Mises
tests) very close to their respective benchmarks [@PGMR2024AMS].

## Overview of **FuzzySimRes** package {#overview}

Firstly, we briefly discuss the functions implemented in **FuzzySimRes**
package. They can be roughly divided into four groups:

1.  random generation of FNs of various types,

2.  general epistemic bootstrap procedures,

3.  epistemic estimation of basic population characteristics from fuzzy
    samples,

4.  interface to statistical tests based on the epistemic bootstrap.

Moreover, a set of real-life epistemic fuzzy data is also included in
the package. All examples in R can be reproduced using the supplementary
file.

Taking into account the above-mentioned types of functions, there are
many possible applications of **FuzzySimRes** package:

1.  Generation of synthetic fuzzy samples according to the specified
    probability distributions. Such samples can be then used to check
    the validity and quality of new statistical tools for FNs in a
    strictly controlled "environment", e.g., to plot power curves for a
    statistical test [@pgmr2022] or to check the influence of different
    model parameters on the estimated p-values [@PGMR2024AMS].

2.  Estimation is one of the key problems in statistical inference. The
    same applies to fuzzy-valued data, especially in the epistemic case.
    Then, our considerations about the mean or the standard deviation
    related to the respective originals of the fuzzy random sample can
    give us the necessary insight into the parameters of the underlying
    statistical model [@grzegorzewski2021; @pgmr2022].

3.  Statistical tests are the next important subject in statistical
    inference. To accept or reject the null hypothesis, the respective
    statistical test has to be developed. As it was previously
    mentioned, the epistemic bootstrap allows for direct application of
    the widely known real-valued tests instead of their "fuzzy-oriented"
    counterparts. Therefore, e.g., the classical goodness-of-fit
    Kolmogorov-Smirnov or Cramer-von Mises tests can be directly used
    with the interface provided by **FuzzySimRes** package
    [@10.1007/978-3-031-08974-9_39; @PGMR2024AMS].

4.  Real-life fuzzy data are also important to develop statistical
    procedures. Synthetic samples are very useful, but some problems are
    only visible when the data are provided by a "true source". In
    **FuzzySimRes** package, there is a special set of such data used to
    construct a fuzzy statistical control chart [@FARAZ20102684] and
    check the quality of statistical tests based on the epistemic
    bootstrap [@PGMR2024AMS].

The general workflow for some possible applications (black lines) and
the internal order of invoking functions (orange lines) from
**FuzzySimRes** package can be found in Fig. \@ref(fig:figflowchart1).

```{r figflowchart1, echo=FALSE , fig.cap="General workflow for possible applications and invoking the functions from FuzzySimRes package.", fig.alt="graphic without alt text", fig.show='hold', fig.align="center", out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics(c("flowchart3.png"))
```

### Generation of the initial sample {#genofinsa}

In many cases, synthetic samples of predefined properties are necessary
to analyze statistical methods numerically. Two functions in
**FuzzySimRes** allow the generation of random fuzzy variables. The
first one

``` r
SimulateFuzzyNumber(originalPD,parOriginalPD,incrCorePD,
  parIncrCorePD,suppLeftPD,parSuppLeftPD,
  suppRightPD,parSuppRightPD,knotNumbers = 0,
  type = "trapezoidal",...)
```

is used to generate randomly a single TPFN (for `type = "trapezoidal"`),
TRFN (`type = "triangular"`), or PLFN (`type = "PLFN"`, respectively).
All these types of FNs utilize the respective S4 objects from
**FuzzyNumbers**.

To simulate a TPFN $\widetilde{X}$, five independent real-valued random
variables are necessary: $X$ for its "true value" (i.e., its
*original*), $C^l, C^r$ -- the left and right increment of the core,
$S^l$, $S^r$ -- the left and right increment of the support,
respectively. To generate these random variables the functions derived
from **stats** [@RMan] with the respective parameters are used (see
Table [1](#tab500)), e.g., to draw randomly the original $X$, the
function `originalPD` with the parameters `parOriginalPD` should be
applied.

::: {#tab500}
  ----------------------------------------------------
  Random variable      Function         Parameters
  ----------------- --------------- ------------------
  $X$                `originalPD`    `parOriginalPD`

  $C^l, C^r$         `incrCorePD`    `parIncrCorePD`

  $S^l$              `suppLeftPD`    `parSuppLeftPD`

  $S^r$              `suppRightPD`   `parSuppRightPD`
  ----------------------------------------------------

  : Table 1: Random variables used to simulate a TPFN.
:::

As a result we obtain a random TPFN given by
$(X-C^l-S^l,X-C^l,X+C^r,X+C^r+S^r)$ (see also
[@10.1007/978-3-031-08974-9_39] for the similar procedure). Obviously,
for a TRFN we have $C^l=C^r=0$ without using the respective parameters
in `SimulateFuzzyNumber`. In the case of a PLFN, the number of knots
`knotNumbers` should be greater than zero, and then the specially
truncated probability distributions for both arms of the support are
applied. The function `SimulateFuzzyNumber` returns both the generated
FN (as `value` in the output list) and its random original $X$ (as
`original`).

Let us initialize a random seed and generate a TPFN with the "true
origin" described by the normal distribution with the expected value
$\mu =0$ and standard deviation $\sigma=1$ (denoted by
$N (\mu, \sigma)$), the increments of the core given by the uniform
distribution on the interval $(0,0.6)$ (denoted by $U(0,0.6)$) and the
increments of the support from $U(0,1)$:

``` r
# seed PRNG
> set.seed(123456)

> SimulateFuzzyNumber(originalPD="rnorm",parOriginalPD=list(mean=0,sd=1),
+  incrCorePD="runif",parIncrCorePD=list(min=0,max=0.6),
+  suppLeftPD="runif",parSuppLeftPD=list(min=0,max=1),
+  suppRightPD="runif",parSuppRightPD=list(min=0,max=1),
+  type="trapezoidal")

$original
[1] 0.6857515

$value
Trapezoidal fuzzy number with:
   support=[-0.316967,1.10087],
      core=[0.480817,0.902528].
```

The second function generates a sample of `n` independent FNs similarly
to `SimulateFuzzyNumber`:

``` r
SimulateSample(n = 1,originalPD,parOriginalPD,incrCorePD,
  parIncrCorePD,suppLeftPD,parSuppLeftPD,
  suppRightPD,parSuppRightPD,knotNumbers = 0,
  type = "trapezoidal")
```

This function returns a list of simulated FNs together with a vector of
their respective originals. Let us generate 10 TPFNs given by the same
distributions as in the previous example and print the second simulated
value and its "true origin":

``` r
# seed PRNG
> set.seed(123456)

> sample1 <- SimulateSample(n=10,originalPD="rnorm",
+  parOriginalPD=list(mean=0,sd=1),
+  incrCorePD="runif",parIncrCorePD=list(min=0,max=0.6),
+  suppLeftPD="runif",parSuppLeftPD=list(min=0,max=1),
+  suppRightPD="runif",parSuppRightPD=list(min=0,max=1),
+  type="trapezoidal")

> sample1$original[2]

[1] -1.301602

> sample1$value[2]

$X2
Trapezoidal fuzzy number with:
   support=[-1.937,-0.229014],
      core=[-1.40214,-0.822808].
      
> plot(sample1$value[[2]])
```

The obtained graph of this exemplary FN can be found in Fig.
\@ref(fig:figFN1).

```{r figFN1, echo=FALSE , fig.cap="Example of the generated TPFN.", fig.alt="graphic without alt text", fig.show='hold', fig.align="center", out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics(c("fuzzy_number_rys1.png"))
```

### Epistemic bootstrap

All of the functions described in further sections use two main
procedures related to the epistemic bootstrap
[@grzegorzewski2021; @10.1007/978-3-031-08974-9_39; @pgmr2022; @PGMR2024AMS].

The first one

``` r
EpistemicBootstrap(fuzzySample, cutsNumber = 1,...)
```

applies the **standard epistemic bootstrap** (abbreviated as *std*) to a
single value or a whole list of FNs given by `fuzzySample`. This
procedure firstly generates uniformly a list of $\alpha$-cuts (their
number is specified by `cutsNumber`). Then, it generates a sample from
each of the input FNs, corresponding to the aforementioned list of the
$\alpha$-cuts. A final output is given as a real-valued matrix, with the
number of rows that is equal to `cutsNumber`, and the number of columns
designated by the initial sample size. This way, we obtain $b$
real-valued bootstrap samples
$\mathbb{X}^{*j} = \left ( X_1^{*j}, \ldots,  X_n^{*j} \right )$, based
on the initial fuzzy sample
$\tilde{\mathbb{X}} = ( \tilde{X}_1, \ldots,  \tilde{X}_n)$, where
$j=1, \ldots,b$ and $b$ is equal to `cutsNumber`.

Let us apply the epistemic bootstrap with 3 $\alpha$-cuts for the
previously generated `sample1`, and then show the output rounded to 4
decimal places:

``` r
> set.seed(123456)

> epistemicOutput <- EpistemicBootstrap(sample1$value, cutsNumber = 3)

> round(epistemicOutput,digits = 4)

           X1      X2     X3     X4      X5     X6     X7      X8      X9    X10
0.7978 0.5323 -1.0784 0.6744 0.8553  0.9501 1.1755 0.6460 -0.5347 -0.0049 1.5937
0.7536 0.5253 -1.4512 1.4851 0.8546  0.9337 1.4773 0.6576 -0.3149 -0.0022 1.8909
0.3913 0.1991 -0.4767 1.1215 0.9443 -0.0089 0.8814 0.4538  0.0633 -0.9345 1.1242
```

The first column shows $\alpha$-cuts drawn randomly, while the rest
columns contain values generated from each $\alpha$-cut.

The second function

``` r
AntitheticBootstrap(fuzzySample, cutsNumber = 1,...)
```

applies the so-called **antithetic epistemic bootstrap** (denoted
further on by *anti*). Instead of drawing a single value from the given
$\alpha$-cut of each FN, we generate two values: one from this
$\alpha$-cut and the other from $(1-\alpha)$-cut, and then we determine
their average. As indicated in
[@10.1007/978-3-031-08974-9_39; @pgmr2022], the antithetic approach
improves the quality of some statistical inference methods. An example
of how to use this function can be found in the supplementary file.

The epistemic bootstrap produces a real-valued sample based on the
initial fuzzy values. Therefore, it can be easily applied to estimate
various statistical measures of the input values (like the mean) or to
conduct many "classical" (i.e. real-valued) statistical tests.

### Estimation of parameters

Estimation of basic population parameters (like the mean) is a
fundamental task of most statistical inference problems. Given fuzzy
data, we can easily adapt the epistemic bootstrap to estimate the
quantities of interest (see [@pgmr2022]).

A general function

``` r
EpistemicEstimator(fuzzySample,estimator = "sd",cutsNumber = 1,bootstrapMethod = "std",
  trueValue = NA,...)
```

can be used to determine the desired estimate from the `fuzzySample` of
the specified function in `estimator`. Both the classical epistemic
approach (`bootstrapMethod = "std"`) and its antithetic counterpart
(`bootstrapMethod = "anti"`) are available. Since the mean is the most
used statistical parameter, it can be obtained using a special function

``` r
EpistemicMean(fuzzySample,cutsNumber = 1,bootstrapMethod = "std",trueValue = NA,...)
```

instead of the general command.

Besides estimates, the standard error (SE) and the mean squared error
(MSE) of the considered estimators are also calculated. The SE is
estimated (for $b >1$) using the formula
$$\label{frachetse}
	\widehat{\mathrm{SE}}=\sqrt{\frac{1}{b-1} \sum_{k=1}^{b} \left ( \hat{\theta} \left (\mathbb{X}^{*k} \right) - \bar{\hat{\theta}} \right )^2}  ,   (\#eq:frachetse)$$
where $\hat{\theta} \left (\mathbb{X}^{*k} \right)$ is the estimator of
$\theta$ based on the epistemic bootstrap sample for the $k$-th
$\alpha$-cut, and $\bar{\hat{\theta}}$ is the overall mean for
$\hat{\theta} \left (\mathbb{X}^{*1} \right),\ldots,\hat{\theta} \left (\mathbb{X}^{*b} \right)$.
If the true (but usually unknown) value of $\theta$ is set with
`trueValue`, then the MSE is estimated by
$$\label{frachetmse}
	\widehat{\mathrm{MSE}}=\frac{1}{b} \sum_{k=1}^{b} \left ( \hat{\theta} \left (\mathbb{X}^{*k} \right) - \theta \right )^2 .   (\#eq:frachetmse)$$

Let us estimate the median and its SE for `sample1` using 100
$\alpha$-cuts and the classical epistemic bootstrap:

``` r
> set.seed(56789)

> EpistemicEstimator(sample1$value, estimator = "median",cutsNumber = 100)

$value
[1] 0.6287525

$SE
[1] 0.1705336

$MSE
[1] NA
```

To estimate the variance using bootstrap, instead of the classical
well-known formula, its more sophisticated and specially corrected
variant [@pgmr2022] can be used with the function

``` r
EpistemicCorrectedVariance(fuzzySample,cutsNumber = 1,bootstrapMethod = "std",...)
```

As noted in [@pgmr2022], this estimator can more closely approximate the
desired value, e.g., we have

``` r
> set.seed(56789)

> EpistemicCorrectedVariance(sample1$value, cutsNumber = 100$)

[1] 0.8729738
```

### Statistical tests

The real-valued samples generated by the epistemic bootstrap can be also
used for hypothesis testing. However, given several bootstrap samples,
one has to clarify how to merge the obtained test statistics or the
p-values [@10.1007/978-3-031-08974-9_39]. **FuzzySimRes** contains a
general function

``` r
EpistemicTest(sample1, sample2, algorithm = "avs", ...)
```

that can be used to activate one of the specially tailored procedures.

By setting `algorithm = "avs"` the **averaging statistic** (abbreviated
as *avs*) is activated and the function

``` r
AverageStatisticEpistemicTest(sample1,sample2,bootstrapMethod = "std",
  test = "ks.test",cutsNumber = 1,criticalValueFunction = "KSTestCriticalValue",...)
```

is used. Similarly, by setting `algorithm = "ms"` the function

``` r
MultiStatisticEpistemicTest(sample1,sample2,bootstrapMethod = "std",
  test = "ks.test",cutsNumber = 1,combineMethod = "simes",...)
```

and **multi-statistic** method (denoted by *ms*) are applied. Finally,
for `algorithm = "res"` the **resampling** algorithm (abbreviated as
*res*) together with the function

``` r
ResamplingStatisticEpistemicTest(sample1,sample2,bootstrapMethod = "std",
  test = "ks.test",cutsNumber = 1,K = 1,combineMethod = "simes",...)
```

run. The above functions can be applied to both one-sample and
two-sample statistical tests, where the relevant samples are entered as
lists of fuzzy values. For the one-sample case, `sample2=NULL` should be
set.

To use a statistical test, one has to specify the name of the respective
function in `test` (e.g., `test="ks.test"` for `ks.test` from **stats**
activates the Kolmogorov-Smirnov goodness-of-fit test, abbreviated
further on as the KS test). User-defined functions can be also used if
they have at least one or two parameters (`x` for one- or `x,y` for
two-sample case, namely) and return a list of at least two values
(`statistic` for the output test statistic, and `p.value` for the
calculated p-value). In the case of the *avs* approach, the additional
parameter `criticalValueFunction` is required with the name of the
function calculating the p-value for a specified critical level of the
considered test statistic. For the KS test, such a procedure is given by
`KSTestCriticalValue` available in **FuzzySimRes**.

To conduct the test, the classical epistemic approach
(`bootstrapMethod = "std"`) or its antithetic version
(`bootstrapMethod = "anti"`) can be applied. The p-values (in the case
of *ms* or *res* methods) are aggregated with the algorithm specified in
`combineMethod`. Besides `combineMethod="mean"`, i.e. the simple
averaging of p-values, all other methods are as in the package
[**palasso**](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=palasso) [@palassoArt].

Let us generate the second sample with the small shift in location and
compare it with the previously generated `sample1` using the two-sample
KS test with the *anti* and *ms* approaches for 100 $\alpha$-cuts:

``` r
> set.seed(56789)

> sample2 <- SimulateSample(n=10,originalPD="rnorm",
+  parOriginalPD=list(mean=0.5,sd=1),
+  incrCorePD="runif",parIncrCorePD=list(min=0,max=0.6),
+  suppLeftPD="runif",parSuppLeftPD=list(min=0,max=1),
+  suppRightPD="runif", parSuppRightPD=list(min=0,max=1),
+  type="trapezoidal")

> EpistemicTest(sample1$value,sample2$value,algorithm = "ms",
+  bootstrapMethod="anti",cutsNumber=100)

[1] 0.1873127
```

An example of the one-sample KS test can be found in the supplementary
file.

### Real-life dataset

**FuzzySimRes** provides a fuzzy epistemic dataset `controlChartData`
concerning electronic circuit thickness, which is one of the most
important quality characteristics in the production of the electronic
boards for vacuum cleaners (see [@FARAZ20102684] for the relevant
source). This dataset is given as a list of 90 TRFNs and contains 30
samples, each of size three. Every observation has its own label
`X.y.z`, where `y` is a sample number, and `z` stands for the element
number in a sample, e.g.

``` r
> controlChartData$X.1.2$

Trapezoidal fuzzy number with:
   support=[70.19,74.15],
      core=[71.4,71.4].
```

is the second value in the first sample.

## Statistical applications with the package

As it was mentioned, the epistemic bootstrap provides real-valued
samples generated from the initial fuzzy sample. It enables us to apply
many classical statistical methods instead of using procedures
specifically designed for fuzzy data (usually underdeveloped in the R
environment). In the following, we present some statistical applications
of such approaches for both synthetic and real-life datasets.

In the first case, using `SimulateSample`, the respective samples are
generated from the probability distributions described in Table
[2](#tab100). Available TPFNs are grouped by their types, wherein the
normal distribution with the mean $\mu$ and standard deviation $\sigma$
is denoted by $\mathrm{N}(\mu,\sigma)$, the uniform distribution on the
interval $(a,b)$ -- by $\mathrm{U}(a,b)$, the exponential distribution
with the parameter $\lambda$ -- by $\mathrm{Exp}(\lambda)$, the Weibull
distribution with the shape $k$ and scale $\lambda$ parameters -- by
$\mathrm{Weib} (k,\lambda)$, and the Gamma distribution with the shape
$\alpha$ and rate $\beta$ parameters -- by $\Gamma (\alpha,\beta)$,
respectively. In the case of the real-life dataset, the data
`controlChartData` embedded in **FuzzySimRes** is applied.

In the following, only some of the results are presented in the tables
and graphs to reduce the overall length of the paper. All of the outputs
can be found in the supplementary script file.

### Comparison of estimators

We start with a comparison of some estimators of the mean, variance, and
median for both epistemic approaches, i.e., the *std* and *anti*. For
all types of the TPFNs mentioned in Table [2](#tab100), the function
`EpistemicEstimator` was applied with $b=100$ $\alpha$-cuts. To limit
the randomness impact, each numerical experiment was repeated $m=1000$
times. Both small ($n=10$) and moderate ($n=100$) samples were
considered.

Since the function `SimulateSample` produces also the "true values" of
the fuzzy samples (i.e., their originals), it gives an opportunity
(quite exceptional in real-life applications) to compare the epistemic
bootstrap estimators based on fuzzy samples with the results related to
these originals. Then, we can calculate the respective error --
**Originals Absolute Error** (abbreviated as OAE) -- that measures the
absolute difference between the epistemic bootstrap estimator
$\hat{\theta}^*_{j}$ based on the $j$-th synthetic sample and its
counterpart $\hat{\theta}^o_{j}$ obtained from the originals for this
$j$-th sample, i.e.,
$$\text{OAE} = \frac{1}{m}\sum_{j=1}^{m} \left | \hat{\theta}^*_{j} - \hat{\theta}^o_{j} \right | ,$$
where $m$ is the number of simulations.

In general, it seems that the *anti* approach gives better results --
the resulting estimates are closer to their "true" values and the
respective errors are lower (see Table [3](#tab200) and the
supplementary file). To facilitate the understanding of Table
[3](#tab200), the best outputs (i.e., the estimators that are the
closest to the respective true values of the parameters, and the lowest
errors in each case) are given in boldface there. Of course, the answers
may vary for the different error measures (e.g., sometimes the OAE is
slightly lower for the *std* approach). However, the *anti* method
clearly provides the significant improvement measured with the SE,
slightly less important (but still visible) in the case of the MSE.
Taking into account the low additional numerical burden of this approach
when it is compared with the *std* method (i.e. generation of two
values: from the $\alpha$-cut and its $(1-\alpha)$ counterpart instead
of only a single drawing), the *anti* algorithm should be recommended to
users. The above-mentioned conclusions are similar to the ones discussed
in [@grzegorzewski2021; @pgmr2022].

### Detection of the difference in location

Then, we conducted the power analysis for the two-sample KS test taking
into account all the considered epistemic bootstrap approaches. Two
independent samples corresponding to the types of the TPFNs from Table
[2](#tab100) were generated and the deterministic shift was added to the
second sample. As previously, both the small ($n=10$) and moderate
($n=100$) samples were considered, and each numerical experiment was
repeated $m=1000$ times. Besides the estimation of the null hypothesis
rejection percentage for the significance level $\alpha =0.05$, the
p-values for the increasing shift were also obtained and aggregated by
simple averaging.

Using `SimulateSample` which delivers the originals of the simulated
fuzzy sample, we can compare the results of the epistemic bootstrap
tests with their "crisp" counterpart, so the results of the classical
two-sample KS test serve us as a benchmark. We can see that the
estimated p-values (see Fig.¬†[[figN100pvalue1]](#figN100pvalue1)) and
power curves (see Fig. [[figN100power1]](#figN100power1)) for the
moderate sample of TPFNs described by $\mathbb{F}_{(\mathrm{N,U,U,U})}$
are very close to their respective benchmarks, especially for the shift
larger than 0.75. To visualize the results better, the differences in
p-values and power curves between the epistemic bootstrap approaches and
the classical KS test were also calculated (see Fig.
\@ref(fig:figN100pvalue2) and \@ref(fig:figN100power2), respectively).

```{r figN100pvalue2, echo=FALSE , fig.cap="Differences in estimated p-values between the two-sample epistemic and ‚Äúcrisp‚Äù KS tests for $\\mathbb{F}_{(\\mathrm{N,U,U,U})}$, n=100, and shift in location.", fig.alt="graphic without alt text", fig.show='hold', fig.align="center", out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics(c("pvalue_N100_rys01.png","diff_pvalue_N100_rys01.png"))
```

```{r figN100power2, echo=FALSE , fig.cap="Differences in power curves between the two-sample epistemic and ‚Äúcrisp‚Äù KS tests for $\\mathbb{F}_{(\\mathrm{N,U,U,U})}$, n=100, and shift in location.", fig.alt="graphic without alt text", fig.show='hold', fig.align="center", out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics(c("power_N100_rys01.png","diff_power_N100_rys01.png"))
```

In general, the estimation error for p-values is lower when the *ms* or
*res* approaches are used (especially when they are combined with the
*anti* method), and the power curves are closer to the respective
benchmarks for the *avs* and *ms* algorithms (the *anti* method has also
a beneficial effect). Additional examples can be found in the
supplementary file and [@10.1007/978-3-031-08974-9_39].

### Detection of the difference in scale

Next, we conducted the power study of tests to detect the difference in
dispersion. This case was modeled by gradually increasing the standard
deviation of the second sample when the first one is simulated according
to $\mathbb{F}_{(\mathrm{N,U,U,U})}$ type.

As previously, the p-values and power curves (see Fig.
[[figN100pvaluesd1]](#figN100pvaluesd1) and
[[figN100powersd1]](#figN100powersd1)) were estimated for the moderate
sample and the respective simulation parameters: $m=1000$,
$\alpha=0.05$, and $b=100$. A comparison of the epistemic bootstrap
approaches and our benchmark (i.e., the two-sample "crisp" KS test) was
also done (see Fig. \@ref(fig:figN100pvaluesd2) and
\@ref(fig:figN100powersd2), respectively). It seems that the estimation
error of p-values is lower for the *ms* or *res* approach and the power
curves are closer to the respective results of the "crisp" KS test for
the *avs* and *ms* algorithms. Thus, the *anti* method again improves
the results.

An additional example for the small sample is provided in the
supplementary file.

knitr::include_graphics(c("pvalue_sd_N100_rys01.png","diff_pvalue_sd_N100_rys01.png"))
```

```

### Goodness-of-fit test in quality control

Finally, we applied the KS two-sample test for the manufacturing data
embedded in **FuzzySimRes**. These fuzzy data can be used to build the
respective control charts to check the behavior of the underlying
process [@FARAZ20102684]. But in our experiment, the sample was divided
randomly into two parts to check if they came from the same distribution
(so they were "not statistically different").

``` r
> set.seed(5678)
> randomSetsCCD <- sample(length(controlChartData),length(controlChartData)/2)

> EpistemicTest(controlChartData[randomSetsCCD],controlChartData[-randomSetsCCD],
+  algorithm="avs",cutsNumber=1000)

[1] 0.3319477

> EpistemicTest(controlChartData[randomSetsCCD],controlChartData[-randomSetsCCD],
+  algorithm="ms",combineMethod="mean",cutsNumber=1000)

[1] 0.433548

> EpistemicTest(controlChartData[randomSetsCCD],controlChartData[-randomSetsCCD],
+  algorithm="res",combineMethod="mean",cutsNumber=1000,K=200)

[1] 0.4616578
```

As we can see, all of the considered algorithms do not reject the null
hypothesis for the KS test, even for high significance levels. These
results are consistent with the findings in [@FARAZ20102684]. Moreover,
as [@PGMR2024AMS] described, the epistemic KS test clearly indicates the
issues caused by the troublesome 21st subsample. It makes the process
out of control and results in the lower p-values in the goodness-of-fit
tests.

## Conclusions

**FuzzyResampling** package delivers resampling methods developed to
overcome some shortcomings of the classical Efron's bootstrap in the
fuzzy environment (see also [@fuzzyResamplingArt]). However, this
package was intended for the ontic fuzzy data.

Meanwhile, **FuzzySimRes** is a package that has a completely new
purpose. The proposed epistemic bootstrap methods allow the generation
of real-valued samples from the epistemic fuzzy data, which can then be
directly utilized as input values for the various classical statistical
procedures (like estimators, tests, etc.). It seems that the proposed
methods combined with some well-known statistical techniques can be
competitive with available fuzzy procedures which are not too popular
among practitioners. Moreover, as was shown in the respective examples,
the results of the suggested approaches implemented to imprecise data
are comparable with their counterparts -- the benchmarks related to the
real-valued originals of the fuzzy perceptions.

Of course, further investigations on epistemic bootstrap are still
required. They can be aimed both at new resampling epistemic procedures
and their applications in statistical inference and machine learning.
