title: 'BNSP: an R Package for Fitting Bayesian Semiparametric Regression Models and
  Variable Selection'
abstract: The R package BNSP provides a unified framework for semiparametric location-scale
  regression and stochastic search variable selection. The statistical methodology
  that the package is built upon utilizes basis function expansions to represent semiparametric
  covariate effects in the mean and variance functions, and spike-slab priors to perform
  selection and regularization of the estimated effects. In addition to the main function
  that performs posterior sampling, the package includes functions for assessing convergence
  of the sampler, summarizing model fits, visualizing covariate effects and obtaining
  predictions for new responses or their means given feature/covariate vectors.
