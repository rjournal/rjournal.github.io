title: 'GMDH: An R Package for Short Term Forecasting via GMDH-Type Neural Network
  Algorithms'
abstract: Group Method of Data Handling (GMDH)-type neural network algorithms are
  the heuristic self organization method for the modelling of complex systems. GMDH
  algorithms are utilized for a variety of purposes, examples include identification
  of physical laws, the extrapolation of physical fields, pattern recognition, clustering,
  the approximation of multidimensional processes, forecasting without models, etc.
  In this study, the R package GMDH is presented to make short term forecasting through
  GMDH-type neural network algorithms. The GMDH package has options to use different
  transfer functions (sigmoid, radial basis, polynomial, and tangent functions) simultaneously
  or separately. Data on cancer death rate of Pennsylvania from 1930 to 2000 are used
  to illustrate the features of the GMDH package. The results based on ARIMA models
  and exponential smoothing methods are included for comparison.
