title: Spatial Uncertainty Propagation Analysis with the spup R Package
abstract: Many environmental and geographical models, such as those used in land degradation,
  agro ecological and climate studies, make use of spatially distributed inputs that
  are known imperfectly. The R package spup provides functions for examining the uncertainty
  propagation from input data and model parameters onto model outputs via the environmental
  model. The functions include uncertainty model specification, stochastic simulation
  and propagation of uncertainty using Monte Carlo (MC) techniques. Uncertain variables
  are described by probability distributions. Both numerical and categorical data
  types are handled. The package also accommodates spatial auto-correlation within
  a variable and cross-correlation between variables. The MC realizations may be used
  as input to the environmental models written in or called from R. This article provides
  theoretical background and three worked examples that guide users through the application
  of spup.
