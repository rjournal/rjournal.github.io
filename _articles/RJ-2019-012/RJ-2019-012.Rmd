title: 'Whats for dynr: A Package for Linear and Nonlinear Dynamic Modeling in R'
abstract: Intensive longitudinal data in the behavioral sciences are often noisy,
  multivariate in nature, and may involve multiple units undergoing regime switches
  by showing discontinuities interspersed with continuous dynamics. Despite increasing
  interest in using linear and nonlinear differential/difference equation models with
  regime switches, there has been a scarcity of software packages that are fast and
  freely accessible. We have created an R package called dynr that can handle a broad
  class of linear and nonlinear discreteand continuous-time models, with regime-switching
  properties and linear Gaussian measurement functions, in C, while maintaining simple
  and easy-to learn model specification functions in R. We present the mathematical
  and computational bases used by the dynr R package, and present two illustrative
  examples to demonstrate the unique features of dynr.
