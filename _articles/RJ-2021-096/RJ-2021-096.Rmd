title: 'msae: An R Package of Multivariate Fay-Herriot Models for Small Area Estimation'
abstract: The paper introduces an R Package of multivariate Fay-Herriot models for
  small area estimation named *msae*. This package implements four types of Fay-Herriot
  models, including univariate Fay-Herriot model (model 0), multivariate Fay-Herriot
  model (model 1), autoregressive multivariate Fay-Herriot model (model 2), and heteroskedastic
  autoregressive multivariate Fay-Herriot model (model 3). It also contains some datasets
  generated based on multivariate Fay-Herriot models. We describe and implement functions
  through various practical examples. Multivariate Fay-Herriot models produce a more
  efficient parameter estimation than direct estimation and univariate model.

# Introduction

Survey sampling is a data collection method by observing several units
of observation to obtain information from the entire population.
Compared to other data collection methods, survey sampling has
advantages in cost, time, and human resources. Survey sampling is
designed for a certain size of the domain, commonly a large area.
However, data demand for small areas is increasing and has become high
issue [@ghosh:1994]. The inadequate sample size causes a large standard
error of parameter estimates. This problem is overcome by indirect
estimation, namely Small Area Estimation (SAE).

@rao:2015 said that SAE increases the effectiveness of sample size using
the strength of neighboring areas and information on other variables
that are related to the variable of interest. There are some estimation
methods in SAE, namely Best Linear Unbiased Predictors (BLUP), Empirical
Best Linear Unbiased Predictors (EBLUP), Hierarchical Bayes (HB), and
Empirical Bayes (EB). The most common SAE estimator is the EBLUP
[@krieg:2015]. EBLUP has advantages over EB and HB methods. It is a
development of the BLUP method that minimizes the MSE among other
unbiased linear estimators [@ghosh:1994]. Area level of EBLUP
application for the continuous response variable, called Fay-Herriot
model, was firstly employed for estimating log per-capita income (PCI)
in small places in the US [@rao:2015].

The Fay-Herriot model has extended into a multivariate Fay-Herriot
model, which is a model with several correlated response variables.
@datta:1991 firstly applied the multivariate model to estimate the
median income of four-person families in the US states. @benavent:2015
developed multivariate Fay-Herriot models with the EBLUP method and
introduced four estimation models based on the estimated variance matrix
structure. @azka:2019 also implemented the multivariate Fay-Herriot
model and indicated that the multivariate Fay-Herriot model produces a
more efficient parameter estimation than the univariate model.

On the Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN), there are several
packages implementing small area estimation. Some of them are included
in the Small Area Estimation subsection of The CRAN Task View: Official
Statistics & Survey Methodology [@taskview], including
[*sae*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=sae) [@sae],
[*rsae*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=rsae) [@rsae],
[*nlme*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=nlme) [@nlme],
[*hbsae*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=hbsae) [@hbsae],
[*JoSAE*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=JoSAE) [@JoSAE], and
[*BayesSAE*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=BayesSAE) [@BayesSAE].
Other popular SAE packages not included in that subsection are
[*mme*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=mme) [@mme] and
[*saery*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=saery) [@saery].

In this paper, we introduce our R package of multivariate Fay-Herriot
models for small area estimation, named
[*msae*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=msae). This package and its
details are available on CRAN at
<http://CRAN.R-project.org/package=msae>. Functions in this package
implement four Fay-Herriot Models, namely Model 0, Model 1, Model 2, and
Model 3, as proposed by @benavent:2015.

The paper is structured as follows. First, we explain multivariate
Fay-Herriot models in Section [2](#mfh). Then, we describe *msae*
package and illustrate the use of this package for SAE estimation by
employing simulation studies and applying it to a real dataset in the
next Sections [3](#overview) and [4](#example). Finally, we provide a
conclusion in Section [8](#conclusion).

# Multivariate Fay-Herriot model {#mfh}

The multivariate Fay-Herriot model is an extension of the Fay-Herriot
model, which utilizes some correlated responses. Fay-Herriot is a
combination of two model components. The first component is called the
sampling model, and the second component is called the linking model.

Suppose we want to estimate characteristics of R variables in D areas,
$\mu_{d} = (\mu_{1d}, \dotsc ,\mu_{Rd})^T$, with $d = 1, \dotsc ,D$. Let
$y_d= (y_{1d}, \dotsc ,y_{Rd})^T$, be a direct estimator of $\mu_d$. The
first component, i.e., sampling model is
$$y_d=\mu_d+e_d, \quad  e_d \sim N(0,V_{e_d}), \quad  d=1,\dotsc,D$$
, where $e_d$ is sampling error with a covariance matrix, $V_{e_d}$ ,
that is assumed to be known. In the second component, we assume that
$\mu_d$ is linearly related with $p_d$ area-specific auxiliary variables
$X_d= (X_1,\dotsc,X_{p_d})^T$ as follows:
$$\mu_d=X_d \beta_d + u_d, \quad u_d \sim N(0,V_{u_d}), \quad d=1,\dotsc,D$$
, where $u_d$ is area random effects, and $\beta_d$ is a vector of
regression coefficient corresponding with $X_d$. This second component
is called the linking model. The combination of the two components forms
a multivariate linear mixed model as follows:
$$y_d=X_d\beta_d + u_d + e_d,\quad e_d \sim N(0,V_{e_d}),\quad d=1,\dotsc,D$$
, where $u$ and $e$ are independent.

@benavent:2015 proposed Fay-Herriot models using four different variance
matrices, Model 0, Model 1, Model 2, and Model 3. Model 0 is a
univariate Fay-Herriot Model, of which the sampling error and the random
effect of target variables are independent. Sampling error and random
effect variance matrix are written as follows:
$$V_{ud} = diag_{a \leq r \leq R}(\sigma_{ur}^2)$$

$$V_{ed} = diag_{a \leq r \leq R}(\sigma_{edr}^2)$$
,
$$\text{where}  \: d=1,\dotsc,D$$
.

Model 1, Model 2, and Model 3 are multivariate Fay-Herriot models, of
which the variance matrices are no longer diagonal matrices. Model 1 is
a multivariate form of Model 0, where the random effect variance of
Model 1 is still a diagonal matrix. Model 2 is called the autoregressive
multivariate Fay-Herriot model (AR(1)), in which the random variance
matrix is written as follows :
$$V_{ud} = \sigma_{ur}^2 \Omega_d (\rho)$$

$$\Omega_d (\rho) = \frac{1}{1- \rho^2}  \begin{bmatrix}
                    1 & \rho & \cdots & \rho^{R-1}\\
                    \rho & 1 &  & \rho^{R-2}\\
                    \vdots &  & \ddots & \vdots \\
                    \rho^{R-1} & \rho^{R-2} & \cdots & 1
                    \end{bmatrix}$$
Model 3 is called heteroskedastic autoregressive multivariate
Fay-Herriot model (HAR(1)), which the element of random error is written
as follows:

$$u_{dr} = \rho u_{dr-1} + a_{dr}$$

$$u_{d0} \sim N(0, \sigma_{u0}^2) \quad \text{and} \quad  a_{dr} \sim N(0, \sigma_{r}^2)$$
, where $\sigma_{u0}^2=1 , a_{dr}, \text{ and } u_{d0}$ are independent.
The element of random variance matrix is written as follow:
$$\sigma_{drii} = \sum_{k=1}^{i} \rho^{2k} \sigma_{i-k}^2$$

$$\sigma_{drij} = \sum_{k=0}^{|i-j|} \rho^{2k+|i-j|} \sigma_{|i-j|-k}^2$$
.

## BLUP and EBLUP

The best linear unbiased prediction (BLUP) of $\mu$ is
$$\hat{\mu} = X \hat{\beta} + Z^T \hat{V_u} Z \Omega^{-1} (y-X \hat{\beta)}$$
, where $\hat{\beta} = (X^T \Omega^{-1} X)^{-1} X^T \Omega^{-1} y$ is
the best linear unbiased estimator (BLUE) of $\beta$ with the covariance
matrix $cov(\hat{\beta})=(X^T \Omega^{-1} X)^{-1}$. BLUP estimator
depends on the random effect variance that is usually unknown. Using
Restricted Maximum Likelihood (REML), we estimate and substitute random
effect variance estimator for obtaining the multivariate EBLUB
estimator. The estimation formula with EBLUP is written as follows:
$$\hat{\mu} = X \hat{\beta} + Z^T \hat{V_u} Z \hat{\Omega}^{-1}  (y-X\hat{\beta})$$

$$\hat{\Omega} = Z^T \hat{V_u} Z+ V_e$$
, where
$\hat{\beta}=(X^T \hat{\Omega}^{-1} X)^{-1} X^T \hat{\Omega}^{-1} y$ is
the best linear unbiased estimator (BLUE) of $\beta$ with the covariance
matrix $cov(\hat{\beta})=(X^T \hat{\Omega}^{-1} X)^{-1}$.

## MSE

@benavent:2015 also proposed MSE estimation for the multivariate
Fay-Herriot models as follows:
$$mse(\hat{\mu}) = g_{1i}(\hat{\sigma}_u^2) + g_{2i}(\hat{\sigma}_u^2) +g_{3i}(\hat{\sigma}_u^2)$$
, where each component can be described as follows:
$$g_{1i}(\hat{\sigma}_u^2) = \Gamma V_e$$
,
$$g_{2i}(\hat{\sigma}_u^2) = (1-\Gamma)X(X^T \Omega^{-1} X)^{-1} X^T (I - \Gamma)^T$$
,
$$g_{3i}(\hat{\sigma}_u^3) \approx \Sigma\Sigma cov(\hat{\sigma}_{uk}^2 , \hat{\sigma}_{ul}^2) \Gamma_{(k)} \Omega \Gamma^T_{(k)} , k,l = 1,2,\dotsc, q$$
, where $\Gamma = Z^T\hat{V_u} Z$,
$\Gamma_{(k)} = \frac{\delta \Gamma}{\delta \sigma_u^2}$, and
$cov(\hat{\sigma}_{uk}^2 , \hat{\sigma}_{ul}^2)$ is the inverse of the
Fisher information matrix in the estimation of REML.

# Overview of R package *msae* {#overview}

The R Package *msae* implements multivariate Fay-Herriot models for
small area estimation. Here are some functions and the descriptions at a
glance:

-   `eblupUFH`: This function gives the EBLUP and MSE based on the
    univariate Fay-Herriot model (Model 0).
-   `eblupMFH1`: This function gives the EBLUP and MSE based on the
    multivariate Fay-Herriot model (Model 1).
-   `eblupMFH2`: This function gives the EBLUP and MSE based on the
    autoregressive multivariate Fay-Herriot model (Model 2).
-   `eblupMFH3`: This function gives the EBLUP and MSE based on the
    heteroskedastic autoregressive multivariate Fay-Herriot model (Model
    3).

Those functions return a list of five elements:

-   `eblup` is a data frame of EBLUPs for each variable.
-   `MSE` is a data frame of the estimated MSEs of the EBLUPs.
-   `randomEffect` is a data frame of random effect estimators.
-   `Rmatrix` is a block diagonal matrix composed of sampling variances.
-   `fit` is a list containing the following objects:
    -   `method` shows the type of fitting method.
    -   `convergence` shows the convergence of the Fisher Scoring
        algorithm.
    -   `estcoef` shows estimated model coefficients and their
        significance.
    -   `refvar` shows the estimated random effect variance.
    -   `refvarTest` (only for `eblupMFH3`) shows homogeneity of random
        effect variance test based on Model 3.
    -   `rho` (only for `eblupMFH2` and `eblupMFH3`) shows the estimated
        $\rho$ of random effect variance and their parameter test.
    -   `informationFisher` is a matrix of information Fisher.

This package also provides datasets generated for each multivariate
model. The datasets are generated based on Model 1, Model 2, and Model 3
following steps:

1.  Generate sampling error $e$ and auxiliary variables « $X1, X2$ ».
    Set the parameter as follows:

    -   For sampling error $e$ in Model 1, we set
        $e_d \sim N_3(0,V_{ed})$, where
        $V_{ed} = (\sigma_{dij})_{i,j=1,2,3}$ with
        $\sigma_{e11} \sim InvGamma(11,1), \: \sigma_{e22} \sim InvGamma(11,2), \: \sigma_{e33} \sim InvGamma(11,3), \text{ and } \rho_e = 0.5$.
        We generate different MSE of direct estimates for each area.
    -   For sampling error $e$ in Model 2 and Model 3, we set
        $e \sim N_3(0,V_e)$, where $V_e = (\sigma_{ij})_{i,j=1,2,3}$
        with
        $\sigma_{e11} = 0.1,  \: \sigma_{e22} = 0.2, \: \sigma_{e33} = 0.3 , \text{ and } \rho_e = 0.5$.
        It is shown that all the areas have the same MSE of direct
        estimates.
    -   For auxiliary variables « $X1 \: X2$ », we set
        $X1 \sim N(5,0.1) \text{ and } X2 \sim N(10,0.2)$

2.  Generate random effect $u$, where $u \sim N_3(0,V_u)$. For each
    dataset, parameter for generating random effect $u$ are as follows:

    -   For Model 1,
        $\sigma_{u11} = 0.2, \: \sigma_{u22} = 0.4, \text{ and } \sigma_{u33} = 1.2$
    -   For Model 2, $\sigma_{u} = 0.4, \text{ and } \rho_{u} = 0.8$
    -   For Model 3,
        $\sigma_{u11} = 0.2, \: \sigma_{u22} = 0.4, \: \sigma_{u33} = 1.2, \text{ and } \rho_{u} = 0.8$

3.  Set $\beta_1=5$ and $\beta_2=10$ to calculate direct estimation «
    $Y1,\: Y2, \text{ and } Y3$ », where $Y_i = X\beta + u_i + e_i$.

4.  Auxiliary variables « $X1$ and $X2$ », direct estimates « $Y1, Y2,$
    and $Y3$ », and sampling variance-covariance «
    $v1, v2, v3, v12, v13,$ and $v23$ » are combined into a data frame
    called `datasae1` for Model 1, `datasae2` for Model 2, and
    `datasae3` for Model 3.

# Example 1. The multivariate Fay-Herriot model (Model 1) {#example}

`datasae1`, which is generated based on Model 1, contains 50
observations on the following 11 variables: 3 dependent variables «
$Y1, Y2,$ and $Y3$ », 2 auxiliary variables « $X1$ and $X2$ », and 6
variance-covariance of direct estimation « $v1, v2, v3, v12, v13,$ and
$v23$ ». The procedures for generating such datasets are provided in the
previous section. The following R commands are run to obtain EBLUPs of
the univariate Fay-Herriot model (Model 0) and the multivariate
Fay-Herriot model (Model 1), plot the EBLUPs of the univariate and
multivarate model, and plot the MSEs of EBLUPs in the univariate and
multivarate model:

Figure [1](#figure:eblup-m1) illustrates the EBLUPs based on Model 0
(univariate model) and Model 1 (multivariate model) for all variables of
interest. Figure [2](#figure:mse-m1) shows the MSEs of Model 1 compared
with the MSEs of Model 0. It can be seen that the estimates of both
methods show a similar pattern. Meanwhile, EBLUPs based on Model 1 has a
lower MSE than Model 0. From this example, we can conclude that the
multivariate Fay-Herriot model (Model 1) is more efficient than the
univariate Fay-Herriot model (Model 0).

# Example 2. The autoregressive multivariate Fay-Herriot model (Model 2)

`datasae2`, which was generated based on Model 2, contains 50
observations on the following 11 variables: 3 dependent variables «
$Y1, Y2$ and $Y3$ », 2 auxiliary variables « $X1$ and $X2$ », and 6
variance-covariance of direct estimation « $v1, v2, v3, v12, v13,$ and
$v23$ ». We compare the effectiveness of the univariate model (Model 0)
and autoregressive multivariate Fay-Herriot Model (Model 2) by their
MSE. We use `eblupMFH2()` to estimate parameters based on Model 2. Then,
we plot the EBLUP and MSE of these methods to compare them.

``` r
data('datasae2')

# model specifications
Fo <- list(f1=Y1~X1+X2,
            f2=Y2~X1+X2,
            f3=Y3~X1+X2)
vardir <- c("v1", "v2", "v3", "v12", "v13", "v23")

# EBLUP based on Model 0 and Model 2
u <- eblupUFH(Fo, vardir, data=datasae2)  # Model 0
m2 <- eblupMFH2(Fo, vardir, data=datasae2)  # Model 2
```

The EBLUPs based on Model 0 (univariate model) and Model 1
(autoregressive multivariate model) are shown in
Figure [3](#figure:eblup-m2). As it can be seen, both methods show an
almost similar result. However, EBLUPs based on Model 2 has a lower MSE
than the EBLUPs based on Model 0, as shown in
Figure [4](#figure:mse-m2). In this example, the autoregressive
multivariate Fay-Herriot model (Model 2) seems to be more efficient than
the univariate Fay-Herriot model (Model 0).

# Example 3. Heteroskedastic autoregressive multivariate Fay-Herriot model (Model 3)

`datasae3`, which was generated based on Model 3, is structured the same
as `datasae1` and `datasae2`. We compare the effectiveness of the
univariate model (Model 0) and heteroskedastic autoregressive
multivariate Fay-Herriot Model (Model 3) by their MSE. We use
`eblupMFH3()` to estimate parameters based on Model 3. Then, we plot the
EBLUP and MSE of these methods to compare them.

``` r
data('datasae3')

# model specifications 
Fo <- list(f1=Y1~X1+X2,
            f2=Y2~X1+X2,
            f3=Y3~X1+X2)
vardir <- c("v1", "v2", "v3", "v12", "v13", "v23")

# EBLUP based on Model 0 and Model 3
u <- eblupUFH(Fo, vardir, data=datasae3)  # Model 0
m3 <- eblupMFH3(Fo, vardir, data=datasae3)  # Model 3
```

Figure [5](#figure:eblup-m3) shows EBLUPs based on Model 3 compared to
Model 0. The MSEs of both methods are shown in
Figure [6](#figure:mse-m3). It can be seen that the multivariate EBLUPs
will follow the pattern of univariate EBLUPs with smaller MSE values. It
can be concluded that the heteroskedastic autoregressive multivariate
Fay-Herriot model (Model 3) is more efficient than the univariate model
(Model 0).

# Real data example: Poverty index

In this section, we use `incomedata` dataset, which is provided in
library *sae*. The dataset contains unit-level data on income and other
related variables in Spain. We will demonstrate how to estimate the
EBLUP of Foster-Greer-Thorbecke (FGT) poverty index for each province
using the multivariate Fay-Herriot Models. The index consists of three
indicators, i.e., poverty proportion (p0), poverty gap (p1), and poverty
severity (p2).

``` r
library(sae)
data("incomedata")
```

Firstly, we obtain area-level data by calculating poverty indicators for
each unit and aggregating it by province based on @benavent:2015. We use
poverty line z=6557.143 [@sae:2015]. These following R commands are run
to obtain $p0$, $p1$, and $p2$ as variables of interest.

``` r
library(tidyverse)

pov.line <- rep(6557.143, dim(incomedata)[1]) # poverty line

# calculate unit indictators
incomedata$y <- (pov.line - incomedata$income)/pov.line
incomedata = incomedata %>% mutate(poverty = ifelse(incomedata$y > 0, TRUE, FALSE),
                                   y0 = ifelse(incomedata$y > 0, incomedata$y^0, 0),
                                   y1 = ifelse(incomedata$y > 0, incomedata$y^1, 0),
                                   y2 = ifelse(incomedata$y > 0, incomedata$y^2, 0))

# estimated domain size
est.Nd <- aggregate(incomedata$weight, list(incomedata$prov), sum)[,2]

## estimate P0 P1 dan P2
prov.est = incomedata %>% group_by(prov) %>%
  summarise(p0.prov = sum(weight*y0),
            p1.prov = sum(weight*y1),
            p2.prov = sum(weight*y2)) %>%
  mutate(p0.prov = p0.prov / est.Nd,
         p1.prov = p1.prov / est.Nd,
         p2.prov = p2.prov / est.Nd)
incomedata <- incomedata %>% left_join(prov.est, by = c("prov" = "prov"))
```

We also need variance and covariance of variables of interest to
estimate using the multivariate Fay-Herriot model. The following R
commands are run to obtain variance and covariance of direct estimation
based on @benavent:2015.

``` r
# estimate  direct estimation variance-covariance
prov.variance = incomedata %>%
  mutate(v11 = ifelse(incomedata$poverty,
                      (weight*(weight-1))*(y0-p0.prov)*(y0-p0.prov), 0),
         v12 = ifelse(incomedata$poverty,
                      (weight*(weight-1))*(y0-p0.prov)*(y1-p1.prov), 0),
         v13 = ifelse(incomedata$poverty,
                      (weight*(weight-1))*(y0-p0.prov)*(y2-p2.prov), 0),
         v22 = ifelse(incomedata$poverty,
                      (weight*(weight-1))*(y1-p1.prov)*(y1-p1.prov), 0),
         v23 = ifelse(incomedata$poverty,
                      (weight*(weight-1))*(y1-p1.prov)*(y2-p2.prov), 0),
         v33 = ifelse(incomedata$poverty,
                      (weight*(weight-1))*(y2-p2.prov)*(y2-p2.prov), 0)) %>%
  group_by(prov) %>%
  summarise_at(c("v11","v12", "v13", 'v22',"v23","v33"), sum) %>%
  mutate_at(c("v11","v12", "v13", 'v22',"v23","v33"),
            function(x){x/est.Nd^2})
```

We use six explanatory variables selected by stepwise method, i.e., an
indicator of age group 50-64 ($age4$), an indicator of age group \>=65
($age5$), an indicator of education level 1 ($educ1$), an indicator of
education level 2 ($educ2$), an indicator of education level 3
($educ3$), and an indicator of Spanish nationality ($nat1$). The model
specifications are written as follow:

``` r
formula <- list(f1=p0.prov~age4+age5+educ1+educ2+educ3+nat1,
            f2=p1.prov~age4+age5+educ1+educ2+educ3+nat1,
            f3=p2.prov~age4+age5+educ1+educ2+educ3+nat1)
vardir <- c("v11", "v22", "v33", "v12", "v13", "v23")
```

Next, we select the most suitable multivariate Fay-Herriot model using
variance homogeneity test and random effect $\rho$ parameter test. In
the variance homogeneity test, we test
$H0 : \hat{\sigma}_{ui}^2 = \hat{\sigma}_{uj}^2 \: ; \: i,j=1,2,3$ using
model 3. We obtain a non-convergent model, the p-values are 0.98674 and
0.98996. It shows that the difference between variance of random effects
is statistically not significant. After that, we test $H0 : \rho = 0$
using model 2. We get the t-statistics value of 19.26 with p-value of
0.00. It shows that there is a correlation between random effects. These
results indicate the model that fits the data is Model 2.

The following codes are run to obtain the EBLUPs (under Model 2), to
plot the direct estimates and the EBLUPs, and to plot the MSEs of direct
estimates and the MSEs of EBLUPs ordered by sample size:

``` r

  : Table 1: Statistics of direct estimation and Model 2
:::

We will compare EBLUPs based on Model 2 with the direct estimates. Both
of the estimation results can be seen in Table [1](#table:stat). On the
median value, the result of estimated poverty indicators are relatively
similar, ranging from 0.218-0.219 for p0, 0.0681-0.0687 for p1, and
0.0323-0.0336 for p2. Model 2 has a lower range and smaller standard
deviation than the direct estimation. It means that, in general, the
multivariate Fay-Herriot model has lower variability of small area
estimates than direct estimation.

p2 ordered by sample size.](real-case.png){#figure:real-case

p0, p1, and p2 ordered by sample
size.](mse-real-case.png){#figure:mse-real-case width="100%"
alt="graphic without alt text"}

The results of direct estimates and EBLUPs under Model 2 ordered by
sample size are shown in Figure [7](#figure:real-case). The patterns of
small area estimates for both methods are almost the same for all areas.
The MSEs of the direct estimates and the EBLUP estimates ordered by
sample size are shown in Figure [8](#figure:mse-real-case). These plots
show that the multivariate Fay-Herriot model has lower MSE than the
direct estimation. Thus, we can conclude that the multivariate
Fay-Herriot model is more efficient than direct estimation.

# Conclusion

This paper introduces the first R package of multivariate Fay-Herriot
model for small area estimation named *msae*. The package is available
on Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN) at
<http://CRAN.R-project.org/package=msae>. This package contains a number
of functions for estimating the EBLUP and MSE of EBLUP of each
Fay-Herriot Model. This package accommodates the univariate Fay-Herriot
model (model 0), multivariate Fay-Herriot model (model 1),
autoregressive multivariate Fay-Herriot model (model 2), and
heteroskedastic autoregressive multivariate Fay-Herriot model (model 3).
The functions are described and implemented using three examples of
datasets provided in *msae* package and a real dataset provided in *sae*
package, `incomedata`. By these examples, we show that the multivariate
Fay-herriot models produce more efficient parameter estimates than
direct estimation and univariate model.
