title: 'openEBGM: An R Implementation of the Gamma-Poisson Shrinker Data Mining Model'
abstract: We introduce the R package openEBGM, an implementation of the Gamma-Poisson
  Shrinker (GPS) model for identifying unexpected counts in large contingency tables
  using an empirical Bayes approach. The Empirical Bayes Geometric Mean (EBGM) and
  quantile scores are obtained from the GPS model estimates. openEBGM provides for
  the evaluation of counts using a number of different methods, including the model-based
  disproportionality scores, the relative reporting ratio (RR), and the proportional
  reporting ratio (PRR). Data squashing for computational efficiency and stratification
  for confounding variable adjustment are included. Application to adverse event detection
  is discussed.
