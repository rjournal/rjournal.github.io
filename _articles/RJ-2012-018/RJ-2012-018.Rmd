title: The State of Naming Conventions in R
abstract: Most programming language communities have naming conventions that are generally
  agreed upon, that is, a set of rules that governs how functions and variables are
  named. This is not the case with R, and a review of unofficial style guides and
  naming convention usage on CRAN shows that a number of different naming conventions
  are currently in use. Some naming conventions are, however, more popular than others
  and as a newcomer to the R community or as a developer of a new package this could
  be useful to consider when choosing what naming convention to adopt.
