title: Integration of networks and pathways with StarBioTrek package
abstract: High-throughput genomic technologies bring to light a comprehensive hallmark
  of molecular changes of a disease. It is increasingly evident that genes are not
  isolated from each other and the identification of a gene signature can only partially
  elucidate the de-regulated biological functions in a disease. The comprehension
  of how groups of genes (pathways) are related to each other (pathway cross talk)
  could explain biological mechanisms causing diseases. Biological pathways are important
  tools to identify gene interactions and decrease the large number of genes to be
  studied by partitioning them into smaller groups. Furthermore, recent scientific
  studies have demonstrated that an integration of pathways and networks, instead
  of a single component of the pathway or a single network, could lead to a deeper
  understanding of the pathology. StarBioTrek is an R package for the integration
  of biological pathways and networks which provides a series of functions to support
  the user in their analyses. In particular, it implements algorithms to identify
  pathways cross-talk networks and gene network drivers in pathways. It is available
  as open source and open development software in the Bioconductor platform.
