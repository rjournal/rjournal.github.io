title: 'Rankcluster: An R Package for Clustering Multivariate Partial Rankings'
abstract: The Rankcluster package is the first R package proposing both modeling and
  clustering tools for ranking data, potentially multivariate and partial. Ranking
  data are modeled by the Insertion Sorting Rank (ISR) model, which is a meaningful
  model parametrized by a central ranking and a dispersion parameter. A conditional
  independence assumption allows multivariate rankings to be taken into account, and
  clustering is performed by means of mixtures of multivariate ISR models. The parameters
  of the cluster (central rankings and dispersion parameters) help the practitioners
  to interpret the clustering. Moreover, the Rankcluster package provides an estimate
  of the missing ranking positions when rankings are partial. After an overview of
  the mixture of multivariate ISR models, the Rankcluster package is described and
  its use is illustrated through the analysis of two real datasets.
