title: Comparing namedCapture with other R packages for regular expressions
abstract: Regular expressions are powerful tools for manipulating non-tabular textual
  data. For many tasks (visualization, machine learning, etc), tables of numbers must
  be extracted from such data before processing by other R functions. We present the
  R package namedCapture, which facilitates such tasks by providing a new user-friendly
  syntax for defining regular expressions in R code. We begin by describing the history
  of regular expressions and their usage in R. We then describe the new features of
  the namedCapture package, and provide detailed comparisons with related R packages
  (rex, stringr, stringi, tidyr, rematch2, re2r).
