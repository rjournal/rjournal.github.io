title: 'rlme: An R Package for Rank-Based Estimation and Prediction in Random Effects
  Nested Models'
abstract: There is a lack of robust statistical analyses for random effects linear
  models. In practice, statistical analyses, including estimation, prediction and
  inference, are not reliable when data are unbalanced, of small size, contain outliers,
  or not normally distributed. It is fortunate that rank-based regression analysis
  is a robust nonparametric alternative to likelihood and least squares analysis.
  We propose an R package that calculates rank-based statistical analyses for twoand
  three-level random effects nested designs. In this package, a new algorithm which
  recursively obtains robust predictions for both scale and random effects is used,
  along with three rank-based fitting methods.
