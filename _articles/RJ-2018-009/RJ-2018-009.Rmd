title: 'Simple Features for R: Standardized Support for Spatial Vector Data'
abstract: Simple features are a standardized way of encoding spatial vector data (points,
  lines, polygons) in computers. The sf package implements simple features in R, and
  has roughly the same capacity for spatial vector data as packages sp, rgeos, and
  rgdal. We describe the need for this package, its place in the R package ecosystem,
  and its potential to connect R to other computer systems. We illustrate this with
  examples of its use.
