title: Analysing Seasonal Data
abstract: 'Many common diseases, such as the flu and cardiovascular disease, increase
  markedly in winter and dip in summer. These seasonal patterns have been part of
  life for millennia and were first noted in ancient Greece by both Hippocrates and
  Herodotus. Recent interest has focused on climate change, and the concern that seasons
  will become more extreme with harsher winter and summer weather. We describe a set
  of R functions designed to model seasonal patterns in disease. We illustrate some
  simple descriptive and graphical methods, a more complex method that is able to
  model non-stationary patterns, and the case-crossover to control for seasonal confounding.
  In this paper we illustrate some of the functions of the season package (Barnett
  et al., 2012), which contains a range of functions for analysing seasonal health
  data. We were motivated by the great interest in seasonality found in the health
  literature, and the relatively small number of seasonal tools in R (or other software
  packages). The existing seasonal tools in R are: • the baysea function of the timsac
  package and the decompose and stl functions of the stats package for decomposing
  a time series into a trend and season; • the dynlm function of the dynlm package
  and the ssm function of the sspir package for fitting dynamic linear models with
  optional seasonal components; • the arima function of the stats package and the
  Arima function of the forecast package for fitting seasonal components as part of
  an autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) model; and • the bfast package
  for detecting breaks in a seasonal pattern. These tools are all useful, but most
  concern decomposing equally spaced time series data. Our package includes models
  that can be applied to seasonal patterns in unequally spaced data. Such data are
  common in observational studies when the timing of responses cannot be controlled
  (e.g. for a postal survey). In the health literature much of the analysis of seasonal
  data uses simple methods such as com paring rates of disease by month or using a
  cosinor regression model, which assumes a sinusoidal seasonal pattern. We have created
  functions for these simple, but often very effective analyses, as we describe below.
  More complex seasonal analyses examine non-stationary seasonal patterns that change
  over time. Changing seasonal patterns in health are currently of great interest
  as global warming is predicted to make seasonal changes in the weather more extreme.
  Hence there is a need for statistical tools that can estimate whether a seasonal
  pattern has become more extreme over time or whether its phase has changed. Ours
  is also the first R package that includes the case-crossover, a useful method for
  controlling for seasonality. This paper illustrates just some of the functions of
  the season package. We show some descriptive functions that give simple means or
  plots, and functions whose goal is inference based on generalised linear models.
  The package was written as a companion to a book on seasonal analysis by Barnett
  and Dobson (2010), which contains further details on the statistical methods and
  R code.'
