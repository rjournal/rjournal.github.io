title: 'IsoGeneGUI: Multiple Approaches for Dose-Response Analysis of Microarray Data
  Using R'
abstract: The analysis of transcriptomic experiments with ordered covariates, such
  as dose-response data, has become a central topic in bioinformatics, in particular
  in omics studies. Consequently, multiple R packages on CRAN and Bioconductor are
  designed to analyse microarray data from various perspectives under the assumption
  of order restriction. We introduce the new R package IsoGene Graphical User Interface
  (IsoGeneGUI), an extension of the original IsoGene package that includes methods
  from most of available R packages designed for the analysis of order restricted
  microarray data, namely orQA, ORIClust, goric and ORCME. The methods included in
  the new IsoGeneGUI range from inference and estimation to model selection and clustering
  tools. The IsoGeneGUI is not only the most complete tool for the analysis of order
  restricted microarray experiments available in R but also it can be used to analyse
  other types of dose-response data. The package provides all the methods in a user
  friendly fashion, so analyses can be implemented by users with limited knowledge
  of R programming.
