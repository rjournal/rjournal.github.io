title: 'Consistency Cubes: a fast, efficient method for exact Boolean minimization.'
abstract: A lot of effort has been spent over the past few decades in the QCA methodology
  field, to develop efficient Boolean minimization algorithms to derive an exact,
  and more importantly complete list of minimal prime implicants that explain the
  initial, observed positive configurations. As the complexity grows exponentially
  with every new condition, the required computer memory goes past the current computer
  resources and the polynomial time required to solve this problem quickly grows towards
  infinity. This paper introduces a new alternative to the existing non-polynomial
  attempts. It completely solves the memory problem, and preliminary tests show it
  is exponentially hundreds of time faster than eQMC, the current “best” algorithm
  for QCA in R, and probes into a territory where it competes and even outperforms
  engineering algorithms such as Espresso, for exact minimizations. While speed is
  not much of an issue now (eQMC is fast enough for simple data), it might prove to
  be essential when further developing towards all possible temporal orders, or searching
  for configurations in panel data over time, combined with / or automatic detection
  of difficult counterfactuals etc.
