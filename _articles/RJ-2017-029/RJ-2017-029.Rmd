title: 'flan: An R Package for Inference on Mutation Models.'
abstract: This paper describes flan, a package providing tools for fluctuation analysis
  of mutant cell counts. It includes functions dedicated to the distribution of final
  numbers of mutant cells. Parametric estimation and hypothesis testing are also implemented,
  enabling inference on different sorts of data with several possible methods. An
  overview of the subject is proposed. The general form of mutation models is described,
  including the classical models as particular cases. Estimating from a model, when
  the data have been generated by another, induces different possible biases, which
  are identified and discussed. The three estimation methods available in the package
  are described, and their mean squared errors are compared. Finally, implementation
  is discussed, and a few examples of usage on real data sets are given.
