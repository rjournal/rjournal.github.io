title: 'HDiR: An R Package for Computation and Nonparametric Plug-in Estimation of
  Directional Highest Density Regions and General Level Sets'
abstract: A deeper understanding of a distribution support, being able to determine
  regions of a certain (possibly high) probability content is an important task in
  several research fields. Package HDiR for R is designed for exact computation of
  directional (circular and spherical) highest density regions and density level sets
  when the density is fully known. Otherwise, HDiR implements nonparametric plug-in
  methods based on different kernel density estimates for reconstructing this kind
  of sets. Additionally, it also allows the computation and plug-in estimation of
  level sets for general functions (not necessarily a density). Some exploratory tools,
  such as suitably adapted distances and scatterplots, are also implemented. Two original
  datasets and spherical density models are used for illustrating HDiR functionalities.
