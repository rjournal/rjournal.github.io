title: 'HDiR: An R Package for Computation and Nonparametric Plug-in Estimation of
  Directional Highest Density Regions and General Level Sets'
abstract: A deeper understanding of a distribution support, being able to determine
  regions of a certain (possibly high) probability content is an important task in
  several research fields. Package *HDiR* for R is designed for exact computation
  of directional (circular and spherical) highest density regions and density level
  sets when the density is fully known. Otherwise, *HDiR* implements nonparametric
  plug-in methods based on different kernel density estimates for reconstructing this
  kind of sets. Additionally, it also allows the computation and plug-in estimation
  of level sets for general functions (not necessarily a density). Some exploratory
  tools, such as suitably adapted distances and scatterplots, are also implemented.
  Two original datasets and spherical density models are used for illustrating *HDiR*
  functionalities.

# An overview on directional general level sets and highest density regions

When analyzing a data distribution, it is often the case that for a
deeper understanding of the modelling problem, it is interesting to
determine regions on the density support exceeding a certain threshold
on the density function values. These regions are known as density level
sets and, if the density is unknown, such a task can be accomplished
from a set estimation perspective. Set estimation deals with the problem
of reconstructing a set (or estimating any of its features such as its
boundary or its volume) from a random sample of points intimately
related to it. Since [@hartigan1975clustering] establishes the notion of
clusters as connected components of a density level set, the
reconstruction of this particular type of sets has been widely
considered in the literature (mainly for densities supported on an
Euclidean space). There are only very few contributions where density
level set theory has been extended to more general domains such as the
unit sphere or manifolds. [@cuevas2006plug] consider the estimation of
level sets for general functions (not necessarily a density) such as
regression curves, providing some consistency theoretical results and
showing a density level set on the sphere for illustration. More
recently, the reconstruction of density level sets on manifolds is
studied in [@cholaquidis2020level], who also presents some simulations
illustrating the performance of their approach on the torus and on the
sphere.

Let $X$ be a random vector taking values on a $d-$dimensional unit
sphere $S^{d-1}$ with density $f$ and $t>0$, the goal of (directional)
density level set estimation is to reconstruct the set
$$\label{G(t)}
G_f(t)=\{x\in S^{d-1}:f(x)\geq t\}.   (\#eq:G-t)$$
from a random sample of points $\mathcal{X}_n= \{X_1,\cdots,X_n\}$ of
$X$ when $f$ is unknown. As an illustration, some (theoretical) level
sets are shown in Figure [1](#ltau) by representing $G_f(t)$ for a
circular (left) and a spherical density (right) when three different
values of the level $t$ are chosen. The threshold $t$ is represented
through a dotted line for the circular case. Note that, if large values
of $t$ are considered, $G_f(t)$ coincides with the greatest modes of the
circular/spherical distribution. However, for small values of $t$, the
level set $G_f(t)$ is practically equal to the support of the
distribution. Therefore, cluster definition via connected components in
[@hartigan1975clustering] is clearly related to the notion of mode. Note
also that the computation of the number of modes considering the values
of a density over a certain range of values for the level $t$, would
enable the construction of a directional cluster tree.
[@azzalini2007clustering] already present this statistical tool for
Euclidean data. Moreover, the association between clusters and modes is
the basis of modal clustering methodology (see [@menardi2016review] for
a review on this topic). Most modal clustering algorithms are based on
the application of a mode-seeking numerical method to the sample points
and assigning the same cluster to those data that are iteratively
shifted to the same limit value. Examples of such procedures include the
mean shift algorithm that has been already studied in $S^{d-1}$ (see,
for instance, [@chang2010mean] and [@yang2014mean]).

![Figure 1: For a circular density (left) and a spherical density
(right), level set $G_f(t)$ for $t=t_1$, $t=t_2$ and $t=t_3$ verifying
$0<t_1<t_2<t_3$. Equivalently, HDR $L(f_\tau)$ for $\tau=\tau_1=0.2$,
$\tau=\tau_2=0.5$ and $\tau=\tau_3=0.8$.](ltau.png){#ltau width="100%"
alt="graphic without alt text"}

Despite a practitioner may be interested in determining this type of
regions, the value of the level $t$ could be (in principle) unknown in
real situations. In practice, it is quite common to assume that the set
in (\@ref(eq:G-t)) must satisfy a probability content previously
established. Following [@box1973bayesian], [@hyndman1996computing] and,
more recently, [@azzalini2007clustering], [@saavedra2020nonparametric]
generalize the definition of HDRs from the Euclidean to the directional
setting, providing a plug-in estimation method. Specifically, HDRs are a
kind of density level sets where the set probability content is fixed
instead of the level $t$. The estimation of HDRs involves further
complexities given that the threshold must be computed from the
previously fixed probability content. Formally, given $\tau\in(0,1)$,
the $100(1 - \tau)$% HDR is the subset
$$\label{conjuntonivel2}
L(f_\tau)=\{x\in S^{d-1}:f(x)\geq f_\tau\},   (\#eq:conjuntonivel2)$$
where $f_\tau$ can be seen as the largest constant such that
$$\mathbb{P}(X\in L(f_\tau))\geq 1-\tau,$$
with respect to the distribution induced by $f$. Figure [1](#ltau) also
shows the HDR $L(f_\tau)$ for a circular and a spherical densities with
three different values of $\tau$. Note that, if large values of $\tau$
are considered, $L(f_\tau)$ is equal to the greatest modes and the most
distinct clusters can be easily identified. However, for small values of
$\tau$, $L(f_\tau)$ is almost equal to the support of the distribution.

To sum up, given a value of $t$, the computation of the level set
established in (\@ref(eq:G-t)) (and of its connected components) is a
quite simple mathematical task when $f$ is known. Under this assumption
and taking a fixed $\tau\in (0,1)$, determining the HDR introduced in
(\@ref(eq:conjuntonivel2)) presents a similar complexity but, in this
case, it is additionally necessary to determine the threshold $f_\tau$.
In particular, numerical integration methods can be applied to solve
that problem. However, when the density $f$ is assumed to be unknown and
a random sample $\mathcal{X}_n\in S^{d-1}$ generated from $f$ is the
only available information to reconstruct the set, nonparametric set
estimation techniques such as plug-in methods must be considered in
order to reconstruct the connected components of the set. Perhaps due to
its practical importance, Euclidean HDRs plug-in algorithms based on
kernel smoothing have been widely studied even solving the problem of
selecting an appropriate smoothing parameter specifically devised for
the HDR reconstruction (see [@baillo2006parametric],
[@samworth2010asymptotics] or [@casa2020modal]). In the directional
setting, given that a proper definition of the HDR $L(f_\tau)$ was not
available, no work on this area had been carried out until the recent
contribution by [@saavedra2020nonparametric].

The contents of this paper, describing the contributions in
[*HDiR*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=HDiR), mainly focus on
computation and plug-in estimation of highest density regions (HDRs) and
density level sets in the circle and the sphere. Although general level
sets can be also analysed using *HDiR*, we will not formally detail
aspects on their computation and on their plug-in reconstruction given
that they can be seen as a direct generalisation of those introduced for
density level sets by replacing the density by the general function
under study. Therefore, with the objective of showing the capabilities
of the *HDiR* package for exact computation of directional HDRs and
density level sets when $f$ is known and for plug-in estimation
otherwise, this paper is organized as follows. First, a basic overview
on nonparametric plug-in estimation methods is given. Initially, the
classical directional kernel density estimator is briefly introduced, as
it is the key tool for plug-in reconstruction and exploratory methods.
Then, the problems of threshold estimation (with known and unknown
density) and specific bandwidth selection for HDRs are considered.
Circular confidence regions for HDRs are also established. Next, the
reader will find a guided tour across *HDiR* package, illustrating its
use with simulated examples first and with two real data examples later.
Following the perspective in [@cuevas2006plug], *HDiR* also allows the
computation and plug-in estimation of general level sets. A
reconstruction example of a (circular) regression level set is detailed.
Moreover, distances between sets and circular/spherical scatterplots are
also described as exploratory tools. Finally, some discussion is
provided, considering on the possible extensions of the package.

# Plug-in estimation methods {#sec:2}

This section provides a brief background on the design of plug-in tools
included in *HDiR* for directional (circular and spherical) HDR and
density level set estimation. Following [@cuevas2006plug], if a
nonparametric estimator is available for a general function, this
methodology may be directly extended for reconstructing the
corresponding level sets.

## Plug-in estimation methods for HDRs and level sets {#HDRsplugin}

Although there are other nonparametric alternative routes for level set
estimation, the plug-in approach has received considerable attention in
the Euclidean literature (see [@tsybakov1997nonparametric],
[@baillo2003total], [@mason2009asymptotic], [@rigollet2009optimal],
[@mammen2013confidence] or [@chen2017density]). This is with no doubt a
natural methodology, which can be generalized to the directional setting
as in [@saavedra2020nonparametric]. Given that level set estimation is a
simpler problem than HDR reconstruction, we will restrict to this last
setting in what follows. Given a random sample
$\mathcal{X}_n\in S^{d-1}$ of the unknown directional density $f$,
plug-in methods reconstruct the $100(1 - \tau)$% HDR namely $L(f_\tau)$
in (\@ref(eq:conjuntonivel2)) as
$$\label{Ltauest}
\hat{L}(\hat{f}_\tau)=\{x\in S^{d-1}:f_n(x)\geq \hat{f}_\tau\},   (\#eq:Ltauest)$$
where $\hat{f}_\tau$ is an estimator of the threshold $f_\tau$ and $f_n$
denotes a nonparametric directional density estimator. Package *HDiR*
implements the kernel density estimator provided in [@bai1989kernel]
($d>2$). From $\mathcal{X}_n$, it is defined at a point $x\in S^{d-1}$
as
$$\label{estimacionnucleo}
f_n(x)= \frac{1}{n}  \sum_{i=1}^n K_{vM}(x;X_i;1/h^2),   (\#eq:estimacionnucleo)$$
where $K_{vM}$ denotes the von Mises-Fisher kernel density and
$1/h^2 > 0$ is the concentration parameter.

Following [@bai1989kernel], package *HDiR* also enables to use any
kernel function (not necessarily the von Mises-Fisher density
implemented by default). An example where an uniform kernel is
considered will be presented later. Even more generally, *HDiR* would
allow the user to define different density estimators that the one
introduced in (\@ref(eq:estimacionnucleo)). See, for instance,
[@pelletier2005kernel].

As for the concentration parameter $1/h^2$, it plays an analogous role
to the bandwidth in the Euclidean case. For small values of $1/h^2$, the
density estimator is oversmoothed. The opposite effect is obtained as
$1/h^2$ increases. Hence, the choice of $h$ is a crucial issue. For
simplicity, in what follows, we refer to $h$ as bandwidth parameter.
Many approaches for selecting $h$ in practice, in circular and even
directional settings, have been proposed in the literature (see
[@taylor2008automatic], [@oliveira2012plug], [@hall1987kernel],
[@di2011kernel] or [@garcia2013exact]). All these existing proposals
designed for density estimation are implemented in the package *NPCirc*
and their aim is to minimize some error criterion on the target density.
However, such a bandwidth selector may not be adequate for HDRs or level
set estimation. As far as we know, such a tool was not available in the
directional setting until the selector by [@saavedra2020nonparametric].
It is also available in package *HDiR*. Different plug-in estimators for
HDRs emerge from the consideration of all these bandwith selectors.

For the circular and the spherical densities shown in Figure [1](#ltau),
now Figure [2](#ltauest2) contains the HDR plug-in estimators (bluish
colours) for $\tau=0.5$ computed using cross-validation bandwidths and
samples of sizes $n=100$ and $n=500$, respectively. Although the
theoretical circular HDR is composed by three connected components (see
Figure [1](#ltau)), the plug-in estimator is able to detect only the two
biggest clusters when $n=100$. In order to assess the agreement of a
given estimate with the theoretical target, distances between sets are
the usual tools to measure the discrepancies between the theoretical
sets and the corresponding empirical reconstructions. One of the most
common distances in the Euclidean setting is the Hausdorff distance
between the boundaries of both sets.

![Figure 2: For the circular density shown in Figure [1](#ltau) (first
row), $\hat{L}(\hat{f}_\tau)$ (bluish colour) for $\tau=\tau_2=0.5$

alt="graphic without alt text"}

If the target is the reconstruction of a HDR or a density level set, the
Hausdorff metric is a suitable error criterion in the directional
setting (see [@cuevas2006plug] and [@cholaquidis2020level]). If $A$ and
$B$ are non-empty compact sets in the $d-$dimensional Euclidean space,
the Hausdorff distance between $A$ and $B$ is defined as follows
$$d_H(A,B)=\max\left\{\sup_{x\in A}d_E\left(\{x\},B\right),\sup_{y\in B}d_E\left(\{y\},A\right)\right\},$$
where $d_E(\{x\},B)=\inf_{y\in B}\{d_E(x,y)\}$ being $d_E(x,y)$ the
Euclidean distance between two points. However, this metric $d_H$ is not
completely successful in detecting shape-related differences. For
instance, two sets can be very close in Hausdorff distance and still
show quite different shapes. This typically happens where the boundaries
$\partial A$ and $\partial B$ are far apart, no matter the proximity of
$A$ and $B$. So, a natural way to reinforce the notion of visual
proximity between two sets provided by Hausdorff distance is to account
also for the proximity of their respective boundaries. In particular,
Hausdorff distance between the boundaries of the theoretical HDR and its
plug-in reconstruction is a measure of the estimation error. *HDiR*
allows to compute Euclidean and Hausdorff distances between the
frontiers of two arbitrary sets on the circle and on the sphere.

### Threshold estimation and confidence regions for HDRs {#threshold}

For a given $\tau\in (0,1)$, determining the set $L(f_\tau)$ in
(\@ref(eq:conjuntonivel2)) and its plug-in estimator
$\hat{L}(\hat{f}_{\tau})$ in (\@ref(eq:Ltauest)) involve the exact
computation and the estimation of the threshold $f_\tau$, respectively.
As in the Euclidean setting, both tasks require the use of numerical
integration methods. Specifically, *HDiR* uses the classical trapezoidal
rule in the circular setting. However, for the spherical case, the
computational cost becomes a major issue due to the complexity of the
numerical integration algorithms considered on high dimensional spaces.
It should be noted that package
[*SphericalCubature*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=SphericalCubature)
includes some functions for solving numerical integration over spheres.
However, it does not provide sufficiently accurate solutions for our
problem.

An alternative approach is implemented in the internal function
`sphere.integration` of *HDiR*. Specifically, the proposed numerical
integration procedure on the sphere requires the definition of a
triangular mesh, such as the ones depicted in Figure [3](#mesh),
obtained from the projection over the sphere of triangular meshes on an
embedded icosaedrum. This type of mesh guarantees that there is not a
prevailing direction. For computing the corresponding spherical
integral, the Cartesian coordinates of the mesh vertices are transformed
into spherical coordinates and standard quadrature formulae are applied
in each triangle over the plane formed by the azimuthal and polar angles
(see [@strang73]).

triangular cells. </figcaption>
</figure>

Package *HDiR* additionally includes a computationally feasible approach
for estimating $f_{\tau}$ in the circular and spherical context. As
before, let $X$ be a random vector with directional density $f$ and let
$Y=f(X)$ be the random vector obtained by transforming $X$ by its own
density function. Since $\mathbb{P}(f(X)\geq f_\tau)=1-\tau$, $f_{\tau}$
is exactly the $\tau-$ quantile of $Y$. [@saavedra2020nonparametric]
establish that $f_{\tau}$ can be estimated as a sample quantile from a
set of independent and identically distributed random vectors with the
same distribution as $Y$. In particular, if
$\mathcal X_n=\{X_1,\cdots,X_{n}\}$ denotes a set of independent
observations in $S^{d-1}$ from a density $f$,
$\{f(X_1), \cdots, f(X_n)\}$ is a set of independent observations from
the distribution of $Y$. Let $f_{(j)}$ be the $j-$th largest value of
$\{f(X_i)\}_{i=1}^n$ so that $f_{(j)}$ is the $(j/n)$ sample quantile of
$Y$. We shall use $f_{(j)}$ as an estimate of $f_\tau$. Specifically, we
choose $\hat{f}_\tau=f_{(j)}$ where $j=\lfloor \tau n\rfloor$. Threshold
values in Figure [2](#ltauest2) were estimated following this approach.

This estimation method presents a lower computational complexity than
numerical integration algorithms. Furthermore, it involves a statistical
approximation. Therefore, it is possible to establish confidence
intervals in order to quantify uncertainty in estimates of $f_{\tau}$
and, as direct consequence, to establish confidence regions for HDR's.
Following [@hyndman1996computing], the simplest case where $X$ is a
circular random variable is considered by [@saavedra2020nonparametric].
Standard asymptotic results for a sample in [@cox1979theoretical] ensure
that $\hat{f}_{\tau}$ is asymptotically normally distributed with mean
$f_{\tau}$ and variance $\tau (1 - \tau)/(n[g(f_\tau)]^2$) where
$$g(y)=y\sum_{i=1}^{n(y)}|f^{'}(z_i)|^{-1},$$
and $\{z_i\}$ denote those points in the sample space of $X$ such that
$f(z_i)=y$, $i=1, 2,\cdots,n(y)$. Figure [2](#ltauest2) (first row,
right) depicts the confidence regions obtained with package *HDiR* (in
dark red colour) for the circular model presented in Figure [1](#ltau).

### Suitable bandwidth selection for HDRs estimation {#h1}

The plug-in reconstruction of the directional HDRs in
(\@ref(eq:Ltauest)) also involves the calculation of the kernel density
estimator in (\@ref(eq:estimacionnucleo)) that is known to be heavily
dependent on the selection of $h$. Package *HDiR* implements the
proposal in [@saavedra2020nonparametric] where the first selector of $h$
specifically designed for HDRs reconstruction is presented. The idea is
to use an error criterion that quantifies the differences between the
theoretical region and its plug-in reconstruction. In the real-valued
setting, [@samworth2010asymptotics] use a similar idea in order to
propose one of the first bandwidth selectors for HDRs estimation.

The closed expression of the Hausdorff distance between the boundaries
of the HDR and its plug-in reconstruction,
$d_H(\partial L(f_\tau),\partial\hat{L}(\hat{f}_\tau))$, is not known in
the directional case. However, such a distance could be approximated
through a bootstrap procedure. With this view in mind,
[@saavedra2020nonparametric] consider a new bandwidth selector as
follows:
$$h_{*}=\arg \min_{h>0}\mathbb{E}_B\left[d_H(\partial L^{*}(\hat{f}_\tau^*),\partial \hat{L}(\hat{f}_\tau))\right],
\label{eq:h1}   (\#eq:h1)$$
where $\mathbb{E}_B$ denotes the bootstrap expectation with respect to
random samples of points $\mathcal X_n=\{X_1^*,\cdots,X_n^*\}$ generated
from the directional kernel $f_n$ that, of course, requires a pilot
bandwidth chosen for computing $\hat{L}(\hat{f}_\tau)$.

# Using *HDiR* {#sec:3}

This section presents an overview of the structure of the package.
*HDiR* ([@HDiR]) is an easy-to-use toolbox that R practitioners can use
for computation or plug-in estimation of directional highest density
regions and general level sets defined on the circle and sphere. The
methods included in the package facilitate both data exploration and
nonparametric estimation of the target regions. Functions in this
library automatize the required operations for the computation of this
kind of sets. First, we will describe the real data sets included in the
package. Then, the functions available in *HDiR* are detailed. Of
course, there exist several libraries in the CRAN repository of R
dealing with plug-in estimation of Euclidean level sets and HDRs. In
particular, the library
[*pdfCluster*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=pdfCluster)
([@azzalini2014package]) provides a routine to estimate the probability
density function by kernel methods from a set of linear data with
arbitrary dimension. The main focus is on cluster analysis via kernel
density estimation according to the approach by
[@hartigan1975clustering]. For modal clustering, package
[*LPCM*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=LPCM) ([@einbeck46lpcm])
implements the mean-shift algorithm and
[*Modalclust*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=Modalclust)
([@cheng2014parallel]) performs the method for mode seeking introduced
in [@li2007nonparametric]. There are also other packages that do not
solve the task of estimate HDRs directly, but they usually allow to
compute the linear kernel density estimator and, therefore, address HDRs
graphical representation (not necessarily with an appropriate estimate).
A brief summary of the capabilities of these libraries are provided
below.

-   [*denpro*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=denpro)
    ([@klemela2005algorithms], [@klemela2006visualization],
    [@klemela2008mode], [@klemela2009smoothing],
    [@holmstrom2017estimation] and [@klepackage]): This library allows
    to visualize multivariate densities and density estimates with level
    set trees and also to represent level sets with shape trees in
    moderate dimensional cases. Furthermore, the kernel estimator
    implemented by default could be replaced by other density estimates.
-   [*hdrcde*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=hdrcde)
    ([@hyndman2018package]): This package computes Euclidean HDRs in one
    and two dimensions. The specific HDR bandwidth selector proposed in
    [@samworth2010asymptotics] is also implemented. Confidence regions
    for one-dimensional HDRs and bivariate HDRs scatterplots (colouring
    sample points according to the region in which they fall) are also
    available.
-   [*lsbs*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=lsbs)
    ([@doss2018bandwidth]): This package implements the bandwidth
    selector for two-dimensional Euclidean level sets and HDRs proposed
    in [@doss2018bandwidth]. A plug-in strategy to estimate the
    asymptotic risk function and minimize to get the optimal bandwidth
    matrix is applied.

Other packages such as [*sm*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=sm)
([@sm]) and [*ks*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=ks)
([@duong2007ks]) also include tools for kernel density estimation
allowing for graphical displays of density contours in the two- and
three-dimensional Euclidean spaces. Moreover, there are many libraries
in the CRAN repository for directional data analysis but, as far as we
know, none of them solves the problem of level set or HDR
reconstruction. In this section, we would like to highlight those
packages including tools for kernel density estimation, both for
circular and directional data:

-   [*circular*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=circular)
    ([@agostinelli2013r]): It is an extension of the
    [*CircStats*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=CircStats) package.
    It provides functions for the statistical analysis (descriptive
    statistics, circular models, hypothesis tests), graphical
    representation and some classical circular datasets.
-   [*Directional*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=Directional)
    ([@tsagris2017package]): A collection of functions for directional
    data analysis are implemented in this library. Apart from hypothesis
    testing, discriminant and regression analysis, it allows to compute
    the kernel density estimation for hyper-spherical data using a von
    Mises-Fisher kernel.
-   [*DirStats*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=DirStats) ([@dd]):
    This library also allows to compute a kernel density estimator and,
    additionally, it implements the cross-validation and plug-in
    bandwidth selectors in [@hall1987kernel] and [@garcia2013exact],
    respectively.
-   [*NPCirc*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=NPCirc) ([@oli2014]):
    Nonparametric density and regression estimation methods for circular
    data are included in this package. Specifically, a circular kernel
    density estimation procedure is provided, jointly with different
    alternatives for choosing the smoothing parameter. Based on the
    kernel density estimator, a SiZer technique (CircSiZer) is developed
    for circular data. The package also includes functions for
    nonparametric circular regression.

Note also that there are other packages including tools for
circular/directional data analysis. For instance, *CircStats*
([@lundcircstats]) is a companion to [@jammalamadaka2001topics],
although functions implemented in this package are also available in
*circular*. [*CircNNTSR*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=CircNNTSR)
([@fernandez2013circnntsr]) provides an alternative estimation method
for circular distributions based on nonnegative trigonometric sums.
[*isocir*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=isocir)
([@barragan2013isocir]) implements some routines for analyzing angular
data subjected to order constraints on a unit circle. Finally,
[*movMF*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=movMF) ([@hornik2014movmf])
is focused on mixtures of von Mises distributions, allowing to draw
random samples from these models and to proceed with parameter
estimation, by using an expectation-maximization algorithm.

Specifically, the goal of *HDiR* package is to provide tools for
directional (circular and spherical) general level sets and HDRs exact
computation also including their plug-in estimation. This library
implements the first specific bandwidth selector devised for directional
HDRs proposed in [@saavedra2020nonparametric], but it also allows
directly user-defined bandwidth selection and to use the existing
directional bandwidth selection methods devised for kernel density
estimation. Additionally, two alternative methods for estimating the
threshold $f_\tau$ (based on the proposal in [@hyndman1996computing] and
numerical integration methods, respectively) are developed. Moreover,
confidence regions for circular HDR are also available and can be
depicted for illustration. Two exploratory tools are also implemented.
The first one is a scatterplot computed from HDRs plug-in
reconstructions. Sample points are coloured according to the directional
HDRs in which they fall. Finally, Euclidean and Hausdorff distances
between sets can be also computed. Their roles are crucial to measure
the distances between directional clusters or, for instance, to quantify
the estimation error between the theoretical HDRs and the corresponding
plug-in estimators.

  package contents.
:::

A complete description of the *HDiR* package capabilities is provided in
this section. The complete list of functions, illustrative density
models (density functions and random sample generation) and the two
novel datasets available in *HDiR*, with a brief description, can be
seen in Table [1](#tab:1).

## Data description

The package *HDiR* includes a circular and a spherical datasets, used
for the illustration of the different functions. The first dataset,
`sandhoppers`, contains the orientation angles (in radians between $0$
and $2\pi$) of two species of sandhoppers, Talitrus saltator and
Talorchestia brito. Orientation was measured under natural conditions on
the exposed nontidal sand of Zouara beach located in the Tunisian
northwestern coast. Additionally, other variables of interest for
analyzing the behavioral plasticity of both species were also
registered. For instance, information on the month, the time of the day,
the temperature, the air relative humidity or the sex of each animal is
also available. This dataset was already analyzed in
[@scapini2002multiple] and [@marchetti2003use]. Specifically, the
behavior of these two species is compared through regresion procedures.
[@scapini2002multiple] conclude that Talitrus saltator showed more
differentiated orientations, depending on the time of day, period of the
year and sex, with respect to Talorchestia brito. As an illustration,
[@saavedra2020nonparametric] also study the behavior of these two
species of sandhoppers under the HDR estimation approach.

The second dataset, `earthquakes`, contains the geographical coordinates
(latitude and longitude) of earthquakes of magnitude greater than or
equal to 2.5 degrees on the Richter scale registered on Earth between
1st October 2004 and 9th April 2020. It can be downloaded from the
website of the European-Mediterranean Seismological Centre (EMSC)[^1].
The planar points included in the dataset correspond to spherical
coordinates on Earth. Due to the important damages that earthquakes of a
certain intensity may cause, cluster detection of HDRs could be also
useful to identify, from a real dataset, where earthquakes are specially
likely. This information is crucial for decision-making, for example, to
update construction codes guaranteeing a better building
seismic-resistance. [@saavedra2020nonparametric] also analyze the recent
world earthquakes distribution through HDRs estimation from this
dataset. Results shows that the greatest mode of sample distribution is
identified in the Southeast of Europe. Countries such as Italy, Greece
or Turkey (located within this cluster) are, as expected, the most
affected areas in the analyzed period. The second dataset,
`earthquakes`, contains the geographical coordinates (latitude and
longitude) of earthquakes of magnitude greater than or equal to 2.5
degrees on the Richter scale registered on Earth between 1st October
2004 and 9th April 2020. It can be downloaded from the website of the
European-Mediterranean Seismological Centre (EMSC)[^2]. The planar
points included in the dataset correspond to spherical coordinates on
Earth. Due to the important damages that earthquakes of a certain
intensity may cause, cluster detection of HDRs could be also useful to
identify, from a real dataset, where earthquakes are specially likely.
This information is crucial for decision-making, for example, to update
construction codes guaranteeing a better building seismic-resistance.
[@saavedra2020nonparametric] also analyze the recent world earthquakes
distribution through HDRs estimation from this dataset. Results shows
that the greatest mode of sample distribution is identified in the
Southeast of Europe. Countries such as Italy, Greece or Turkey (located
within this cluster) are, as expected, the most affected areas in the
analyzed period.

## Spherical density models

Functions `dspheremix` and `rspheremix` allow to compute density
functions and to generate data from the spherical distributions
introduced in [@saavedra2020nonparametric]. These densities represent a
variety of complex structures showing multimodality and/or asymetry. Any
user of package *HDiR* could use them for simulations or even for
illustration purposes.

Function `dspheremix` computes the density function of 9 different
spherical distributions that can be written as finite mixtures of
spherical von Mises-Fisher. Function `rspheremix` is designed for random
data generation from these 9 spherical models. Both functions have an
argument called `model` which allows to specify a model (a number
between $1$ and $9$) among the ones considered in
[@saavedra2020nonparametric]. The other inputs of `dspheremix` and
`rspheremix` are `x` and `n`, respectively. `x` represents a matrix
whose rows collect to points on the unit sphere (in Cartesian
coordinates) and `n` denotes the number of observations to be randomly
generated.

Specifically, model number 9 corresponds to the spherical density shown
in Figure [1](#ltau). For instance, the evaluation of this density on
the north pole $(0,0,1)$ and the south pole $(0,0,-1)$ can be easily
obtained by:

``` r
> data <- rbind(c(1, 0, 0), c(0, 0, 1))
> dspheremix(x = data, model = 9)
[1] 0.0009079986 7.0233299246
```

Output of this example with `dspheremix` is a numeric vector containing
the density values on both poles. Additionally, $100$ random deviates
from the same model can be obtained, fixing `set.seed(1)` as in the rest
of examples throughout this work, by:

``` r
> rspheremix(n = 100, model = 9)
            [,1]         [,2]         [,3]
  [1,]  0.254793394 -0.186993591  0.948743233
  [2,]  0.227755936  0.896600223  0.379783194
  [3,] -0.227024808  0.516581111  0.825592934
  [4,]  0.125075316  0.960536966 -0.248444967
```

Output of function `rspheremix` is a matrix of dimension $n\times 3$
where each row corresponds to the Cartesian coordinates of a point
generated on the unit sphere. For this example, the output is partially
shown (only four of one hundred sample points are printed).

## Computation of HDRs and general level sets with *HDiR*

Functions `circ.hdr` and `sphere.hdr` must be considered when the
objective is to compute theoretical density level sets or HDRs from a
fully known circular and spherical density $f$, respectively. However,
they could be also used for exact computation or plug-in estimation of
general level sets when $f$ is any (circular or spherical) real-valued
function. In particular, level sets of a theoretical regression curve
could be determined.

The basic arguments of function `circ.hdr` that the user must provide
are the circular (not necessarily a density) function `f` and, depending
on the set to be computed (a level set or a HDR), `level` or `tau` must
be indicated. It is worth to mention that `level` represents the value
of $t$ in (\@ref(eq:G-t)) and `1-tau`, the probability coverage
required for HDR computation in (\@ref(eq:conjuntonivel2)). Note that
`tau` must be specified only when `f` is a density. Otherwise, fixing
the probability content of the level set makes no sense. Additionally, a
graphical display is generated with different plot arguments (`col`,
`lty`, `shrink`, $\cdots$). If no graphical representation is required,
it is enough to consider `plot.hdr=FALSE` (by default `plot.hdr=TRUE`).

If `level` is specified, the output is a list with two components:
`levelset`, a matrix where each row contains the boundaries (in radians)
of each connected component of the level set and `level`, the input
`level` or a character indicating if the level set is equal to the empty
set or the support distribution. If `tau` is provided, the output is
also a list with the next components: `hdr`, a matrix where each row
contains the boundaries (in radians) of each connected component of the
HDR; `prob.content`, probability coverage `1-tau` and `level`, threshold
of the HDR computed by numerical integration methods.

An example with the code lines in order to computing a level set (second
code line) and a HDR (third code line) for the circular density
represented in Figure [1](#ltau) is given below. This circular density
is the model 13 implemented in the package *NPCirc*. Therefore, it is
necessary to install this library before executing the following code.

``` r
> f <- function(x){return(dcircmix(x, 13))}  
> circ.hdr(f, level = 0.35)
$levelset
          [,1]      [,2]
[1,] 0.3301974 0.6698291
[2,] 2.8271189 3.1730400
[3,] 4.9089351 5.0913298
$level
[1] 0.35
> circ.hdr(f, tau = 0.5) 
$hdr
          [,1]      [,2]
[1,] 0.2232764 0.7767501
[2,] 2.7201978 3.2799611
[3,] 4.8523298 5.1479351
$prob.content
[1] 0.5
$level
[1] 0.3024789
```

From the outputs obtained, some conclusions on the number of connected
components can be extracted. HDR computed when $\tau=0.5$ has exactly
three connected components with boundaries fully detailed in the element
`hdr` of the obtained list. Density level set with threshold $0.35$ is
slightly different but the information in `levelset` also shows the
existence of three connected components.

As for function `sphere.hdr`, argument `f` is now a spherical
real-valued function. Again, `f` may not be a density. The other basic
arguments `level`, `tau` and `plot.hdr` coincide with the usage
description for function `circ.hdr`. Additionally, the user can specify
two parameters related to the estimated boundary or to the numerical
integration possibilities on the unit sphere to calculate the HDRs
threshold. In particular, `nborder` indicates the maximum number of
boundary points to be represented and `tol`, the tolerance parameter
used to determinate the boundary. Two extra parameters control the
numerical integration procedure, when required. Argument `mesh`
indicates the number of vertices on each edge of the embedded icosaedrum
(reproducing the meshes in Figure [3](#mesh)). Possible values of this
argument are 10, 20 and 40, corresponding with 2000, 8000 and 32000
triangular cells on the sphere, respectively. Quadrature formulae on the
triangles are possible with different degrees, controlled by `deg`, with
values ranging from 0 up to 6.

An example with the code lines in order to compute a level set (second
line) and a HDR (third line) for the spherical density represented in
Figure [1](#ltau) is presented in what follows:

``` r
> f <- function(x){return(dspheremix(x, model = 9))} 
> sphere.hdr(f, level = 0.1, mesh = 10, deg = 3)
> sphere.hdr(f, tau = 0.5, mesh = 10, deg = 3) 
```

Outputs are similar to those presented for function `circ.hdr`. Again,
`levelset` and `hdr` are matrices of rows of points (in Cartesian
coordinates) on the level set and HDR boundaries, respectively.
Moreover, it is worth to mention that execution time of `sphere.hdr` is
considerably higher when `tau` is set instead `level` because, in this
case, threshold estimation via numerical integration methods is
required.

## Plug-in estimation of HDRs and general level sets with *HDiR*

The *HDiR* package contains the implementation of density plug-in
methods in order to estimate HDRs. Furthermore, it also enables plug-in
estimation of general level sets.

### Basic plug-in estimation of HDRs and density level sets

Function `circ.plugin.hdr` allows to reconstruct density level sets or
HDRs from the kernel estimator described in
(\@ref(eq:estimacionnucleo)). The arguments `tau`, `level` and
`plot.hdr` have basically the same description for function `circ.hdr`.
The argument `sample` denotes a numeric vector of angles (in radians)
corresponding to the sample of points $\mathcal{X}_n$. The smoothing
parameter to be used for kernel density estimation is denoted through
`bw`. Its value could be directly established by the user. Following
[@oli2014], it could be also chosen by using the classical functions
`bw.rt`, `bw.CV`, `bw.pi` or `bw.boot` in *NPCirc* (by default
`bw=bw.CV(circular(sample))` providing a cross-validation bandwidth).
The previous options are designed for density estimation. An appropriate
bandwidth for HDR estimation can be obtained using `circ.boot.bw`. The
argument `tau.method` is a character value selecting the rule to
estimate the HDRs threshold. This must be one of `"quantile"` or
`"trapezoidal"`. The default option estimates the threshold using the
quantile method proposed in [@hyndman1996computing]; the second one,
using the trapezoidal rule for numerical integration. The confidence for
limits on HDR are established from `conf` that is a numeric probability
that takes the value `conf=0.95` by default. Finally, `plot.hdrconf` is
a logical string. If `plot.hdr=TRUE` and `plot.hdrconf=TRUE` (default
options), the confidence region for the estimated HDR is added to the
estimation graphical representation. The argument `boot` is a logical
string. If `TRUE`, confidence regions are not computed. Its name is due
to this option is only used by function `circ.boot.bw` for reducing the
execution time. Default `boot=FALSE`.

If `level` is specified, the output is a list with four components:
`levelset`, a matrix where each row contains the boundary (in radians)
of a connected component of the level set or a character indicating if
the HDR is equal to the empty set or the support distribution;
`prob.content`, the empirical probability coverage of the set; `level`
indicates the level of the level set and `bw`, the value of the
smoothing parameter. If `tau` is provided, the output is a list with the
next components: `hdr`, a matrix where each row contains the boundary
(in radians) of a connected component of the level set; `prob.content`,
the probability coverage `1-tau`; `level`, the estimated threshold;
`bw`, the numeric value of the smoothing parameter used; `hdr.lo` and
`hdr.hi`, HDRs corresponding to lower and upper confidence limits,
respectively; `threshold.lo` and `threshold.hi` the corresponding
thresholds.

For example, the circular confidence regions in Figure [2](#ltauest2)
can be obtained from the next code lines:

``` r
> sample <- rcircmix(500, 13)
> circ.plugin.hdr(sample, tau = 0.5, plot.hdrconf = TRUE, k = 2, col = "blue")
$hdr
          [,1]      [,2]
[1,] 0.1478027 0.6761185
[2,] 2.6761715 3.2736716
[3,] 4.9403824 5.1542246
$prob.content
[1] 0.5
$level
      50% 
0.2952482 
$bw

[1,] 0.1226448 0.7327238
[2,] 2.6447241 3.3114085
[3,] 4.9089351 5.1793825
$level.lo
      50% 
0.2762859 
$hdr.hi
         [,1]      [,2]
[1,] 0.179250 0.6320922
[2,] 2.713908 3.2422243
```

a cross-validation bandwidth and the specific bandwidth for spherical
HDR reconstruction (left). Estimated HDRs from a random sample of size

``` r
[3,] 4.984409 5.1164877
$level.hi
      50% 
0.3142105 
```

Specifically, `hdr.lo` and `hdr.hi` in the output list contain the
matrices whose rows correspond to the boundaries (in radians) of the
connected components of lower and upper confidence regions,
respectively. For this example, both regions have three connected
components. Additionally, `level.lo` and `level.hi` contain the
thresholds of both confidence sets.

The specific bandwidth for circular HDRs estimation described in
[@saavedra2020nonparametric] can be computed from function
`circ.boot.bw`. As in the previous circular functions described, the
argument `sample` is a numeric vector of angles (in radians)
representing $\mathcal{X}_n$ and `tau` corresponds to the probability
coverage `1-tau` of the HDR to be reconstructed. The pilot smoothing
parameter used is `bw`. Default
`bw=bw.CV(circular(sample), upper = 100)`. As before, its value could be
chosen by using the classical functions `bw.rt`, `bw.CV`, `bw.pi` or
`bw.boot` in *NPCirc*. The number of bootstrap resamples is denoted by
`B` (by default `B=50`) and `upper` is the numerical upper value for
bounding the optimization procedure (by default `1.5bw`). The output of
this function is a single numeric value corresponding to the selected
smoothing parameter.

The following code lines show how to determine both bandwidths for the
circular sample previously generated. Output shows that cross-validation
selector takes a larger value than the proposal in
[@saavedra2020nonparametric].

``` r
> bw.CV(sample, upper = 100); circ.boot.bw(sample, tau = 0.8, B = 2)
[1] 64.62809
[1] 37.06194
```

Function `sphere.plugin.hdr` is designed to estimate spherical HDRs or
density level sets from the kernel estimator described in
(\@ref(eq:estimacionnucleo)). The arguments `tau`, `level`, `plot.hdr`,
`nborder`, `tol`, `mesh` and `deg` have the same description as for
function `sphere.hdr`. The pilot smoothing parameter used is `bw` that,
by default, is `bw="none"` selecting a cross-validation bandwidth.
Although other options are possible. For instance, `bw` can be a numeric
value o also `bw="rot"` allows to consider the rule of thumb suggested
by [@garcia2013exact]. The value of `bw` could be also selected directly
by the user. The argument `ngrid` sets the resolution of the density
calculation (by default `ngrid=500`).

If `level` is provided, the output is also a list with four components:
`levelset`, a matrix of rows of points ( on the HDR boundary;
`prob.content`, the empirical probability coverage of the set `1-tau`;
`level`, the level of the HDR and `bw`, the value of the smoothing
parameter. If `tau` is an input, the output of `sphere.plugin.hdr` is a
list with the following components: `hdr`, a matrix of rows of points on
the HDR boundary; `prob.content`, probability coverage `1-tau` and
`level`, threshold or level associated to the probability content
`1-tau`. The threshold $f_{\tau}$ is computed through the algorithm
proposed in [@hyndman1996computing]. Numerical integration is not
considered here in order to reduce the computation time.

The spherical HDRs estimators in Figure [2](#ltauest2) can be reproduced
through the next code lines:

``` r
> sample <- rspheremix(500, model = 9)
> sphere.plugin.hdr(sample, tau = 0.5, nborder = 2000)
```

The first specific bandwidth for spherical HDRs estimation described in
[@saavedra2020nonparametric] can be computed from function
`sphere.boot.bw`. As in the previous spherical functions described, the
argument `sample` is a matrix whose rows represent points on the unit
sphere (in Cartesian coordinates) and `tau` corresponds to the
probability coverage `1-tau` of the HDR to be reconstructed. The pilot
smoothing parameter `bw` (default `bw="none"`) is chosen using
cross-validation, although it may be set to a numeric value or
`bw="rot"`, allowing to select the rule of thumb suggested by
[@garcia2013exact]. The argument `B` denotes again the number of
bootstrap resamples that (default `B=50`) and `upper` is the numerical
upper value for bounding the optimization procedure (default `1.5bw`).
The output of this function is a single numeric value corresponding to
the selected smoothing parameter.

The following code lines contain a simulated example where the
cross-validation bandwidth and the proposal in
[@saavedra2020nonparametric] provide HDR estimations which look quite
different for the spherical model $8$ in *HDiR*. Figure [4](#difbw)
shows the graphical representations of the theoretical HDR to be
estimated when $\tau=0.8$ (dark red colour) and the corresponding
reconstructions (bluish colours) obtained from a random sample of size
$500$. In this case, the specific bandwidth for spherical HDRs
reconstruction takes the value $0.28$ while the cross-validation
bandwidth is equal to $0.20$.

``` r
> sample <- rspheremix(500, model = 8) 
> bw.boot <- sphere.boot.bw(sample, bw = "rot", tau = 0.8, B = 2) 
> sphere.plugin.hdr(sample, bw = bw.boot, tau = 0.8) 
> sphere.plugin.hdr(sample, bw = "none", tau = 0.8)
```

Finally, it is important to note that function `sphere.plugin.hdr` for
reconstructing spherical HDR's calls `vmf.kerncontour` in package
*Directional* to compute the density on a grid on the sphere. Most of
the computational work in this function is in estimating the density
using `vmf.kerncontour`. Hence, the speed of this function depends
largely on the speed of `vmf.kerncontour`. A similar situation occurs
for function `sphere.boot.bw` where function `sphere.plugin.hdr` is
called $(B+1)$ times where $B$ indicates the number of bootstrap
resamples.

### Plug-in estimation of HDRs and density level sets from an arbitrary density estimator

Density estimators different from the one introduced in
(\@ref(eq:estimacionnucleo)) could be naturally considered for plug-in
estimation of HDRs or level sets. Functions `circ.hdr` and `sphere.hdr`
in package *HDiR* allow to consider this option in the circular and
spherical settings, respectively.

Next, an example with the code lines in order to determine a spherical
HDR plug-in reconstruction (sixth line) from the kernel density
estimator in [@bai1989kernel] with uniform kernel is shown.

``` r
> f <- function(x){
    sample <- rspheremix(500, model = 3)
    return(kde_dir(x, data = sample, h = 0.4,
     L = function(x) dunif(x)))
    }
> sphere.hdr(f, level = 0.3)
$levelset
                [,1]         [,2]      [,3]
  [1,]  0.3587511132 -0.159961736 0.9196249
  [2,] -0.4523490796  0.077542650 0.8884635
  [3,] -0.4588831000  0.060463844 0.8864369
  [4,]  0.2455354599 -0.291602658 0.9244892
$level
[1] 0.3
```

An spherical density estimator with uniform kernel is available in
package *DirStats*. Before level set plug-in estimation, it is necessary
to install this library in order to define the kernel estimator, in this
example, from a sample of size $500$ of model 3 in *HDiR* (lines from 1
to 5). The output contains a matrix of points on the boundary of the
plug-in estimator in `levelset`. Note that only the first four points
are printed in the example. The value of the threshold $0.3$ considered
for reconstruction is also shown in `level`.

Furthermore, if the considered density estimator for plug-in estimation
is also a density function, argument `tau` in `circ.hdr` and
`sphere.hdr` could be used.

### Plug-in estimation of general level sets

A generalisation of the approach in [@cuevas2006plug], for general level
sets, to the directional setting can be performed in practice with
*HDiR*. Again, functions `circ.hdr` and `sphere.hdr` address this
problem for circular and sperical data, respectively.

Next, an example with the code lines in order to obtain the plug-in
estimator of a regression curve (eighth line) with circular explanatory
(`x`) variable and linear response (`y`). In this case, the regression
curve is estimated through the Nadaraya-Watson estimator implemented in
*NPCirc*. Here, it is computed from a sample of size $100$ of variables
`x` and `y` (lines from 1 to 7).

``` r
> f <- function(t){

## Exploring data with *HDiR* {#exploratory}

This section introduces a brief background on the design of two
exploratory tools included in *HDiR*: distances between sets and
circular/spherical scatterplots.

![Figure 5: In the first column, the black dotted line represents the
Hausdorff distance between $\partial L(f_\tau)$ (blue colour) and
$\partial \hat{L}(\hat{f}_{\tau})$ (red colour) for the circular density
shown in Figure [1](#ltau) when $\tau=0.5$. In the second and third
columns, scatterplots showing $\hat{L}(\hat{f}_{\tau_i})$ ($i=1,2,3$)
for the circular and spherical densities contained in Figure [1](#ltau)
when $\tau_1=0.2$, $\tau_2=0.5$ and $\tau_3=0.8$. The circular
scatterplot was computed from $\mathcal{X}_{100}$ and the spherical
scatterplot from $\mathcal{X}_{1000}$. ](scaterplot.png){#scaterplot

Distances between sets are a useful tool when the target is the
reconstruction of a set. In particular, the Hausdorff distance can be
seen as a suitable error criterion also in the directional setting.
Additionally, it could be also used for measuring the distances between
modes or clusters of two different populations. Figure [5](#scaterplot)
(first column) represents, through a black dashed line, the Hausdorff
distance between $\partial L(f_\tau)$ (blue colour) and
$\partial \hat{L}(\hat{f}_{\tau})$ (red colour) for the circular density
shown in Figure [1](#ltau) when $\tau=0.5$. Note that the maximum value
of this error criterion is $2$, the diameter of the unit circle. In this
example, the Hausdorff estimation error that is equal to $1.38$ is
remarkably high.

Function `circ.distances` computes the Euclidean and Hausdorff distances
between two sets of points in $S^1$. Its inputs are `x` and `y`, two
numeric vectors of angles (in radians) determining both sets of points.
The output is a list with two components: `dE`, a numeric value
corresponding to the Euclidean distance, and `dH`, another numeric value
corresponding to the Hausdorff distance.

Specifically, if `x` and `y` correspond to two HDRs boundaries, this
function returns the distances between the circular HDRs frontiers. In
particular, for the example in Figure [5](#scaterplot) (left), the
distances between $\partial L(\tau)$ and
$\partial \hat{L}(\hat{f}_{\tau})$ can be computed from the next code
lines:

``` r
> sample <- rcircmix(100, 13)	
> f <- function(x){return(dcircmix(x, 13))}
> circ.distances(as.numeric(circ.hdr(f, tau = 0.5)$hdr),
    + as.numeric(circ.plugin.hdr(sample, tau = 0.5)$hdr))
$dE
[1] 0.04402277
$dH
[1] 1.37933
```

The results obtained show that the Euclidean distance is considerably
smaller than the Hausdorff distance that, as we mention before, takes
the value $1.38$.

Function `sphere.distances` also determines the Euclidean and Hausdorff
distances but, in this case, between two sets of points on $S^2$. Now,
the inputs `x` and `y` are two matrices whose rows represent points on
the unit sphere (in Cartesian coordinates). The output of this function
has the same organization as the output of `circ.distances` and it also
allows to compute distances between spherical HDRs frontiers.

Distances between $\partial \hat{L}(\hat{f}_{\tau_2})$ and
$\partial \hat{L}(\hat{f}_{\tau_3})$ represented in Figure
[5](#scaterplot) (right) can be computed from the next code lines:

``` r
> sample = rspheremix(1000, model = 9)
> x <- sphere.plugin.hdr(sample, tau = 0.8, plot.hdr = FALSE)$hdr
> y <- sphere.plugin.hdr(sample, tau = 0.5, plot.hdr = FALSE)$hdr
> sphere.distances(x, y)
$dE
[1] 0.08600028
$dH
[1] 0.258705
```

The performance of the specific bandwidth for HDR estimation introduced
in [@saavedra2020nonparametric] can be also illustrated through the
consideration of the Hausdorff distance in the example shown in Figure
[4](#difbw). Specifically, the value of the Hausdorff distance between
the theoretical HDR and the reconstruction computed from the bandwidth
proposed in [@saavedra2020nonparametric] is $0.20$. However, the
Hausdorff distance increases considerably, taking the value $0.36$, when
it measures the discrepancies between the theoretical HDR and the
corresponding estimator obtained from a cross-validation approach.

Additionally, scatterplots are useful to identify the estimated
directional HDRs in which sample points fall. This graphical tool is
computed as follows. Given several values
$\tau_1,\cdots,\tau_k\in (0,1)$ ($k\geq 1$) and a random sample of
points $\mathcal{X}_n$, the estimated HDRs
$\hat{L}(\hat{f}_{\tau_1}),\cdots,\hat{L}(\hat{f}_{\tau_k})$ are
represented using different colours jointly with the subset of sample
points belonging to each of them. Figure [5](#scaterplot) (second and
third columns) displays the scatterplots for $\tau_1=0.2$, $\tau_2=0.5$
and $\tau_3=0.8$ for the circular and the spherical densities shown in
Figure [1](#ltau). They were calculated from random samples of sizes
$n=100$ and $n=1000$, respectively.

Function `circ.scatterplot` produces a circular scatterplot with points
coloured according to the HDRs in which they fall. Apart from the
argument `tau` that represents a numeric vector of probabilities and
`plot.density` that is a logical string indicating if the kernel density
estimator is added to the scatterplot (default `plot.density=TRUE`), the
other inputs (`sample`, `bw` and `tau.method`) have the same description
for circular functions. The output is a scatterplot and also a list
where the number of components is equal to the number of estimated HDR
or, equivalently, to the length of `tau` vector. Each component contains
the sample points in each HDR from the smallest value of `tau` to the
largest one.

Next code lines allow to obtain a circular scatterplot computed from a
circular sample of size $100$ as the shown in Figure [5](#scaterplot)
(second column).

``` r
> sample<- rcircmix(100, model = 13)
> circ.scatterplot(sample, tau = c(0.2, 0.5, 0.8))
```

Spherical scatterplots can be represented from function
`sphere.scatterplot`. Again, apart from `tau` that is a vector of
probabilities, the description of the remaining parameters coincides
with the rest of spherical functions. The output provides a scatterplot
and, as in the circular case, a list where the number of components is
equal to the number of estimated HDR containing the corresponding sample
points from the smallest value of `tau` to the biggest one.

As an illustration, the spherical scatterplot shown in Figure
[5](#scaterplot) (third column) could be computed from the next code
lines:

``` r
> sample <- rspheremix(1000, model = 9) 
> sphere.scatterplot(sample, tau = c(0.2, 0.5, 0.8))
```

## Real data analysis with *HDiR* {#exploratorydatasets}

Datasets `sandhoppers` and `earthquakes` included in *HDiR* are used
next to illustrate briefly the usage of the set of functions previously
described in the circular and spherical settings, respectively.

Figure [6](#hdrsand) shows the estimated HDRs established in
(\@ref(eq:Ltauest)), when $\tau=0.8$, for female (left) and male
sandhoppers (right) of the species Talorchestia Brito when the
orientation is registered in the morning during October. The largest
modes of both distributions are located in completely different
directions, indicating that variable sex is a factor with influence on
the sandhoppers behavior. The code lines used are presented:

``` r
> data(sandhoppers)
> attach(sandhoppers)
> britoF <- angle[(species == "brito")&(time == "morning")&(sex == "F")
	+ &(month == "October")]
> circ.plugin.hdr(sample = britoF, tau = 0.8, plot.hdrconf = FALSE) 
> britoM <- angle[(species == "brito")&(time == "morning")&(sex == "M")
    + &(month == "October")]
> circ.plugin.hdr(sample = britoM, tau = 0.8, plot.hdrconf = FALSE)
```

According to Figure [6](#hdrsand), no remarkable differences exist
between the HDRs reconstructions for males using a cross-validation
bandwidth (center) and the proposal $h_*$ in
[@saavedra2020nonparametric] (right). However, these smoothing
parameters are quite different, taking values $33.86$ and $19.47$,
respectively. For the subset of females, differences between smoothing
parameters are smaller ($5.78$ and $3.39$, respectively). Next, code
lines show how to determine both bandwidths for the group of males (fist
line) and females (second line).

``` r
> bw.CV(britoM); circ.boot.bw(britoM, tau = 0.8)
> bw.CV(britoF); circ.boot.bw(britoF, tau = 0.8)
```

![Figure 6: Plug-in estimations of HDRs (gray colour) with
cross-validation bandwidth, when $\tau=0.8$, for females (left) and
males (center) of the species Talorchestia Brito when the orientation is
registered in morning during October. Plug-in estimation of HDR (gray
colour) with specific bandwidth $h_*$, when $\tau=0.8$, for males
(right) of the species Talorchestia Brito when the orientation is
registered in morning during October.](hdrsand.png){#hdrsand
width="100%" alt="graphic without alt text"}

As an example with the dataset `earthquakes` in Figure [7](#earth), we
show the estimated HDR defined in (\@ref(eq:Ltauest)) for $\tau=0.8$.
The largest mode of the earthquakes distribution is located in Southeast
Europe. Note that it is necessary to install the packages *Directional*,
[*ggplot2*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=ggplot2),
[*maps*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=maps) and
[*mapproj*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=mapproj) previously to
obtain this figure.

``` r
> data(earthquakes)
> hdr <- as.data.frame(euclid.inv(sphere.plugin.hdr(euclid(earthquakes), tau = 0.8, 
	+ plot.hdr = FALSE)$hdr))
> world <- map_data("world")
> g.earthquakes <- ggplot()+
> geom_map(data = world, map = world, mapping = aes(map_id = region),
	+  color = "grey90", fill = "grey80")+
> geom_point(data = earthquakes, mapping = aes(x = Longitude, 
	+   y = Latitude), color = "red", alpha = 0.2, size = 0.75, stroke = 0)+
> geom_point(data = hdr, mapping = aes(x = Long, y = Lat), 
	+  	color = "darkblue", size = 1)+
> scale_y_continuous(breaks = NULL, limits = c(-90, 90))+
> scale_x_continuous(breaks = NULL, limits = c(-180, 180))+
> coord_map("mercator")
> g.earthquakes
```

The value of the bandwidth proposed in [@saavedra2020nonparametric] for
`earthquakes` dataset with `tau=0.8` and `B=5` bootstrap resamples is
$0.09$ and it can be obtained from the next code line. In this
particular case, Figure [7](#earth) shows that there is not a large
differences between the HDRs reconstructed from cross-validation
bandwidth (left) and the proposal in [@saavedra2020nonparametric]
(right).

``` r
> sphere.boot.bw(euclid(earthquakes), tau = 0.8, B = 5)
```

Once the HDRs estimation has been performed for different values of
$\tau$, Euclidean and Hausdorff distances between the blue and red
contours in Figure [7](#earth) are useful to analyse differences between
them. For the previous example, distances can be computed from the
following code lines. Note that the value of the bandwidth in
[@saavedra2020nonparametric] has been directly inserted as an argument
in the fourth line. Values obtained for Euclidean and Hausdorff
distances are $0$ and $0.02$, respectively.

``` r
> hdr1 <- sphere.plugin.hdr(euclid(earthquakes), tau = 0.8, plot.hdr = FALSE)$hdr
> hdr2 <- sphere.plugin.hdr(euclid(earthquakes), bw = 0.09, tau = 0.8,
	+ plot.hdr = FALSE)$hdr
> sphere.distances(hdr1, hdr2)
```

![Figure 7: Contours of plug-in HDRs for $\tau=0.8$ obtained from the
sample of world earthquakes registered between October 2004 and April
2020 with cross-validation bandwidth (left) and with the specific
bandwidth for spherical HDRs reconstruction (right).](earth.png){#earth
width="100%" alt="graphic without alt text"}

Apart from distances between HDRs, scatterplots are another powerful
exploratory tool implemented in *HDiR*. For the `sandhoppers` dataset,
Figure [8](#scatter2) shows the circular scatterplots for $\tau=0.2$,
$0.5$ and $0.8$ for females (left) and males (center) of the species
Talorchestia Brito when the orientation is registered in the morning
during October when $\tau=0.2$, $0.5$ and $0.8$. They can be obtained
from the following code:

``` r
> circ.scatterplot(britoF, tau = c(0.2, 0.5, 0.8)) 
> circ.scatterplot(britoM, tau = c(0.2, 0.5, 0.8))
```

Spherical scatterplots for `earthquakes` dataset when $\tau=0.2$,
$\tau=0.5$ and $\tau=0.8$ can be computed from the following code line.
The function `euclid` allows to transforms the data to geographical
coordinates (longitude and latitude) on Cartesian coordinates. Remark
that the smoothing parameter is selected by using the rule of thumb
proposed in [@garcia2013exact].

``` r
>  sphere.scatterplot(euclid(earthquakes), tau = c(0.2, 0.5, 0.8), bw = "rot", 
    + nborder = 1500)
```

# Discussion {#sec:4}

*HDiR* has been mainly developed for facilitating the reconstruction of
directional (circular and spherical) HDRs and density level sets,
following a nonparametric plug-in approach. However, it also allows to
solve the computation and the plug-in estimation of level sets for
general real-valued functions, such as a regression curve. As
consequence, plug-in reconstruction of HDRs could be performed by
considering a different density estimator than the one implemented by
default in *HDiR*.

The implemented tools are accessible for the scientific community,
enabling their usage in practical problems such as the exploration of
modes or the approximation of the distribution *effective support*. As
previously noted, level set computation is also useful for determining
distribution clusters, a task that can be accomplished by the
identification of the connected components from a plug-in level set
estimator.

Up to the authors' knowledge, *HDiR* is the only statistical package
that allows to estimate (circular and spherical) HDRs and general level
sets. For HDRs reconstruction, *HDiR* also implements the first specific
selector for HDRs estimation in this context, proposed in
[@saavedra2020nonparametric]. Additionally, it offers graphical
exploratory tools such as HDRs scatterplots that allow to visualize HDRs
of a distribution taking into account different probability contents.
Similarities or discrepancies between them could be measured through the
Hausdorff distance also implemented in *HDiR*.

Future extensions of the *HDiR* package could include the estimation of
level sets and HDRs in other supports, involving a circular or a
spherical component, such as the torus or the cylinder. In addition, new
specific bandwidths for HDR estimation could be implemented. A variety
of bandwidths selectors emerge from the consideration of different
distances in (\@ref(eq:h1)). Finally, cluster definition in
[@hartigan1975clustering] deserves to be exploited in the directional
setting, for instance, by implementing cluster trees for hyperspherical
data.
