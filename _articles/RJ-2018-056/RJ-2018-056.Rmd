title: 'Snowboot: Bootstrap Methods for Network Inference'
abstract: Complex networks are used to describe a broad range of disparate social
  systems and natural phenomena, from power grids to customer segmentation to human
  brain connectome. Challenges of parametric model specification and validation inspire
  a search for more data-driven and flexible nonparametric approaches for inference
  of complex networks. In this paper we discuss methodology and R implementation of
  two bootstrap procedures on random networks, that is, patchwork bootstrap of Thompson
  et al. (2016) and Gel et al. (2017) and vertex bootstrap of Snijders and Borgatti
  (1999). To our knowledge, the new R package snowboot is the first implementation
  of the vertex and patchwork bootstrap inference on networks in R. Our new package
  is accompanied with a detailed userâ€™s manual, and is compatible with the popular
  R package on network studies igraph. We evaluate the patchwork bootstrap and vertex
  bootstrap with extensive simulation studies and illustrate their utility in an application
  to analysis of real world networks.
