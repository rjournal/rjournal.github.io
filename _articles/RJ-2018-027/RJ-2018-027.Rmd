title: Semiparametric Generalized Linear Models with the gldrm Package
abstract: This paper introduces a new algorithm to estimate and perform inferences
  on a recently proposed and developed semiparametric generalized linear model (glm).
  Rather than selecting a particular parametric exponential family model, such as
  the Poisson distribution, this semiparametric glm assumes that the response is drawn
  from the more general exponential tilt family. The regression coefficients and unspecified
  reference distribution are estimated by maximizing a semiparametric like lihood.
  The new algorithm incorporates several computational stability and efficiency improvements
  over the algorithm originally proposed. In particular, the new algorithm performs
  well for either small or large support for the nonparametric response distribution.
  The algorithm is implemented in a new R package called gldrm.
