title: Simulating Noisy, Nonparametric, and Multivariate Discrete Patterns
abstract: Requiring no analytical forms, nonparametric discrete patterns are flexible
  in representing complex relationships among random variables. This makes them increasingly
  useful for data-driven applications. However, there appears to be no software tools
  for simulating nonparametric discrete patterns, which prevents objective evaluation
  of statistical methods that discover discrete relationships from data. We present
  a simulator to generate nonparametric discrete functions as contingency tables.
  User can request strictly many-to-one functional patterns. The simulator can also
  produce contingency tables representing dependent non-functional and independent
  relationships. An option is provided to apply random noise to contingency tables.
  We demonstrate the utility of the simulator by showing the advantage of the FunChisq
  test over Pearsonâ€™s chi-square test in detecting functional patterns. This simulator,
  implemented in the function simulate_tables in the R package FunChisq (version 2.4.0
  or greater), offers an important means to evaluate the performance of nonparametric
  statistical pattern discovery methods.
