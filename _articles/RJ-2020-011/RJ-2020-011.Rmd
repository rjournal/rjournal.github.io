title: Tools for Analyzing R Code the Tidy Way
abstract: 'With the current emphasis on reproducibility and replicability, there is
  an increasing need to examine how data analyses are conducted. In order to analyze
  the between researcher variability in data analysis choices as well as the aspects
  within the data analysis pipeline that contribute to the variability in results,
  we have created two R packages: matahari and tidycode. These packages build on methods
  created for natural language processing; rather than allowing for the processing
  of natural language, we focus on R code as the substrate of interest. The matahari
  package facilitates the logging of everything that is typed in the R console or
  in an R script in a tidy data frame. The tidycode package contains tools to allow
  for analyzing R calls in a tidy manner. We demonstrate the utility of these packages
  as well as walk through two examples.'
