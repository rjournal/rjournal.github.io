title: 'oligoMask: A Framework for Assessing and Removing the Effect of Genetic Variants
  on Microarray Probes'
abstract: As expression microarrays are typically designed relative to a reference
  genome, any individual genetic variant that overlaps a probe's genomic position
  can possibly cause a reduction in hybridization due to the probe no longer being
  a perfect match to a given sample's mRNA at that locus. If the samples or groups
  used in a microarray study differ in terms of genetic variants, the results of the
  microarray experiment can be negatively impacted. The *oligoMask* package is an
  R/SQLite framework which can utilize publicly available genetic variants and works
  in conjunction with the *oligo* package to read in the expression data and remove
  microarray probes which are likely to impact a given microarray experiment prior
  to analysis. Tools are provided for creating an SQLite database containing the probe
  and variant annotations and for performing the commonly used RMA preprocessing procedure
  for Affymetrix microarrays. The *oligoMask* package is freely available at <https://github.com/dbottomly/oligoMask>.

# Introduction

It has been observed that for mRNA microarrays from a given sample,
genetic differences of that sample relative to the probe sequences can
affect hybridization to short oligonucleotide probes resulting in false
positives or negatives depending on the experimental and array design
[@Walter:2007; @Alberts:2007]. Several approaches currently exist to
identify and flag/remove probes that have hybridization artifacts due to
genetic variants. Removal of probes based on pre-defined genetic variant
databases is one such approach [@Benovoy:2008]. Software [@Kumari:2007]
and databases [@Duan:2008] allowing the interrogation of the
relationships between microarray probes and single nucleotide variants
have been described. The R package *CustomCDF* [@Dai:2005] is an example
of this approach that removes probes from an environment formed from the
Affymetrix chip description file (CDF) prior to analysis. One potential
limitation of the CDF filtering approach is that for some of the more
recent arrays platforms such as the Affymetrix Gene or Exon arrays the
use of such environments has been superseded (e.g.Â the SQLite databases
in the
[*oligo*](https://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/oligo.html)
[@Benilton:2010] package or ROOT scheme files as in the
[*xps*](https://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/xps.html)
[@Stratowa:2014] package).

In addition, the actual expression data itself can be interrogated to
identify and mask out variants. R packages exist to effectively deal
with a two group comparison between several strains or species through
procedures based mainly on the expression data such as
[*maskBAD*](https://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/maskBAD.html)
[@Dannemann:2012] and *SNEP* [@Fujisawa:2009]. However, models based on
two (genetic) groups have limited utility when analyzing more
complicated experimental designs such as those found in expression-based
analyses using more genetically diverse mouse lines such as Diversity
Outbred [@Svenson:2012], Collaborative Cross [@Consortium:2012] or other
Heterogenous Stock [@Chia:2005] mice.

In order to facilitate eQTL mapping and other expression analyses in
complex mouse crosses we devised an R package *oligoMask* based on the
use of high quality publicly available genetic variant databases to
screen microarray probes identifying probes impacted by variants. The
key to this is the relatively recent availability of genome-wide variant
databases in the variant call format (VCF) such as those from the Sanger
Mouse Genomes Project [@Keane:2011] and the 1000 Genomes for humans
[@KG:2012] as well as the ability to query and parse these files via the
[*VariantAnnotation*](https://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/VariantAnnotation.html)
[@Obenchain:2013] package. The *oligoMask* package is designed to work
in conjunction with the *oligo* Bioconductor package to facilitate
removal of aberrant probe expression prior to the commonly used robust
multi-array average (RMA) [@Irizarry:2003] pre-processing procedure for
Affymetrix arrays. Our package works by removing potentially impacted
probes from the overall expression matrix prior to the call to the RMA
processing functions. This can be done before the background correction
step or after the normalization step. The annotation for these impacted
probes are most easily derived from VCF files with the parsed data
stored in an SQLite database. This database can be optionally wrapped in
an R package with appropriate metadata to facilitate sharing and
reproducibility. High-level S4 classes and methods provide a convenient
interface with *oligoMask* and *oligo*. In addition, users can define
new database schemas, add custom data as well as create their own
functionality. Below we give an overview as well as demonstrate using
publicly available data the steps involved for the use of *oligoMask*.

# Example data

The example data presented in this article and in the vignette was
downloaded from the gene expression omnibus (GEO) with accession number
GSE33822 [@Sun:2012]. For demonstration purposes we use a subset (n=8)
of the dataset including only those samples derived from whole brain
which received the vehicle treatment and that were run on version 1 of
the Mouse Gene ST array. In our example, we are looking for expression
differences between the NOD/ShiLtJ (NOD) inbred strain and the C57BL/6J
(B6) inbred strain, the genome of which serves as the mouse reference
genome. As we can expect the microarray probe sequences to be heavily
biased towards the reference genome, looking for differential expression
between these two strains may be problematic as differences in
expression may be due to hybridization artifacts or true gene expression
differences. First we create a NOD-specific database and then filter out
those probes that are impacted by at least one variant in the NOD strain
but not in the B6 strain and then carry out the differential expression
analysis as per standard statistical workflows.

# Workflow

## Creating a variant database

The first step in the use of *oligoMask* is the creation of an SQLite
database containing the probe annotation (including alignments to a
given genome), variant annotation and the overlap,if any, between probes
and variants. In a general sense, the probes sequences are first
realigned to the given genome using the
[*BSgenome*](https://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/BSgenome.html)
and
[*Biostrings*](https://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/Biostrings.html)
Bioconductor packages [@Pages:2013a; @Pages:2013b] with the probe
location and mappability of the probes being recorded. The locations of
the uniquely mapping probes are then used to compute overlap with the
variants in the specified VCF file using import and overlap
functionality in the *VariantAnnotation* package. The locations of the
variants in the genome, type of variant and the individual/population it
was observed in is also recorded along with the overlap between probe
alignments and variants. A convenience function for database creation is
provided (`create.sanger.mouse.vcf.db`) for use with the case of
variants derived from VCF files from the Sanger Mouse Genomes Project
and variants of the Affymetrix Mouse Gene ST arrays. The *oligoMask*
Vignette demonstrates in the section 'Data preparation' how the NOD
variant database package (*om.NOD.mogene.1.0.st*) can be created using
this function.

Additional array platforms and variant genotype file types can be
supported through a modification of `create.sanger.mouse.vcf.db` as well
as specifying the database schema as a `"TableSchemaList"` object as
returned in the pre-defined `SangerTableSchemaList` function. The
`"TableSchemaList"` S4 class serves a similar role as an
object-relational mapping approach (ORM) in other languages and allows
the R code to interact with a given database in a general way.

## Masking procedure

The masking procedure first requires the installation of the *oligo*
package along with the appropriate platform design databases that can be
downloaded from Bioconductor. In our use case of Affymetrix Gene ST
arrays, the CEL files are first read in using the `read.celfiles`
function of *oligo* resulting in a `"GeneFeatureSet"` object. Next, the
*oligoMask* database package is loaded, the parameters for the masking
procedure are defined and finally the RMA summarization is performed as
is shown below starting from the `"GeneFeatureSet"` object distributed
with *oligoMaskData*.

``` r
library(oligoMask)
library(oligoMaskData)
library(om.NOD.mogene.1.0.st)
library(pd.mogene.1.0.st.v1)
library(limma)
data(oligoMaskData)

var.parms <- VariantMaskParams(om.NOD.mogene.1.0.st, geno.filter = FALSE, 
  rm.unmap = FALSE, rm.mult = FALSE)

sun.gfs.mask <- maskRMA(oligoMaskData, target = "core", apply.mask = TRUE, 
  mask.params = var.parms)
```

The result of these commands is a summarized `"GeneFeatureSet"` object
with all probes overlapping variants from the NOD inbred strain of mouse
removed prior to the background correction step of RMA. Users can
control several aspects of the masking procedure through creation of a
parameter object. For instance users can additionally remove probes that
map to multiple locations as well as those that do not map at all to the
reference genome by supplying `TRUE` to `rm.multi` and/or `rm.unmap`.
Similarly, masking can be performed using only those variants that
passed quality filters encoded in the VCF file by setting `geno.filter`
to `TRUE`.

The `maskRMA` method carries out the RMA procedure and provides a
similar interface to the `rma` method from *oligo*. In addition it
requires specification of a `"VariantMaskParams"` object and whether the
masking procedure should be performed before the background correction
function or after background correction and normalization but before
summarization by setting the `mask.type` argument to `before.rma` or
`before.summary` respectively.

## Assessment of masking procedure

As a demonstration of *oligoMask* next we perform a basic linear-model
based differential expression analysis with the Sun *et al.* 2012 data
comparing results with and without the NOD mask applied. Below we
illustrate the basic approach using the masked data.

``` r
sun.exprs.mask <- exprs(sun.gfs.mask)
phen.dta <- data.frame(t(sapply(strsplit(colnames(sun.exprs.mask), "_"), c))[, 1:3])
names(phen.dta) <- c("tissue", "strain", "exposure")
use.mod <- model.matrix(~strain, data = phen.dta)
fit <- lmFit(sun.exprs.mask, use.mod)
fit <- eBayes(fit)
sun.exprs.mask.res <- decideTests(fit)
```

We then repeat this procedure but this time setting `apply.mask = FALSE`
in `maskRMA` to provide the baseline standard RMA values for the
comparison.

``` r
sun.gfs.unmask <- maskRMA(oligoMaskData, target = "core", apply.mask = FALSE, 
 	mask.params = var.parms)
	
sun.exprs.unmask <- exprs(sun.gfs.unmask)
um.phen.dta <- 
    data.frame(t(sapply(strsplit(colnames(sun.exprs.unmask), "_"), c))[, 1:3])
names(um.phen.dta) <- c("tissue" , "strain" , "exposure")
um.mod <- model.matrix(~strain , data = um.phen.dta)
um.fit <- lmFit(sun.exprs.unmask , um.mod)
um.fit <- eBayes(um.fit)
sun.exprs.unmask.res <- decideTests(um.fit)
```

Finally we produce a summary venn diagram of the results.

``` r
comb.mat <- cbind(sun.exprs.unmask.res[ , "strainNOD", drop = FALSE], Masked = 0)
comb.mat[rownames(sun.exprs.mask.res), "Masked"] <- 
  sun.exprs.mask.res[, "strainNOD"]
colnames(comb.mat)[1] <- "UnMasked"
vennDiagram(vennCounts(comb.mat))
```

The Venn diagram provides a visual comparison between the masked and
unmasked results, allowing the user to assess impact of variants on
expression (Figure [1](#figure:Figure1)). An executable version of this
code is provided in the accompanying vignette accessed by:

``` r
Stangle(system.file("doc/oligoMask.Rnw" , package = "oligoMask"))
```

# Conclusion

*oligoMask* is a flexible R/SQLite framework for pre-processing and
QA/QC of hybridization based expression data. Not only can it remove the
effect of spurious probe intensities due to genetic variants but it can
additionally correct for design artifacts (probes mapping to multiple
places or not mapping at all). It utilizes SQLite and works in
conjunction with the *oligo* Bioconductor package. Currently it supports
the Affymetrix Mouse Gene ST array though support could be easily added
for other array types or species as described above. Approaches for
removal of probes based off of the variant and mapping information in
the SQLite database are already implemented. More sophisticated
algorithms could be built on top of the database to provide masking
additionally based off of the expression data itself or inferred
haplotypes. We are currently working on allowing the masking to be
further controlled by enforcing positional constraints on the variants
relative to the probes as well as enabling masking to be based solely on
the mapping information. Source code is freely available to all users
from <https://github.com/dbottomly/oligoMask>. Note that
*om.NOD.mogene.1.0.st* and *oligoMaskData* are available as part of
release 0.99.08 on github
(<https://github.com/dbottomly/oligoMask/releases>).
