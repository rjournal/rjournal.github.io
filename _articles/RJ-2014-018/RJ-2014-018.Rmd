title: 'oligoMask: A Framework for Assessing and Removing the Effect of Genetic Variants
  on Microarray Probes'
abstract: As expression microarrays are typically designed relative to a reference
  genome, any individual genetic variant that overlaps a probe’s genomic position
  can possibly cause a reduction in hybridization due to the probe no longer being
  a perfect match to a given sample’s mRNA at that locus. If the samples or groups
  used in a microarray study differ in terms of genetic variants, the results of the
  microarray experiment can be negatively impacted. The oligoMask package is an R/SQLite
  framework which can utilize publicly available genetic variants and works in conjunction
  with the oligo package to read in the expression data and remove microarray probes
  which are likely to impact a given microarray experiment prior to analysis. Tools
  are provided for creating an SQLite database containing the probe and variant annotations
  and for performing the commonly used RMA preprocessing procedure for Affymetrix
  microarrays. The oligoMask package is freely available at https://github.com/dbottomly/oligoMask.
