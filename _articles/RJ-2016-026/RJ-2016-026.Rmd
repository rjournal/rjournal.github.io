title: R Packages to Aid in Handling Web Access Logs
abstract: Web access logs contain information on HTTP(S) requests and form a key part
  of both industry and academic explorations of human behaviour on the internet. But
  the preparation (reading, parsing and manipulation) of that data is just unique
  enough to make generalized tools unfit for the task, both in programming time and
  processing time which are compounded when dealing with large data sets common with
  web access logs. In this paper we explain and demonstrate a series of packages designed
  to efficiently read in, parse and munge access log data, allowing researchers to
  handle URLs and IP addresses easily. These packages are substantially faster than
  existing R methods from a 3-500% speedup for file reading to a 57,000% speedup in
  URL parsing.
