title: 'qmethod: A Package to Explore Human Perspectives Using Q Methodology'
abstract: 'Q is a methodology to explore the distinct subjective perspectives that
  exist within a group. It is used increasingly across disciplines. The methodology
  is semi-qualitative and the data are analysed using data reduction methods to discern
  the existing patterns of thought. This package is the first to perform Q analysis
  in R, and it provides many advantages to the existing software: namely, it is fully
  cross-platform, the algorithms can be transparently examined, it provides results
  in a clearly structured and tabulated form ready for further exploration and modelling,
  it produces a graphical summary of the results, and it generates a more concise
  report of the distinguishing and consensus statements. This paper introduces the
  methodology and explains how to use the package, its advantages as well as its limitations.
  I illustrate the main functions with a dataset on value patterns about democracy.'
