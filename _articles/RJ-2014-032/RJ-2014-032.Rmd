title: 'qmethod: A Package to Explore Human Perspectives Using Q Methodology'
abstract: 'Q is a methodology to explore the distinct subjective perspectives that
  exist within a group. It is used increasingly across disciplines. The methodology
  is semi-qualitative and the data are analysed using data reduction methods to discern
  the existing patterns of thought. This package is the first to perform Q analysis
  in R, and it provides many advantages to the existing software: namely, it is fully
  cross-platform, the algorithms can be transparently examined, it provides results
  in a clearly structured and tabulated form ready for further exploration and modelling,
  it produces a graphical summary of the results, and it generates a more concise
  report of the distinguishing and consensus statements. This paper introduces the
  methodology and explains how to use the package, its advantages as well as its limitations.

# Introduction

Identifying the different perspectives on or attitudes towards topics of
public concern is an important research objective in fields spanning
social [e.g., @Zografos2007], environmental [e.g., @Sandbrook2011] and
health sciences [e.g., @Thompson2001]. Q is a clearly structured,
systematic, and increasingly-used methodology designed specifically for
these purposes [@Watts2012; @Barry1999]. It is aimed at exploring the
distinct perspectives, discourses, or decision-making styles within a
group in order to address practical matters such as the acceptance of
new policies and technology or increasing public participation. The
method can be used, for example, to identify student learning styles,
farmer attitudes towards natural conservation [e.g.,
@Davies2012; @Brodt2006], user views on technology innovation
[@PetitditDariel2013], transportation habits [@VanExel2011], citizen
identities [@Davis1999], heterogeneous concepts of love [@Watts2005], or
leadership styles in business.

In essence, the data collected in Q methodology (also known as *Q
technique* or *Q-sort*) consist of a set of items (usually statements)
sorted in a specific arrangement. These statements represent all
possible opinions, which each respondent sorts in order to express their
views (usually from *most agree* to *most disagree*).[^1] The analytical
process reduces the data based on principal components analysis (PCA) or
factor analysis (FA). However, instead of correlating variables (as in
regular PCA and FA), in Q the respondents are correlated in order to
elucidate the relationships between them. The standard data reduction
method is followed by a set of analytical steps specific to Q
methodology. The final results consist of a small number of sets of
sorted statements (typically called the factors), which are different
from each other and summarise the perspectives existing among the
respondents. These results can be used for further research: to model
the relation between perspectives and other variables, to develop a
quick test to identify perspectives in larger populations, or to
understand the evolution of perspectives over time.

The analysis for Q methodology requires multiple matrix algebra
operations which have been described in detail [see Chapter 4 and
Appendix in @Brown1980]. The full analysis is implemented in software
specific to Q, predominantly PQMethod, which is freely available,
written in Fortran, and fully functional in Windows and Mac-OS
[@Schmolck2012]. Other software include PCQ [paid-license, Windows only,
@Stricklin2004] and Q-Assessor [paid-license, web-based,
@Epimetrics2010]. The latter two provide tools for data collection, but
the final output and report are virtually the same in all three.

This R package improves the existing Q software in a number of ways. It
is fully cross-platform. It allows a completely transparent examination
of the equations and the constants used in the computation at each step
of the analysis, helping researchers to better understand the process.
For the data reduction technique, correlation coefficients other than
Pearson are also allowed. The output is concisely structured and
tabulated in numerical form rather than in a large fixed width text
file, therefore it provides a more straightforward and flexible means to
study and handle the results. Thus
[*qmethod*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=qmethod) [@qmethod]
results can be easily used for further quantitative modelling and for
graphical representation. In addition, the final output in this package
provides a clearer and more synthetic report on distinguishing and
consensus statements (see below). The package also includes a specific
`plot()` method to build a novel visualisation of the results, as well
as import and export functionality.

# The Q methodology

Q is a powerful methodology to shed light on complex problems in which
human subjectivity is involved. Subjectivity is understood as how people
conceive and communicate their point of view about a subject
[@McKeown1988]. The method originated from a 1935 proposal to correlate
respondents instead of variables in FA by Stephenson [@Stephenson1935],
an assistant to Spearman---the developer of FA. Q was used initially in
psychology, then in political science, and, after that, in several other
fields. The analytical process is clearly structured and well
established [@Stephenson1953; @Brown1980], and Q is increasingly being
used across disciplines and for different purposes such as policy
evaluation, understanding decision-making, or participatory processes.

The following characteristics of the methodology will help in deciding
whether it is a suitable approach for a given question. It is versatile
due to its compatibility with small samples (see below). It is
predominantly exploratory because the patterns of views emerge from the
study and thus prevent the researcher from imposing a frame of reference
or pre-determined assumptions and definitions
[@McKeown1988; @Willig2008]. It is a mixed or semi-qualitative
methodology because though the data collected are quantitatively
analysed, their interpretation is extensively qualitative [@Ramlo2011]
and makes thorough use of theory. The results can be used in combination
with other qualitative methods and as a starting point for quantitative
confirmatory methods. For example, Q can be combined with discourse
analysis, or it can be used in regression models to examine how
perspectives influence behaviour. The basic analytical principle is to
correlate the entire responses of individuals. These responses are
measured using the same unit, which is often called *psychological
significance* or *self-significance*, and they indicate the salience
(engagement or disengagement) of the statement for the respondent. Both
aspects contrast with regular FA, in which variables are correlated and,
having different units, may also be incommensurable.

## Research design

In its most frequent form, the Q approach consists of selecting a set of
statements and asking respondents to sort them over a grid, from *most
agreement* to *most disagreement* (see Figure [1](#figure:grid) for an
example of a grid). The statements are a representative sample of the
concourse, the whole set of possible expressions on a topic, gathered
from all possible points of view (in theory, a concourse would be
infinite). The researcher collects a large set of statements from
interviews, reviews of literature or mass media, expert consultation,
participant observation, etc. This collection is reduced to a final
representative selection that usually ranges between $40$ and $80$
statements [@Watts2012]. The statements can express understandings or
behavioural preferences relating to the topic. Occasionally, photos,
sounds, or other types of stimuli may be used instead of statements.

![Figure 1: An example of a grid to sort statements in Q
method.](grid.png){#figure:grid width="100%" alt="graphic without alt text"}

The sample of respondents does not need to be large or representative of
the population, but it must be diverse. The aim is to get the most
diverse range of opinions, regardless of whether they are minority ones.
The shape of the grid used to sort the statements is up to the
researcher. This grid is usually bell-shaped as in
Figure [1](#figure:grid), assuming that fewer statements generate strong
engagement [@Brown1980]. Respondents commonly sort the statements
according to their agreement or disagreement, although there are other
possible conditions of instruction---different ways in which
participants are asked to sort the statements [@McKeown1988], e. g.,
"*Sort the statements according to how person A would respond*". A
succinct description of the research design can be found in
@VanExel2005, @Watts2012 offer a detailed reference manual, and a key
and extensive work is that of @Brown1980.

## Analytical process {#subsec:analysis}

The data collected from all respondents are introduced into a matrix
with statements as rows and respondents as columns, where the cell
values are the score in the grid in which the respondent sorted the
statement. For example, in Figure [1](#figure:grid) the statements that
a respondent most disagreed with would get a score of $-4$. Sample data
available with the package can be loaded by using the command
`data(lipset)`. The array of scores for all the statements sorted by a
single respondent (the column) is called the Q-sort.

The process of analysis has two main parts. In the first, a multivariate
data reduction technique is applied, either centroid factor analysis or
PCA. This package currently implements only the PCA solution. PCA is
readily available in R, and the results from both techniques are similar
[@McKeown1988; @Watts2012]. The centroid algorithm for factor analysis
is an alternative method for FA used almost exclusively in Q methodology
and described in @Brown1980. This algorithm differs from standard FA (as
implemented in `factanal()`) and their results, although highly
correlated, are not identical.

Initially, a correlation matrix between Q-sorts is built, and the chosen
multivariate technique reduces this correlation matrix into components.
The components are ordered by the total variability that they explain,
and so the first components summarise most of the variability of the
initial correlation matrix. Then the first few components are selected
and rotated in order to obtain a clearer and simpler structure of the
data. The usual criteria by which the number of components is selected
include, *inter alia*, the total amount of variability explained,
eigenvalues higher than a certain threshold---both accessible through
the call `loadings(principal(...))` from
[*psych*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=psych) [@Psych2014], and a
compromised solution between complexity and interpretability [further
details about the possible criteria are given in @Watts2012].

The rotation of components in Q studies can be either manual
(judgemental) or mathematically optimal (analytical). The rotation
results in a matrix of component loadings with Q-sorts as rows and
components as columns, indicating the relationship between each Q-sort
and component. Mathematical rotation is implemented in the package
within the function `qmethod()`. This function calls internally
`principal()` from *psych*, which conveniently wraps the rotation modes
from [*GPArotation*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=GPArotation)
[@GPArotation2005] into a single function. Any of the rotations
implemented in `principal()` can be called in *qmethod*, and `"varimax"`
is the most commonly used. Manual rotation is not integrated in the
current version.[^2]

The second part of the analysis is particular to Q. It consists of a)
flagging the Q-sorts that will define each component (hereafter called
*factor*, as it usually is in the literature; implemented in the
function `qflag()`), b) calculating the scores of statements for each
factor (z-scores and factor scores, implemented in `qzscore()`), and c)
finding the distinguishing and consensus statements (implemented in
`qda()`).[^3]

The most representative Q-sorts for each factor are flagged (a), meaning
that only these Q-sorts are used for subsequent calculations. The
purpose of flagging is to obtain more distinguishable perspectives, and
it may be done either automatically or manually, the latter occurring
when the researcher has relevant knowledge about any of the respondents.
Automatic flagging is based on two criteria: that the loading $\ell$
should be significantly high (the significance threshold for a p-value
$< .05$ is given by equation \@ref(eq:loasig), where $N$ is the number
of statements; @Brown1980), and that the square loading for a factor $j$
should be higher than the sum of the square loadings for all other
factors (equation \@ref(eq:loavar), where $f$ is the total number of
factors; @Brown1980). Some Q-sorts may be considered confounding because
they load highly in more than one factor and thus they are not flagged.
Alternatively, manual flagging may be used (see details on how to run
manual flagging in [Implementation of the analysis in qmethod](#sec:implement)). 

$$\begin{aligned}
 \label{eq:loasig} 
\ell&>\dfrac{1.96}{\sqrt{N}}  \end{aligned}  (\#eq:loasig)  $$

$$\begin{aligned}
\label{eq:loavar} 
\ell^2_j&>\sum\limits_{i = 1}^f{\ell^2_i}-\ell^2_j  
\end{aligned}  (\#eq:loavar)  $$ The z-scores (b) indicate the
relationship between statements and factors, i. e., how much each factor
*agrees* with a statement. The z-score is a weighted average of the
scores given by the flagged Q-sorts to that statement. The factor scores
are obtained by rounding the z-scores towards the array of discrete
values in the grid. In Figure [1](#figure:grid), this array of discrete
values would be `c(-4, -4, -3, -3, -3, -2, ... , 4)`.[^4] The final
outcome of the analysis is the selected number of factors, representing
one perspective each. These perspectives are a hypothetical Q-sort that
has been reconstructed from the factor scores.

Next, some general characteristics are calculated in order to compare
the factors. For each factor, the following are provided: the number of
flagged Q-sorts, the composite reliability, and the standard error
(*SE*) of factor scores. Two additional matrices indicate the similarity
between the z-scores of each pair of factors: the correlation
coefficients and the standard error of differences (SED, based on the
*SE*).[^5]

Finally, the factor comparison identifies the consensus and
distinguishing statements (c). For each pair of factors, if the
difference between the z-scores of a statement is statistically
significant (based on the SED), then what both factors *think* about
that statement is distinct. When none of the differences between any
pair of factors are significant, then the statement is considered of
consensus.

## Interpretation and reporting

The interpretation of each perspective is based on the Q-sort
reconstructed from the factor scores and on the salience and
distinctiveness of the statements. Each respondent may be more closely
related to one of the perspectives, and this relation is determined by
the loadings calculated at the beginning. The key elements to look at
are the relative position of statements within the grid (particularly
those at the extremes), the position of a statement in a perspective
versus the position of the same statement in other perspectives, and the
distinguishing and consensus statements. Each perspective is given a
semantic denomination and is described in as much length as necessary,
each description deriving from the literature and from qualitative
explanations collected after each response.

The essential characteristics of a Q study include the process of
selecting statements, the shape of the distribution grid, the number of
participants and the criteria for their selection, the methods for
extraction and rotation of factors, and the number of Q-sorts loading on
each factor. The results are usually reported with a table of statements
including either their z-scores or factor scores, and an indication of
which statements are distinguishing and which consensus. The table of
factor loadings may also be included, showing the Q-sorts that were
flagged.

# Implementation of the analysis in *qmethod* {#sec:implement}

The core of the package consists of a main function `qmethod()` and four
subordinate functions that conform to the steps of the analysis:
`qflag()`, `qzscores()`, `qfcharact()`, and `qdc()`. The function
`qmethod()` is a wrapper that calls internally PCA to calculate loadings
and the four other functions. The individual functions can be run
independently to build the analysis step-by-step in order to maintain
more control over what happens at each stage or to perform more advanced
analysis. Yet running the individual steps will rarely be necessary
unless the researcher wants to use other methods for extraction or
manual flagging. The core functionality is complemented with additional
functions to print, summarize, plot, import, and export.

The raw data is provided to `qmethod()` as a matrix or data frame with
statements as rows and Q-sorts as columns. The number of factors to
extract is necessary, and this can be decided upon exploration of the
raw data based on criteria recommended in the literature, as explained
above in [Analytical process](#subsec:analysis). The method for rotation is `"varimax"` by default, but other
methods can be specified. If respondents do not have to follow the
distribution grid strictly when sorting the statements, then the
argument `forced` should be `FALSE` and a vector must be provided in the
argument `distribution`. This `distribution` vector is the array of
values corresponding to the grid. By calling `qmethod()` with all the
necessary arguments, the full analysis is performed and the outputs are
put together in an object of class `"QmethodRes"`.

In order to run manual flagging, the functions corresponding to
individual steps may be used instead of `qmethod()`: namely,
`qzscores()` and `qdc()` (`qfcharact()` is called internally in
`qzscores()`). First, and in order to assess which Q-sorts to flag, one
may run the function `qflag()` and examine the resulting table of
loadings. Second, in `qzscores()` a logical matrix of $n$ Q-sorts and
$f$ factors may be provided in the argument `flagged`, where the cells
may be `TRUE` to indicate flagging. After calculating the z-scores,
distinguishing and consensus statements may be identified using the
function `qdc()`.

The package also allows the use of correlation coefficients other than
Pearson for the extraction of factors, namely Spearman and Kendall.
These may be appropriate for non-parametric data and may sometimes
enable a greater amount of variability to be explained with fewer
factors [for a technical note about correlation coefficients, see
@Brown1980 p. 276].

## Understanding and exploring results from the *qmethod()* function {#subsec:qmethods}

The function `qmethod()` returns the results in a list of class
`"QmethodRes"` containing eight objects. The method `print()` for an
object of class `"QmethodRes"` provides a snapshot of the full results
with descriptive names for each object within the list, as listed below
(in parenthesis, the actual names of the objects within the list).[^6]
The method `summary()` displays the essential tables. In order to
visualize the results at a glance, the method `plot()` builds a
dot-chart of z-scores, as in Figure [2](#figure:plot).

1.  "*Q-method analysis*" `(...$brief)`: a list with basic information
    of the analysis including date, number of Q-sorts and of statements,
    number of factors extracted, and rotation.

2.  "*Original data*" `(...$dataset)`: a data frame with the raw data.

3.  "*Q-sort factor loadings*" `(...$loa)`: a data frame with the
    rotated loadings obtained from `principal()`.

4.  "*Flagged Q-sorts*" `(...$flagged)`: a logical data frame indicating
    which Q-sorts are flagged for which factors, obtained from
    `qflag()`.

5.  "*Statement z-scores*" `(...$zsc)`: the weighted average value of
    each statement for each factor, obtained from `qzscores()`.

6.  "*Statement factor scores*" `(...$zscn)`: the scores rounded to
    match the array of discrete values in the distribution, obtained
    from `qzscores()`.

7.  "*Factor characteristics*" `(...$fchar)`: a list of three objects,
    obtained from `qfcharact()`:

    1.  A matrix with the general characteristics of each factor
        `(...$fchar$characteristics)`:

        -   Average reliability coefficient

        -   Number of loading Q-sorts

        -   Eigenvalues

        -   Percentage of explained variance

        -   Composite reliability

        -   Standard error of factor scores

    2.  The matrix of "*Correlation between factor z-scores*"
        `(...$fchar$corzsc)`.

    3.  The matrix of "*Standard errors of differences between factors*"
        `(...$fchar$sddif)`.

8.  "*Distinguishing and consensus statements*" `(...$qdc)`: a data
    frame that compares the z-scores between all pairs of factors,
    obtained from `qcd()`.

The last object "*Distinguishing and consensus statements*" may be
explained in detail. This object results from an internal call to the
function `qdc()`. For each pair of factors, this function calculates the
absolute difference in z-scores and compares this difference with the
significance thresholds for $.05$ and $.01$ p-value levels. The function
`qdc()` returns a data frame with statements as rows and comparisons as
columns. All the comparisons are synthesised in the first variable of
the data frame, which is a categorical variable named `"dist.and.cons"`
that indicates whether the statement is of consensus or distinguishing
for one or more factors (see an example below in [Usage example](#sec:example)). The following are
the possible categories that a statement can fall into in the
`"dist.and.cons"` variable:

-   "*Distinguishes all*": When all the differences between all pairs of
    factors are significant.

-   "*Distinguishes $f_i$ only*": When the differences between factor
    $i$ and all other factors are significant, and the differences
    between all other pairs of factors are not.

-   "*Distinguishes $f_i$ (\...)*": When the differences between factor
    $i$ and all other factors are significant, and some (but not all) of
    the differences between other pairs of factors are significant. If
    this is the case for more than one factor, the string is
    concatenated, e. g., "`Distinguishes f1 Distinguishes f3`". This
    category may arise only in solutions of four or more factors.

-   "*Consensus*": When none of the differences are significant because
    all factors give the statement a similar score.

-   \"\": Leaves an empty string in the cell of those statements which
    do not fulfil any of the above conditions, i. e., statements that
    are neither consensus nor clearly distinguishing any factor from all
    the rest. But while they do not distinguish any particular factor
    from all the rest, they do distinguish some pairs of factors. The
    role of these statements may be inspected in detail by looking at
    the significance columns.

This structure of results is different from that of other Q software and
it contains all the necessary information without any redundancy. This
output can be converted into the exact outline provided by PQMethod by
using the function `export.qm()` (see below), an outline that is much
longer. Most of this conversion consists of taking the data frames of
z-scores, of factor scores, and of distinguishing and consensus
statements (objects 5, 6, and 8 within the list of results), and
reordering or merging them according to different criteria.

## Importing and exporting data

The function `import.pqmethod()` retrieves data from a .DAT file, which
is the raw data file saved by PQMethod software. Individual data frames
from a `"QmethodRes"` object may be exported as a CSV using, for
example, `write.table()` (to find the objects to export from within the
list of results, see the description of the outputs above in [Understanding and exploring results from the qmethod() function](#subsec:qmethods)). The
function `export.qm()` saves all the results obtained from `qmethod()`
in a text file, building the report which is then used for the
interpretation. This report has two flavours defined in the argument
`style`: `"R"` and `"PQMethod"`. `"R"` exports the results exactly as
the function `qmethod()` returns them. `"PQmethod"` exports the results
following the structure of the output in PQMethod (a .LIS file). Note
that the latter is a much longer outline and has some redundant
information in the form of tables reordered according to different
criteria. This alternative outline might be convenient for researchers
accustomed to PQMethod.

# Usage example {#sec:example}

For demonstration purposes, I use the *Lipset* dataset about the value
patterns of democracy [@Lipset1963 and @Stephenson1970, both in
@Brown1980], which contains $9$ respondents and $33$ statements. The
following code performs a full analysis using principal components and
varimax rotation to extract three components (*factors*).

``` r
data(lipset)
lipset[[1]] # Shows the dataset, a matrix of 33x9
lipset[[2]] # Shows the text of the 33 statements
results <- qmethod(lipset[[1]], nfactors = 3, rotation = "varimax")
```

The object `results` is of class `"QmethodRes"`, and the specific method
`summary()` for this class returns the basic information and the data
frame of factor scores as shown below. This data frame contains the
three factors or main perspectives. Each perspective has a distinct
array of statement scores, which correspond to the scores in
Figure [1](#figure:grid) and indicate the agreement or disagreement of
the given perspective with each statement. For example, perspective one
is in strong agreement with statement 1 (`"sta_1"` has a score of $4$),
whereas the statement deserves the opposite opinion according to
perspective two (a score of $-2$) and perspective three considers it in
the middle ground (a score of $1$). The next matrix contains general
information about each factor, of which the most relevant piece may be
the number of loading Q-sorts and the explained variance, which are
approximate indicators of the strength of each perspective and of the
proportion of the opinions they explain.

name indicated under [Understanding and exploring results from the qmethod() function](#subsec:qmethods)
, and thus customised for easier exploration. For
instance, the z-scores may be shown by using the command `results$zsc`.
In the example below, the factor scores are merged with the actual text
of the statements and then ordered. The data frame is reordered
according to the scores of the statements for each factor, so that the
researcher can quickly identify which statements are in most agreement
for a given perspective, and what other perspectives think of the same
statements:

``` r
# Merge the statements with their actual text:
scores <- cbind(results$zsc_n, lipset[[2]])

# Order the results by the scores of each factor:
for (i in 1:length(results$loa)) {
    View(scores[order(scores[i], decreasing = TRUE), ], 
         title = paste0("Order for f", i))
}
```

The method `plot()` for class `"QmethodRes"` returns a dot-chart of the
z-scores specifically adapted for Q methodology, as in
Figure [2](#figure:plot). In this figure, built with the code below, the
comparison among the z-scores of all factors can be explored. For
example, all three points are far from each other in statement 33,
meaning that each of the three factors holds a distinctive opinion
regarding this statement. For statement 20, however, the points are
clustered together, indicating consensus. Finally, statement 16 clearly
distinguishes factor three from the rest (its point being far from the
other two).

``` r
par(lwd = 1.5, mar = c(4, 4, 0, 0) + 0.1)
plot(results)
abline(h = seq(from = 2, to = 32, by = 3), col = grey(0.2), lty = 2)
```

three factors.](plot.png){#figure:plot width="100%" alt="graphic without alt text"}

The table of distinguishing and consensus statements below conveys the
observations gleaned from Figure [2](#figure:plot) with greater
precision. For example, column `"f1_f2"` shows the absolute difference
in z-scores between factor one and factor two. In the column immediately
to the right (`"sig_f1_f2"`), a single star or double star indicate
differences that are significant at p-values $< .05$ and $< .01$
respectively, and arise from the magnitude of the difference and the
thresholds given by the SED.

In the above example, the statements 3, 6, 8, 9, etc. (labelled
`"Distinguishes f1 only"`) distinguish factor one ($f1$) but do not
distinguish $f2$ from $f3$. The statements 1, 7, 15, 19, and 33
(labelled `"Distinguishes all"`) distinguish both $f1$ from the other
two and also $f2$ from $f3$: all factors think differently about these
statements. Meanwhile, statements 14 and 20 are of consensus because
none of their differences are significant at p-level $= .05$ (no stars
appear in any of the `"sig_*"` columns). In addition, those statements
with empty values under `"dist.and.cons"` need to be looked at
individually (statements 12, 17, 22, 25, 27, and 29). For example,
statements 12 and 25 distinguish $f1$ from $f3$, but they do not
distinguish either against $f2$ (whose p-value is $<.05$ as indicated in
column `"sig_f1_f3"`, but none of the other comparisons are
significant).

# Validation

The package was validated with the `lipset` dataset and with three other
datasets, extracting $2$, $3$, $4$ and $5$ factors with each of them.
The results of *qmethod* were contrasted with the results of analyses
based on the same options but performed in PQMethod. For studies of $1$
to $3$ factors, all the numbers in factor loadings and z-scores match to
the fourth decimal those given in PQMethod. For studies of $4$ or more
factors, all the numbers match to the second decimal. Occasional
divergences in the third and fourth decimals of the loading values arise
from the PCA algorithms themselves, which are coded externally to this
package.[^7] The factor scores match in all cases.

The selection of distinguishing statements matches exactly. A difference
in the selection of consensus statements is due to a greater
restrictiveness in this package. For in *qmethod*, the only statements
identified as consensus are those in which none of the differences are
significant at p-value $< .05$ (that is, only those statements which do
not produce stars in any columns). PQMethod also indicates consensus
statements with no significances at p-value $< .05$ with a star, but it
further identifies as *consensus* those statements with some differences
significant at a p-value between $.01$ and $.05$ (these statements have
single stars in some of the comparisons, though no double stars). In
PQMethod, therefore, the statements with differences significant at a
p-value between $.01$ and $.05$ are shown both consensus and the
distinguishing lists for some or all of the factors. For example in the
above table, statements 12, 17, 25, 26, and 29 have no double stars but
have one or more single stars; in PQMethod these would be included as
both *distinguishing* and *consensus* statements. Such double labelling
can be confusing in the interpretation. Whereas in this package the
statements with differences significant at a p-value between $.05$ and
$.01$ are not labelled as consensus, but rather as `"Distinguishes f*"`,
`"Distinguishes all"`, or `""`, depending on each case. The role of each
statement can be fully understood by inspecting the table of
distinguishing and consensus statements.

The order of factors in the matrices (e. g., in the matrix of loadings)
may differ between both tools in some cases. This is because in R, the
components in PCA are ordered according to the explained variance of the
rotated components. In PQMethod, the factors are ordered according to
the explained variance of the unrotated factors instead. This
discrepancy affects neither the numerical results nor the
interpretation.

# Summary and future work

Q is an effective methodology for understanding the diversity of
perspectives across disciplines. *qmethod* is the first R package to
analyse Q methodology data. This package produces tabulated results that
are easy to examine and interpret, and ready for graphical
representation or further numerical analysis. It provides a more concise
output of distinguishing and consensus statements as well as a
synthesising plot function. This core functionality is complemented by
additional functions that import data from other Q software, summarise
the results, and export the outputs in plain text for the interpretation
in two flavours. Further usage details can be found in the *qmethod*
reference manual available from CRAN. Potential developments for the
current implementation include the introduction of centroid extraction
as an alternative to PCA, manual rotation of factors, a graphical
interface, functions for data collection, and a 3D plot method to
explore the results further. Researchers who would like to contribute to
these or other developments are welcome to contact the author.

:::

[^1]: While the Likert scales predominate in practice, Q-sorts are also
    widely used and include standardised sets of statements. The
    advantages and disadvantages are reviewed in [@Serfass2013].

[^2]: The graphical interface PQROT, for Windows and Mac-OS only,
    complements PQMethod and allows manual rotation.

[^3]: All the necessary equations are detailed in @Brown1980 and may be
    examined in the corresponding R function by typing its name, e. g.,
    `qzscore`.

[^4]: The calculations of both z-scores and rounded scores are
    implemented in the function `qzscores()`. The function calculates
    factor weights and the weighted average scores for each statement.
    Then it standardizes the scores into the z-scores and rounds the
    z-scores to the discrete values of the distribution.

[^5]: All the general factor characteristics are calculated in the
    function `qdcharact()`. These are based on the loadings, the flagged
    Q-sorts, and a matrix of z-scores resulting from `qzscores()`.

[^6]: Note that in the output of results the statements have a unique ID
    of the type `"n*"` and the actual text of the statements is not
    merged. Adding the corresponding text of the statements to the final
    results can be easily done using, for example, `merge()`, `cbind()`
    or `rownames()`. See an example below in [Usage example](#sec:example).

[^7]: Four different R functions for principal components were compared
    with two datasets to test whether the method employed is the source
    of this divergence: `prcomp()`, `princomp()`, both from the base
    package *stats*, `principal()` from *psych*, and `PCA()` from
    [*FactoMineR*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=FactoMineR)
    [@Factominer2014]. The results show that loadings and z-scores
    obtained from these methods differ only after the 14th decimal.
