title: 'mudfold: An R Package for Nonparametric IRT Modelling of Unfolding Processes'
abstract: Item response theory (IRT) models for unfolding processes use the responses
  of individuals to attitudinal tests or questionnaires in order to infer item and
  person parameters located on a latent continuum. Parametric models in this class
  use parametric functions to model the response process, which in practice can be
  restrictive. MUDFOLD (Multiple UniDimensional unFOLDing) can be used to obtain estimates
  of person and item ranks without imposing strict parametric assumptions on the item
  response functions (IRFs). This paper describes the implementation of the MUDFOLD
  method for binary preferential-choice data in the R package mudfold. The latter
  incorporates estimation, visualization, and simulation methods in order to provide
  R users with utilities for nonparametric analysis of attitudinal questionnaire data.
  After a brief introduction in IRT, we provide the method ological framework implemented
  in the package. A description of the available functions is followed by practical
  examples and suggestions on how this method can be used even outside the field of
  psychometrics.
