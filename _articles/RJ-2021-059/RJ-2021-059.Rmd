title: The HBV.IANIGLA Hydrological Model
abstract: Over the past 40 years, the HBV (Hydrologiska Byr√•ns Vattenbalansavdelning)
  hydrological model has been one of the most used worldwide due to its robustness,
  simplicity, and reliable results. Despite these advantages, the available versions
  impose some limitations for research studies in mountain watersheds dominated by
  ice-snow melt runoff (i.e., no glacier module, a limited number of elevation bands,
  among other constraints). Here we present HBV.IANIGLA, a tool for hydroclimatic
  studies in regions with steep topography and/or cryospheric processes which provides
  a modular and extended implementation of the HBV model as an R package. To our knowledge,
  this is the first modular version of the original HBV model. This feature can be
  very useful for teaching hydrological modeling, as it offers the possibility to
  build a customized, open-source model that can be adjusted to different requirements
  of students and users.
