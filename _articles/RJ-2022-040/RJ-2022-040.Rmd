title: 'R-miss-tastic: a unified platform for missing values methods and workflows'
abstract: Missing values are unavoidable when working with data. Their occurrence
  is exacerbated as more data from different sources become available. However, most
  statistical models and visualization methods require complete data, and improper
  handling of missing data results in information loss or biased analyses. Since the
  seminal work of Rubin (1976), a burgeoning literature on missing values has arisen,
  with heterogeneous aims and motivations. This led to the development of various
  methods, formalizations, and tools. For practitioners, however, it remains a challenge
  to decide which method is most appropriate for their problem, in part because this
  topic is not systematically covered in statistics or data science curricula. To
  help address this challenge, we have launched the `R-miss-tastic` platform, which
  aims to provide an overview of standard missing values problems, methods, and relevant
  implementations of methodologies. Beyond gathering and organizing a large majority
  of the material on missing data (bibliography, courses, tutorials, implementations),
  `R-miss-tastic` covers the development of standardized analysis workﬂows. Indeed,
  we have developed several pipelines in R and Python to allow for hands-on illustration
  of and recommendations on missing values handling in various statistical tasks such
  as matrix completion, estimation, and prediction, while ensuring reproducibility
  of the analyses. Finally, the platform is dedicated to users who analyze incomplete
  data, researchers who want to compare their methods and search for an up-to-date
  bibliography, and teachers who are looking for didactic materials (notebooks, recordings,
  lecture notes).
