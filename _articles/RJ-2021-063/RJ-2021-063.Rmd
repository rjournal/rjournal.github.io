title: 'stratamatch: Prognostic Score Stratification Using a Pilot Design'
abstract: ' Optimal propensity score matching has emerged as one of the most ubiquitous
  approaches for causal inference studies on observational data. However, outstanding
  critiques of the statistical properties of propensity score matching have cast doubt
  on the statistical efficiency of this technique, and the poor scalability of optimal
  matching to large data sets makes this approach inconvenient if not infeasible for
  sample sizes that are increasingly commonplace in modern observational data. The
  [stratamatch](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=stratamatch) package provides implementation
  support and diagnostics for ''stratified matching designs,'' an approach that addresses
  both of these issues with optimal propensity score matching for large-sample observational
  studies. First, stratifying the data enables more computationally efficient matching
  of large data sets. Second, stratamatch implements a ''pilot design'' approach in
  order to stratify by a prognostic score, which may increase the precision of the
  effect estimate and increase power in sensitivity analyses of unmeasured confounding.'
