title: 'stratamatch: Prognostic Score Stratification Using a Pilot Design'
abstract: |
  Optimal propensity score matching has emerged as one of the most ubiquitous approaches
   for causal inference studies on observational data. However, outstanding critiques of the statistical
   properties of propensity score matching have cast doubt on the statistical efficiency of this technique,
   and the poor scalability of optimal matching to large data sets makes this approach inconvenient
   if not infeasible for sample sizes that are increasingly commonplace in modern observational data.
   The stratamatch package provides implementation support and diagnostics for ‘stratified matching
   designs,’ an approach that addresses both of these issues with optimal propensity score matching for
   large-sample observational studies. First, stratifying the data enables more computationally efficient
   matching of large data sets. Second, stratamatch implements a ‘pilot design’ approach in order to
   stratify by a prognostic score, which may increase the precision of the effect estimate and increase
   power in sensitivity analyses of unmeasured confounding.
