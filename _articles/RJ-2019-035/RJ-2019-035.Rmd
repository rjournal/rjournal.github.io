title: 'BINCOR: An R package for Estimating the Correlation between Two Unevenly Spaced
  Time Series'
abstract: 'This paper presents a computational program named BINCOR (BINned CORrelation)
  for estimating the correlation between two unevenly spaced time series. This program
  is also applicable to the situation of two evenly spaced time series not on the
  same time grid. BINCOR is based on a novel estimation approach proposed by Mudelsee
  (2010) for estimating the correlation between two climate time series with different
  timescales. The idea is that autocorrelation (e.g. an AR1 process) means that memory
  enables values obtained on different time points to be correlated. Binned correlation
  is performed by resampling the time series under study into time bins on a regular
  grid, assigning the mean values of the variable under scrutiny within those bins.
  We present two examples of our BINCOR package with real data: instrumental and paleoclimatic
  time series. In both applications BINCOR works properly in detecting well-established
  relationships between the climate records compared.'
