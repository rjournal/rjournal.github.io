title: 'hglm: A Package for Fitting Hierarchical Generalized Linear Models'
abstract: We present the hglm package for fitting hierarchical generalized linear
  models. It can be used for linear mixed models and generalized linear mixed models
  with random effects for a variety of links and a variety of distributions for both
  the outcomes and the random effects. Fixed effects can also be fitted in the dispersion
  part of the model.
