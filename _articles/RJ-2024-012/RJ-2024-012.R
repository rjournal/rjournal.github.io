(a) LUCID early integration; (b) LUCID in parallel; (c) LUCID in serial. The squares represent observed data, the circles represent unobserved latent variables (clusters) and model parameters, and the diamond refers to $L_1$ penalty terms for regularization for (a). $\\boldsymbol{\\mathbf{CoG}}$ and $\\boldsymbol{\\mathbf{CoY}}$ represent covariates to be adjusted in the LUCID model. Missingness is allowed in multi-omics data. $\\boldsymbol{\\mathbf{Z}}$ is divided into subsets of observations with complete measurements and observations with missingness.
