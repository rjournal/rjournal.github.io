title: Network Visualization with ggplot2
abstract: This paper explores three different approaches to visualize networks by
  building on the grammar of graphics framework implemented in the ggplot2 package.
  The goal of each approach is to provide the user with the ability to apply the flexibility
  of ggplot2 to the visualization of network data, including through the mapping of
  network attributes to specific plot aesthetics. By incorporating networks in the
  ggplot2 framework, these approaches (1) allow users to enhance networks with additional
  information on edges and nodes, (2) give access to the strengths of ggplot2, such
  as layers and facets, and (3) convert network data objects to the more familiar
  data frames.
