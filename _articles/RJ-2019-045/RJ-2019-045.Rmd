title: 'biclustermd: An R Package for Biclustering with Missing Values'
abstract: Biclustering is a statistical learning technique that attempts to find homogeneous
  partitions of rows and columns of a data matrix. For example, movie ratings might
  be biclustered to group both raters and movies. biclust is a current R package allowing
  users to implement a variety of biclustering algorithms. However, its algorithms
  do not allow the data matrix to have missing values. We provide a new R package,
  biclustermd, which allows users to perform biclustering on numeric data even in
  the presence of missing values.
