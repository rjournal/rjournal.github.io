title: The Complex Multivariate Gaussian Distribution
abstract: Here I introduce package cmvnorm, a complex generalization of the mvtnorm
  package. A complex generalization of the Gaussian process is suggested and numerical
  results presented using the package. An application in the context of approximating
  the Weierstrass σ-function using a complex Gaussian process is given.
