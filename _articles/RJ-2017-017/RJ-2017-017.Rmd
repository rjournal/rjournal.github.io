title: Weighted Effect Coding for Observational Data with wec
abstract: Weighted effect coding refers to a specific coding matrix to include factor
  variables in generalised linear regression models. With weighted effect coding,
  the effect for each category represents the deviation of that category from the
  weighted mean (which corresponds to the sample mean). This technique has particularly
  attractive properties when analysing observational data, that commonly are unbalanced.
  The wec package is introduced, that provides functions to apply weighted effect
  coding to factor variables, and to interactions between (a.) a factor variable and
  a continuous variable and between (b.) two factor variables.
