title: Advanced Bayesian Multilevel Modeling with the R Package brms
abstract: The brms package allows R users to easily specify a wide range of Bayesian
  single-level and multilevel models which are fit with the probabilistic programming
  language Stan behind the scenes. Several response distributions are supported, of
  which all parameters (e.g., location, scale, and shape) can be predicted. Non-linear
  relationships may be specified using non-linear predictor terms or semi-parametric
  approaches such as splines or Gaussian processes. Multivariate models can be fit
  as well. To make all of these modeling options possible in a multilevel framework,
  brms provides an intuitive and powerful formula syntax, which extends the well known
  formula syntax of lme4. The purpose of the present paper is to introduce this syntax
  in detail and to demonstrate its usefulness with four examples, each showing relevant
  aspects of the syntax.
