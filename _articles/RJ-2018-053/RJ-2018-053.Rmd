title: 'stplanr: A Package for Transport Planning'
abstract: 'Tools for transport planning should be flexible, scalable, and transparent.
  The stplanr package demonstrates and provides a home for such tools, with an emphasis
  on spatial transport data and non-motorized modes. The stplanr package facilitates
  common transport planning tasks including: downloading and cleaning transport datasets;
  creating geographic “desire lines” from origin-destination (OD) data; route assignment,
  locally and interfaces to routing services such as CycleStreets.net; calculation
  of route segment attributes such as bearing and aggregate flow; and ‘travel watershed’
  analysis. This paper demonstrates this functionality using reproducible examples
  on real transport datasets. More broadly, the experience of developing and using
  R functions for transport applications shows that open source software can form
  the basis of a reproducible transport planning workflow. The stplanr package, alongside
  other packages and open source projects, could provide a more transparent and democratically
  accountable alternative to the current approach, which is heavily reliant on proprietary
  and relatively inaccessible software.'
