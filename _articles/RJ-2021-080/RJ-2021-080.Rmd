title: Multiple Imputation and Synthetic Data Generation with NPBayesImputeCat
abstract: In many contexts, missing data and disclosure control are ubiquitous and
  challenging issues. In particular, at statistical agencies, the respondent-level
  data they collect from surveys and censuses can suffer from high rates of missingness.
  Furthermore, agencies are obliged to protect respondentsâ€™ privacy when publishing
  the collected data for public use. The NPBayesImputeCat R package, introduced in
  this paper, provides routines to i) create multiple imputations for missing data
  and ii) create synthetic data for statistical disclosure control, for multivariate
  categorical data, with or without structural zeros. We describe the Dirichlet process
  mixture of products of the multinomial distributions model used in the package and
  illustrate various uses of the package using data samples from the American Community
  Survey (ACS). We also compare results of the missing data imputation to the mice
  R package and those of the synthetic data generation to the synthpop R package.
