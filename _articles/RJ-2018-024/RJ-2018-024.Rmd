title: R Package imputeTestbench to Compare Imputation Methods for Univariate Time
  Series
abstract: Missing observations are common in time series data and several methods
  are available to impute these values prior to analysis. Variation in statistical
  characteristics of univariate time series can have a profound effect on characteristics
  of missing observations and, therefore, the accuracy of different imputation methods.
  The imputeTestbench package can be used to compare the prediction accuracy of different
  methods as related to the amount and type of missing data for a user-supplied dataset.
  Missing data are simulated by removing observations completely at random or in blocks
  of different sizes depending on characteristics of the data. Several imputation
  algorithms are included with the package that vary from simple replacement with
  means to more complex interpolation methods. The testbench is not limited to the
  default functions and users can add or remove methods as needed. Plotting functions
  also allow comparative visualization of the behavior and effectiveness of different
  algorithms. We present example applications that demonstrate how the package can
  be used to understand differences in prediction accuracy between methods as affected
  by characteristics of a dataset and the nature of missing data.
