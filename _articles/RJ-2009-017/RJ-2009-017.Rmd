title: 'sos: Searching Help Pages of R Packages'
abstract: The sos package provides a means to quickly and flexibly search the help
  pages of contributed packages, finding functions and datasets in seconds or minutes
  that could not be found in hours or days by any other means we know. Its findFn
  function accesses Jonathan Baron’s R Site Search database and returns the matches
  in a data frame of class "findFn", which can be further manipulated by other sos
  functions to produce, for example, an Excel file that starts with a summary sheet
  that makes it relatively easy to prioritize alternative packages for further study.
  As such, it provides a very powerful way to do a literature search for functions
  and packages relevant to a particular topic of interest and could become virtually
  mandatory for authors of new packages or papers in publications such as The R Journal
  and the Journal of Statistical Software.
