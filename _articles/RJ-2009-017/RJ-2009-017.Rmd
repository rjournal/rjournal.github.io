# Introduction

The [*sos*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=sos) package provides a
means to quickly and flexibly search the help pages of contributed
packages, finding functions and datasets in seconds or minutes that
could not be found in hours or days by any other means we know.

The main capability of this package is the `findFn` function, which
scans the "function" entries in Jonathan Baron's *R site search*
database [@JB09URL] and returns the matches in a data frame of class
`"findFn"`. Baron's site is one of five search capabilities currently
identified under \"Search\" from the main <http://www.r-project.org/>
web site. It includes options to search the help pages of R packages
contributed to CRAN (the Comprehensive R Archive Network) plus a few
other publicly available packages, as well as selected mailing list
archives---primarily R-help. The `findFn` function focuses only on the
help pages in this database. (CRAN grew from 1700 contributed packages
and bundles on 2009-03-11 to 1954 on 2009-09-18, adding over 40 packages
per day, an annual growth rate of 31 percent.)

The `print` method for objects of class `"findFn"` displays the results
as a table in a web browser with links to the individual help pages,
sorted by package, displaying the results from the package with the most
matches first. This behaviour differs from that of the `RSiteSearch`
function in the *utils* package in more ways than the sort order. First,
`findFn` returns the results in R as a data frame, which can be further
manipulated. Second, the ultimate display in a web browser is a table,
unlike the list produced by `RSiteSearch`.

Other [*sos*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=sos) functions provide
summaries with one line for each package, support the union and
intersection of `"findFn"` objects, and translate a `"findFn"` object
into an Excel file with three sheets: (1) **PackageSum2**, which
provides an enhanced summary of the packages with matches, (2) the
**findFn** table itself, and (3) the **call** used to produce it.

Three examples are considered below: First we find a data set containing
a variable `Petal.Length`. Second, we study R capabilities for splines,
including looking for a function named `spline`. Third, we search for
contributed R packages with capabilities for solving differential
equations.

# Finding a variable in a data set

@JC09 [pp. 282-283] uses a variable `Petal.Length` from a famous Fisher
data set but without naming the data set nor indicating where it can be
found nor even if it exists in any contributed R package. The sample
code he provides does not work by itself. To get his code to work to
produce his Figure 7.2, we must first obtain a copy of this famous data
set in a format compatible with his code.

To look for this data set, one might first try the `help.search`
function. Unfortunately, this function returns nothing in this case:

``` r
> help.search('Petal.Length')
No help files found ...
```

When this failed, many users might then try
`RSiteSearch(‘Petal.Length’)`. This produced 80 matches when it was
tried one day (and 62 matches a few months later).
`RSiteSearch(‘Petal.Length’, ‘function’)` will identify only the help
pages. We can get something similar and for many purposes more useful,
as follows:

``` r
> library(sos)
> PL <- findFn('Petal.Length')
```

`PL` is a data frame of class `"findFn"` identifying all the help pages
in Jonathan Baron's data base matching the search term. An alias for
`findFn` is `???`, and this same search can be performed as follows:

``` r
> PL <- ???Petal.Length
```

(The `???` alias only works in an assignment, so to print immediately,
you need something like `(PL <- ???Petal.Length)`.)

This data frame has columns `Count`, `MaxScore`, `TotalScore`,
`Package`, `Function`, `Date`, `Score`, `Description`, and `Link`.
`Function` is the name of the help page, not the name of the function,
as multiple functions may be documented on a single help page, and some
help pages document other things such as data sets. `Score` is the index
of the strength of the match. It is used by Baron's search engine to
decide which items to display first. `Package` is the name of the
package containing `Function`. `Count` gives the total number of matches
in `Package` found in this `findFn` call. By default, the `findFn`
object is sorted by `Count`, `MaxScore`, `TotalScore`, and `Package` (to
place the most important `Package` first), then by `Score` and
`Function`.

The `summary` method for such an object prints a table giving for each
`Package` the `Count` (number of matches), `MaxScore` (max of `Score`),
`TotalScore` (sum of `Score`), and `Date`, sorted like a Pareto chart to
place the `Package` with the most help pages first:

``` r
> # the following table has been
> # manually edited for clarity
> summary(PL)

Total number of matches: 27
Downloaded 27 links in 14 packages.
Packages with at least 1 match using search
                      pattern 'Petal.Length':
Package Count MaxScore TotalScore       Date
yaImpute    8        1          8 2009-08-16
<...>
datasets    1        2          2 2009-07-09
<...>
```

(The `Date` here is the date that this package was added to Baron's
database.)

One of the listed packages is *datasets*. Since it is part of the
default R distribution, we decide to look there first. We can select
that row of PL just like we would select a row from any other data
frame:

``` r
> PL[PL$Package == 'datasets', 'Function']
[1] iris
```

Problem solved in less than a minute! Any other method known to the
present authors would have taken substantially more time.

# Finding packages with spline capabilities

Almost four years ago, the lead author of this article decided he needed
to learn more about splines. A literature search began as follows:

``` r
> RSiteSearch('spline')
```

(using the `RSiteSearch` function in the *utils* package). While
preparing this manuscript, this command identified 1526 documents one
day. That is too many. It can be restricted to functions as follows:

``` r
> RSiteSearch('spline', 'fun')
```

This identified only 739 one day (631 a few months earlier). That's an
improvement over 1526 but is still too many. To get a quick overview of
these 739, we can proceed as follows:

``` r
> splinePacs <- findFn('spline')
```

This downloaded a summary of the 400 highest-scoring help pages in the
'RSiteSearch' data base in roughly 5-15 seconds, depending on the speed
of the Internet connection. To get all 739 matches, increase the
`maxPages` argument from its default 20:

``` r
> splineAll <- findFn('spline',
+     maxPages = 999)
```

If we want to find a function named `spline`, we can proceed as follows:

``` r
> selSpl <- (splineAll[, 'Function'] ==
+    'spline')
> splineAll[selSpl, ]
```

This has 0 rows, because there is no help page named `spline`. This does
not mean that no function with that exact name exists, only that no help
page has that name.

To look for help pages whose name includes the characters `spline`, we
can use `grepFn`:

``` r
> grepFn('spline', splineAll,
+     ignore.case = TRUE)
```

This returned a `"findFn"` object identifying 78 help pages. When this
was run while preparing this manuscript, the sixth row was `lspline` in
the *assist* package, which has a `Score` of 1. (On another day, the
results could be different, because CRAN changes over time.) This was
the sixth row in this table, because it is in the *assist* package,
which had a total of 34 help pages matching the search term, but this
was the only one whose name matched the `pattern` passed to `grepFn`.

We could next `print` the `splineAll` `"findFn"` object. However, it may
not be easy to digest a table with 739 rows.

`summary(splineAll)` would tell us that the 739 help pages came from 191
different packages and display the first `minPackages = 12` such
packages. (If other packages had the same number of matches as the
twelfth package, they would also appear in this summary.)

A more complete view can be obtained in MS Excel format using the
`writeFindFn2xls` function:

``` r
> writeFindFn2xls(splineAll)
```

(`findFn2xls` is an alias for `writeFindFn2xls`. We use the longer
version here, as it may be easier to remember.)

If either the [*WriteXLS*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=WriteXLS)
package and compatible Perl code are properly installed or if you are
running Windows with the
[*RODBC*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=RODBC) package, this
produces an Excel file in the working directory named `splineAll.xls`,
containing the following three worksheets:

-   The **PackageSum2** sheet includes one line for each package with a
    matching help page, enhanced by providing information for locally
    installed packages not available in the `"findFn"` object.
-   The **findFn** sheet contains the search results.
-   The **call** sheet gives the call to `findFn` that generated these
    search results.

If `writeFindFn2xls` cannot produce an Excel file with your
installation, it will write three `csv` files with names
`splineAll-sum.csv`, `splineAll.csv`, and `splineAll-call.csv`,
corresponding to the three worksheets described above. (Users who do not
have MS Excel may like to know that Open Office Calc can open a standard
`xls` file and can similarly create such files [@CALC09MAN].)

The **PackageSum2** sheet is created by the `PackageSum2` function,
which adds information from installed packages not obtained by `findFn`.
The extended summary includes the package title and date, plus the names
of the author and the maintainer, the number of help pages in the
package, and the name(s) of any vignettes. This can be quite valuable in
prioritizing packages for further study. Other things being equal, we
think most people would rather learn how to use a package being actively
maintained than one that has not changed in five years. Similarly, we
might prefer to study a capability in a larger package than a smaller
one, because the rest of the package might provide other useful tools or
a broader context for understanding the capability of interest.

These extra fields, package title, etc., are blank for packages in the
`"findFn"` object not installed locally. For installed packages, the
`Date` refers to the *packaged* date rather than the date the package
was added to Baron's database.

Therefore, the value of `PackageSum2` can be increased by running
`install.packages` (from the *utils* package) to install packages not
currently available locally and `update.packages()` to ensure the local
availability of the latest versions for all installed packages.

To make it easier to add desired packages, the
[*sos*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=sos) package includes an
`installPackages` function, which checks all the packages in a
`"findFn"` object for which the number of matches exceeds a second
argument `minCount` and installs any of those not already available
locally; the default `minCount` is the square root of the largest
`Count`. Therefore, the results from `PackageSum2` and the
**PackageSum2** sheet created by `writeFindFn2xls` will typically
contain more information after running `installPackages` than before.

To summarize, three lines of code gave us a very powerful summary of
spline capabilities in contributed R packages:

``` r
splineAll <- findFn('spline', maxPages = 999)
installPackages(splineAll)
writeFindFn2xls(splineAll)
```

The resulting `splineAll.xls` file can help establish priorities for
further study of the different packages and functions. An analysis of
this nature almost four years ago led the lead author to the
[*fda*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=fda) package and its
companion books, which further led to a collaboration that has produced
joint presentations at three different conferences and a joint book
[@RHG09].

# Combining search results

The lead author of this article recently gave an invited presentation on
"Fitting Nonlinear Differential Equations to Data in R"[^1]. A key part
of preparing for that presentation was a search of contributed R code,
which proceeded roughly as follows:

``` r
> de <- findFn('differential equation')
> des <- findFn('differential equations')
> de. <- de | des
```

The object `de` has 53 rows, while `des` has 105. If this search engine
were simply searching for character strings, `de` would be larger than
`des`, rather than the other way around. The last object `de.` is the
union of `de` and `des`; `|` is an alias for `unionFindFn`. The
`de.` object has 124 rows, which suggests that the corresponding
intersection must have (53+105-124) = 34. This can be confirmed via
`nrow(de & des)`. (`&` is an alias for `intersectFindFn`.)

To make everthing in `de.` locally available, we can use
`installPackages(de., minCount = 1)`. This installed all referenced
packages except `rmutil` and a dependency `Biobase`, which were not
available on CRAN but are included in Jonathan Baron's R Site Search
data base.

Next, `writeFindFn2xls(de.)` produced a file `de..xls` in the working
directory. (The working directory can be identified via `getwd()`.)

The **PackageSum2** sheet of that Excel file provided a quick summary of
packages with matches, sorted to put the package with the most matches
first. In this case, this first package was
[*deSolve*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=deSolve), which provides,
"General solvers for initial value problems of ordinary differential
equations (ODE), partial differential equations (PDE) and differential
algebraic equations (DAE)". This is clearly quite relevant to the
subject. The second package was
[*PKfit*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=PKfit), which is "A Data
Analysis Tool for Pharmacokinetics". This may be too specialized for
general use. I therefore would not want to study this first unless my
primary interest here was in pharmacokinetic models.

By studying the summary page in this way, I was able to decide
relatively quickly which packages I should consider first. In making
this decision, I gave more weight to packages with one or more vignettes
and less weight to those where the `Date` was old, indicating that the
code was not being actively maintained and updated. I also checked the
conference information to make sure I did not embarrass myself by
overlooking a package authored or maintained by another invited speaker.

# Discussion

We have found `findFn` in the
[*sos*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=sos) package to be very
quick, efficient and effective for finding things in contributed
packages. The `grepFn` function helps quickly look for functions (or
help pages) with particular names. The capabilities in `unionFindFn` and
`intersectFindFn` (especially via their `|` and `&` aliases) can be
quite useful where a single search term seems inadequate; they make it
easy to combine multiple searches to produce something closer to what is
desired. An example of this was provided with searching for both
"differential equation" and "differential equations".

The **PackageSum2** sheet of an Excel file produced by `writeFindFn2xls`
(after also running the `installPackages` function) is quite valuable
for understanding the general capabilities available for a particular
topic. This could be of great value for authors to find what is already
available so they don't duplicate something that already exists and so
their new contributions appropriately consider the contents of other
packages.

The `findFn` capability can also reduce the risk of "the researcher's
nightmare" of being told after substantial work that someone else has
already done it.

Users of [*sos*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=sos) may also wish
to consult Crantastic (<http://www.crantastic.org/>), which allows users
to tag, rate, and view packages. (The coverage of Crantastic includes
current and orphaned CRAN packages, while [@JB09URL] also includes 'most
of the default packages from Bioconductor and all of Jim Lindsey's
packages.')

# Acknowledgments

The capabilities described here extend the power of the R Site Search
search engine maintained by Jonathan Baron. Without Prof. Baron's
support, it would not have been feasible to develop the features
described here. Duncan Murdoch, Marc Schwarz, Dirk Eddelbuettel, Gabor
Grothendiek and anonymous referees contributed suggestions for
improvement, but of course can not be blamed for any deficiencies. The
collaboration required to produce the current
[*sos*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=sos) package was greatly
facilitated by R-Forge [@RFORGE09URL]. The
[*sos*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=sos) package is part of the R
Site Search project hosted there. This project also includes code for a
Firefox extension to simplify the process of finding information about R
from within Firefox. This Firefox extension is still being developed
with the current version downloadable from
