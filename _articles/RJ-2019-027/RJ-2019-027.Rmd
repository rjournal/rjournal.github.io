title: 'cvcrand: A Package for Covariate-constrained Randomization and the Clustered
  Permutation Test for Cluster Randomized Trials'
abstract: The cluster randomized trial (CRT) is a randomized controlled trial in which
  randomization is conducted at the cluster level (e.g., school or hospital) and outcomes
  are measured for each individual within a cluster. Often, the number of clusters
  available to randomize is small ($\leq$ 20), which increases the chance of baseline
  covariate imbalance between comparison arms. Such imbalance is particularly problematic
  when the covariates are predictive of the outcome because it can threaten the internal
  validity of the CRT. Pair-matching and stratification are two restricted randomization
  approaches that are frequently used to ensure balance at the design stage. An alternative,
  less commonly-used restricted randomization approach is covariate-constrained randomization.
  Covariate-constrained randomization quantifies baseline imbalance of cluster-level
  covariates using a balance metric and randomly selects a randomization scheme from
  those with acceptable balance by the balance metric. It is able to accommodate multiple
  covariates, both categorical and continuous. To facilitate implementation of covariate-constrained
  randomization for the design of two-arm parallel CRTs, we have developed the *cvcrand*
  R package. In addition, *cvcrand* also implements the clustered permutation test
  for analyzing continuous and binary outcomes collected from a CRT designed with
  covariate-constrained randomization. We used a real cluster randomized trial to
  illustrate the functions included in the package.

# Introduction

Cluster randomized trials (CRTs) randomize clusters of individuals, such
as schools, hospitals or clinics [@CRT2]. The CRT design is chosen when
there are concerns of treatment contamination, when it is logistically
easier to conduct the trial using cluster randomization and when
intervention of interest is delivered at the group level
[@turner2017reviewa]. CRTs have been used in many disciplines including
social sciences, public policy, medicine and implementation science
[@CRT1].

In this paper, we focus on the two-arm parallel cluster randomized
trial. Usually, there are a total of
${n \choose n_T}=\frac{n!}{n_T!(n-n_T)!}$ ways to allocate $n_T$
clusters to the intervention arm, out of a total of $n$ clusters. For
example, in a CRT with 10 clusters, 5 of which are assigned to the
treatment arm and 5 to the control arm, there are $\binom{10}{5}=252$
unique allocations in the simple randomization space. Each allocation is
called a randomization scheme and when simple randomization is used, one
of the 252 allocations is randomly selected and implemented in the CRT.
Because it is common that there are only a limited (usually fewer than
20) number of clusters available in a CRT [@fiero2015statistical], there
may be a non-negligible chance of imbalance between arms regarding the
distribution of baseline covariates [@moulton2004covariate]. If the
covariates are predictive of the outcome, such imbalance may threaten
the internal validity, can lead to loss of power and usually requires
statistical adjustment in the analysis stage [@ivers2012allocation].

Several design strategies are available to avoid reliance only on
statistical adjustment that accounts for baseline covariate imbalance in
the analysis phase. Two most popular ones are pair-matching and
stratification [@ivers2012allocation], both of which are examples of
restricted randomization. Matching pairs of clusters according to
similarity in the baseline covariate profile (e.g., location), and
performs randomization within each pair. Stratification is similar to
matching but instead of only considering pairs of clusters, the
procedure forms strata of 2 or more clusters where each stratum includes
clusters with similar baseline covariate profiles. As with matching, the
clusters within each stratum are then randomized into the two arms and,
when there are an even number of clusters in each stratum, there is
perfect balance of strata across treatment and control arms. There are
several limitations of these procedures. The power of a pair-matched
study might decrease due to a small number of pairs and a small
correlation between the matching covariates and the outcome
[@diehr1995breaking]. Loss to follow-up of a single cluster may require
the exclusion of the matched pair in the analysis, and reduces study
power [@ivers2012allocation]. In addition, the intracluster correlation
coefficient is not easy to compute from the matched pairs
[@donner2004pitfalls; @klar1997merits; @campbell2012consort]. In a CRT
with a small number of clusters, stratified randomization is only
possible with a small number of stratification covariates. Otherwise, a
single cluster might be in a stratum and will cause an imbalance between
the arms [@ivers2012allocation]. Given that CRTs often identify and
recruit all clusters at the start of the trial, minimization, a common
restricted randomization for individually randomized trials, is rarely
applicable to CRTs. To deal with these limitations especially with a
small number of clusters and more than a few baseline covariates to
balance, alternative restricted randomization methods are necessary.

Covariate-constrained randomization is an alternative restricted
randomization procedure [@ivers2012allocation; @raab2001balance]. Unlike
matching and stratification, covariate-constrained randomization uses a
measure called a balance metric to quantify the difference in mean
covariate values between the two arms for a given randomization scheme
across all baseline covariates that we wish to balance. The simple
randomization space is then constrained by keeping the subset of
randomization schemes with which covariates are considered sufficiently
balanced by the balance metric. A final scheme is then selected from
this constrained space, and tends to exhibit better baseline balance on
average than a scheme randomly selected without constraints. Compared
with pair-matching and stratification, covariate-constrained
randomization may be preferred due to its capacity to accommodate
multiple covariates, both categorical and continuous. Further, the ICC
calculation remains unaffected under constrained randomization.

Although covariate-constrained randomization is a promising design
strategy for CRTs, it is not commonly used in practice. One possible
reason is that it requires more programming than simple randomization,
pair-matching or stratification. Therefore, to facilitate its
implementation in the design and analysis of cluster randomized trials,
we have developed the `cvrall` and `cvrcov` functions in the
[*cvcrand*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=cvcrand) package. The
`cvrall` function performs constrained randomization based on covariate
balance measured by a scalar balance metric and can assign weights to
reflect the relative importance of candidate covariates. The `cvrcov`
function performs constrained randomization based on multivariate
balance defined through each single covariate, similar to the routine
provided in @greene2017sas.

From an analysis perspective, when a CRT is designed using
covariate-constrained randomization, this design feature should be
reflected in the analysis of the individual-level outcome data collected
during the trial [@li2016evaluation; @li2017evaluation]. To do so, a
permutation-based approach can be used. The permutation test, discussed
in @gail1996design, should account for the variability within the
constrained randomization space. In other words, the resulting clustered
permutation test obtains the p-value for the treatment effect by
referencing the observed test statistics to the permutation distribution
within the constrained space. We provide the `cptest` function in the
*cvcrand* package to facilitate the implementation of this permutation
test.

# Methods

To demonstrate the utility of the *cvcrand* package, we describe the
concepts of covariate-constrained randomization and the clustered
permutation test using an example of a real cluster randomized trial
presented in @dickinson2015pragmatic. This CRT aims to compare a
collaborative centralized reminder approach with a practice-based
reminder approach for increasing the immunization rate in children aged
19 to 35 months from $16$ counties in Colorado. Each county represents a
cluster of children and eight counties are randomized to each arm. The
collaborative reminder approach depends on the joint efforts between
health department leaders and physicians to develop a centralized
notification, either using telephone or mail, for all parents whose
pre-school children are not up-to-date on immunizations. Parents from
the practice-based arm are invited to attend a web-based training for
reminder using the Colorado Immunization Information System. Although
counties are the randomization unit, the binary outcome, immunization
status, is to be measured for participating children. A list of nine
county-level covariates are collected (see Table [1](#Dickinsonraw) for
the complete list, of which income is listed twice as it is coded as
both a continuous variable and a derived categorical variable) prior to
randomization, and balance on these covariates are desired during the
randomization phase.

## Covariate-constrained randomization

Covariate-constrained randomization, henceforth referred to simply as
constrained randomization, is a promising balancing technique for
cluster randomized trials (CRTs), especially for those with a limited
number of clusters [@CRT1]. Constrained randomization usually involves
the following steps: (i) specifying the baseline covariates that one
wishes to balance; (ii) enumerating all possible randomization schemes
or randomly simulating a large number of randomization schemes within
the simple randomization space (duplicates are removed if the schemes
are randomly simulated); (iii) retaining a constrained randomization
space with a subset of schemes where sufficient balance across baseline
covariates is achieved according to some pre-specified balance metric;
(iv) randomly selecting a scheme from the constrained randomization
space for implementation.

Stratification can be viewed as a special case of constrained
randomization. For instance, we could consider stratifying on a single
binary baseline covariate, geographic location (rural or urban), for the
immunization trial introduced previously. Suppose that 6 counties are
located in the rural area and that 10 counties are located in the urban
area. Stratified randomization ensures that half of the clusters in each
stratum, defined by distinct values of the geographic location variable,
are assigned to treatment and the rest to control. If we measure balance
by the absolute differences in the average covariate values between
arms, it follows that the stratified randomization space coincides with
a constrained randomization space with zero balance scores when each
stratum contains an even number of clusters.

Constrained randomization generalizes stratification and extends
naturally to situations where there are several, possibly continuous,
baseline covariates. The generalization is featured by defining a
balance metric accommodating multiple covariates. A balance metric gives
a quantitative assessment about the balance between the two arms for
each randomization scheme, and essentially any sensible balance metric
can be used. We first develop the `cvrall` function that balances
covariates by scalar balance scores as in @raab2001balance and
@li2016evaluation [@li2017evaluation]. Suppose we wish to balance $K$
baseline covariates, either cluster attributes or individual
characteristics aggregated at the cluster level (dummy variables are
used for categorical covariates). We denote $n$ as the total number of
clusters, $n_T$, $n_C$ as the number of treated and control clusters
(i.e., $n=n_T+n_C$), $x_{ik}$ as the $k$th covariate ($k=1,\ldots,K$) of
cluster $i$. The $l2$ balance metric, first introduced by
@raab2001balance, can be written as
$$\label{BSOL2}
B_{(l2)}=\sum_{k=1}^{K}\omega_k\left(\bar{x}_{Tk}-\bar{x}_{Ck}\right)^2   (\#eq:BSOL2)$$
where $\bar{x}_{Tk}=\sum_{i=1}^{n_T}x_{ik}/n_T$ and
$\bar{x}_{Ck}=\sum_{i=n_T+1}^{n}x_{ik}/n_C$ are the means of the $k$th
cluster-level variable in the treatment arm and the control arm,
respectively, and $\omega_{k}$ is a pre-determined weight for the $k$th
variable. We choose $\omega_{k}$ to be the inverse of the variance of
the $k$th variable across all clusters following @raab2001balance and
@li2016evaluation, namely
$$\omega_k={1}/{s_k^2}=\frac{n-1}{\sum_{i=1}^n\left(x_{ik}-\bar{x}_k\right)^2}$$
where $\bar{x}_k=\sum_{i=1}^nx_{ik}/n$.

An alternative $l1$ balance metric was introduced by @li2017evaluation
as
$$\label{BSOL1}
B_{(l1)}=\sum_{k=1}^{K}\tilde{\omega}_k\left|\bar{x}_{Tk}-\bar{x}_{Ck}\right|   (\#eq:BSOL1)$$
where the notations are consistent with the $l2$ metric except for the
weight $\tilde{\omega}_k$, which is chosen to be the inverse of the
standard deviation of the $k$th variable, $s_k$. It has been shown that
the two balance metrics perform similarly in constrained randomization,
that both metrics are invariant to affine transformation of baseline
covariates [@li2016evaluation; @li2017evaluation], and that the
resulting balance scores are free of the unit used to measure the
baseline covariates as long as the unit of measurement is consistent
across clusters. Finally, after the randomization schemes are enumerated
or simulated, we simultaneously compute the balance scores for all
schemes according to either the $l1$ or $l2$ metric, using the matrix
formula given in @li2017evaluation. We refer the reader to Web Appendix
B of @li2017evaluation for additional computational details.

To reflect the relative importance of different covariates, one may
specify different weights in the $l1$ and $l2$ balance metric. To do so,
we can modify the $l2$ balance metric to be
$$\label{mBSOL2}
B_{(l2)}=\sum_{k=1}^{K}d_k\omega_k\left(\bar{x}_{Tk}-\bar{x}_{Ck}\right)^2   (\#eq:mBSOL2)$$
where $d_k$ is the user-defined weight for the $k$th variable. By
default, $d_k=1$ for all variables and equation (\@ref(eq:mBSOL2))
reduces to equation (\@ref(eq:BSOL2)). When researchers consider a
certain variable to be more "important\" (in terms of prognostic value)
than the others, a large user-defined weight $d_k>1$ could be assigned
to that variable when assessing the balance scores. Similarly, we modify
the $l1$ balance metric by allowing for user-defined weights as
$$\label{mBSOL1}
B_{(l1)}=\sum_{k=1}^{K}d_k\widetilde{\omega}_k\left|\bar{x}_{Tk}-\bar{x}_{Ck}\right|   (\#eq:mBSOL1)$$

Another important element of constrained randomization is the cutoff
value, which we denote by $q\in (0,1]$. If we write $F_B$ as the
empirical cumulative distribution function of the balance scores
calculated using a balance metric, we could define the cutoff value as
the percentile such that the constrained space contains schemes with
balance scores no larger than $F_B^{-1}(q)$. Intuitively, the cutoff
value measures the proportion of schemes relative to the simple
randomization space. When $q=1$, there is no constraint and simple
randomization is implemented. When $q<1$, only a subset of schemes with
sufficient balance will be retained and constrained randomization is
implemented. In the immunization trial example, we have in total
${16\choose 8}=12,870$ possible randomization schemes to allocate 8
clusters each to intervention and control. If we set $q=0.1$, the
constrained randomization space contains around $1288$ schemes, allowing
for ties in the balance scores.

Ideally, the cutoff value $q$ should be small and away from $1$ so that
only the "more balanced\" randomization schemes are retained in the
constrained space. In fact, the power of statistical inference on the
intervention effect tends to increase as $q$ decreases if prognostic
covariates are balanced by constrained randomization. However, the
cutoff value $q$ should not be too small since this may risk
deterministic allocation of clusters into arms [@moulton2004covariate],
and may prohibit permutation inference given a fixed type I error rate
[@li2016evaluation]. In addition, the relationship between $q$ and power
is not monotone since power may stabilize once $q<0.1$, as seen in a
number of simulations presented in @li2017evaluation. For this reason,
we set the default cutoff value of $q=0.1$ in `cvrall`, unless specified
otherwise by the user. Finally, we note that in our `cvrall` function,
one could also specify the exact number of schemes kept in the
constrained randomization instead of the cutoff quantile value, through
the `numschemes` argument.

In addition to constraining the randomization space via a scalar summary
score, we further developed the `cvrcov` function to implement
constrained randomization with baseline balance defined directly through
each covariate. This covariate-by-covariate constrained randomization
places separate constraints on each covariate and ensures that the final
allocation scheme satisfies marginal balance of each covariate. In
particular, we follow the routine developed by @greene2017sas and
constrain the arm mean difference (or arm total difference) to be no
larger than a pre-specified value or a certain percentage of overall
mean (or mean arm total). The covariate-by-covariate balance allows
user-specified constraints on different covariates and is more flexible,
but simulating the constrained randomization space usually requires more
computations since the balance metric does not reduce to simple forms as
the $l1$ or $l2$ scores.

To better understand the constrained randomization space, we also
include a check on the randomization validity [@bailey1987valid].
Constraining the randomization may induce linkage or correlation between
clusters so that certain pairs of clusters may always be allocated to
the same arm (cluster coincidence) or never be allocated to the same arm
(cluster separation), both of which lead to loss of randomization
validity. To assess the degree of loss of validity, the `cvrall` and
`cvrcov` functions provide summary statistics on cluster pairs that
always or never appear together in the same arm, similar to the routine
by @greene2017sas. Such descriptive statistics may inform the
appropriate selection of a constrained space.

Finally, enumerating all possible schemes in the entire simple
randomization space may be computationally demanding, when there are
quite a few clusters to randomize (e.g., more than 20). In that case,
the `cvrall` and `cvrcov` functions in our package will randomly
simulate a large number of randomization schemes and remove duplicates
if any. By default, this large number is set to be 50,000, unless
specified otherwise by the user through the `size` option. With this
default setting, when the total number of schemes in the simple
randomization space is no greater than 50,000, the enumeration method
will be used. Otherwise, 50,000 schemes will be randomly simulated from
the simple randomization space and duplicates will be removed to
approximate the simple randomization space.

## Clustered permutation test

After using constrained randomization in the design of a CRT, a
permutation test can be used to test the intervention effect. We
implement the clustered permutation test used in @gail1996design and
@li2016evaluation in the `cptest` function. Specifically, we denote the
outcome of the $j$th individual ($j=1,\ldots,m_i$) from the $i$th
cluster ($i=1,\ldots,n$) as $Y_{ij}$. During the analysis stage,
researchers may wish to adjust for baseline covariates, which we denote
by a vector $\textbf{z}_{ij}$. The choice of adjustment variables may
vary from study to study, and often depends on expert knowledge.
Generally, it is a good practice to adjust for variables with high
prognostic values that are already balanced by constrained
randomization. For the permutation test, such a recommendation is not
mandatory since the test size remains valid as long as the permutation
distribution is obtained from the constrained randomization space
[@li2016evaluation], even though adjusting for prognostic variables
improves the test power [@li2016evaluation; @li2017evaluation]. However,
if one prefers an unadjusted test, the following permutation inference
still holds by setting $\textbf{z}_{ij}$ as the null or empty vector.

The permutation test is implemented in a two-step procedure. In the
first step, an outcome regression model is fitted for response $Y_{ij}$
with covariates $\textbf{z}_{ij}$. This is often done by fitting a
linear regression model for continuous responses and a logistic
regression model for binary responses, ignoring the clustering of
responses. We then compute the predicted response for each individual by
$\hat{Y}_{ij}$, which could be used to calculate the individual residual
$r_{ij}=Y_{ij}-\hat{Y}_{ij}$. In the second step, cluster-specific
residual averages are obtained as
$\bar{r}_{i\cdot}=\sum_{j=1}^{m_i}r_{ij}/m_i$. The observed test
statistic is then computed as
$$\label{CPT}
U=\frac{1}{n_T}\sum_{i=1}^nW_i\bar{r}_{i\cdot}-
\frac{1}{n_C}\sum_{i=1}^n\left(1-W_i\right)\bar{r}_{i\cdot}   (\#eq:CPT)$$
where $W_i=1$ if the $i$th cluster is assigned to the treatment arm and
$W_i=0$ otherwise, and $n_T=\sum_{i=1}^nW_i$, $n_C=\sum_{i=1}^n(1-W_i)$
are the number of treated and control clusters.

Suppose there are $S$ randomization schemes in the constrained
randomization space. To obtain the permutation distribution of the test
statistic, we permute the labels of the treatment indicator according to
the constrained randomization space, and recompute a value for $U_s$
($s=1,\ldots,S$) based on equation (\@ref(eq:CPT)). The collection of
these values $\{U_s:s=1,\ldots,S\}$ forms the null distribution of the
permutation test statistic. The p-value is then computed by
$$\label{CPTSIG}
\text{p-value}=\frac{1}{S}\sum_{s=1}^S \mathbb{I}\left(|U_s|\geq |U|\right)   (\#eq:CPTSIG)$$
where $\mathbb{I}$ is the indicator function that equals 1 when
$|U_s|\geq |U|$ and 0 otherwise.

# Illustrative Examples

## Constrained randomization by `cvrall`

We used the `cvrall` function to perform constrained randomization based
on the CRT data published in @dickinson2015pragmatic. To focus ideas, we
selected five variables in Table [1](#Dickinsonraw) to balance in the
design stage. These variables include `location` (categorical), `inciis`
(continuous), `uptodateonimmunizations` (continuous) and `hispanic`
(continuous). We further considered `incomecat` as a categorical
variable to illustrate the use of `cvrall` in the presence of a factor
variable. Of note, the `cvrall` function automatically converts the
categorical variables into dummy variables when implementing the
constrained randomization. For instance, here we categorized the
county-level covariate `incomecat` into three levels based on sample
tertiles: "low", "medium", and "high". Two dummy variables are then
introduced to represent these three categories. The "high\" level is by
default considered as the reference level by alphanumerical order of the
first letter. Similarly, when the permutation test is executed in the
`cptest` function, each categorical covariates will be transformed into
dummy variables before performing the analysis as well. It is also
important to point out that there is more than one way to define dummy
variables because any one of the levels of the categorical variable
could be chosen as the reference level. In the `cvrall` function, if the
variable is not specified as a factor with a specific reference level,
we defined the reference level to be the first level by alphanumerical
order. However, if one would like to specify other reference levels, it
is possible to preprocess the data to manually create dummy variables
before invoking the `cvrall` routines, or to specify the variables as
factors with the specific reference levels.

In this trial, we would like to randomize 8 counties into the arm with a
collaborative centralized reminder approach and 8 into the other arm
with a practice-based approach. So we specified `ntotal_cluster = 16`
and `ntrt_cluster = 8` for the total number of clusters and the number
of clusters in the treatment arm. Since the total number of possible
schemes is $\binom{16}{8}=12,870$, which is less than the default
maximum number of simulated schemes (50,000), we enumerated all 12,870
schemes. The example syntax of the function is given as the following,
where the `x=` argument references the data frame of the covariates that
will be used in the calculation of balance scores and hence be balanced
by constrained randomization.

``` r
 Design_result <- cvrall(clustername = Dickinson_design$county,
                          balancemetric = "l2",
                          x = data.frame(Dickinson_design[ , c("location", "inciis",
                              "uptodateonimmunizations", "hispanic", "incomecat")]),
                          ntotal_cluster = 16,
                          ntrt_cluster = 8,
                          categorical = c("location", "incomecat"),
                          savedata = "dickinson_constrained.csv",
                          bhist = TRUE,
                          cutoff = 0.1,
                          seed = 12345,
                          check_validity = TRUE)
```

Here we used the balance scores calculated by the $l2$ metric as
indicated by `balancemetric = "l2"`. The cateogrical variables were
specified with `categorical = c("location", "incomecat")`. Location has
two levels: `"rural"` and code\"urban\"; the level `"rural"` is the
reference level. As income category is a three-level categorical
variable of `"low"`, `"med"`, and `"high"`, the level `"high"` is
considered as the reference level and 2 dummy variables were created.
Since we specified the cutoff value as `cutoff = 0.1`, the constrained
randomization space only included the schemes with $l2$ balance scores
less than the $10$th percentile of the balance score distribution in the
simple randomization space. Finally, we randomly sampled a scheme from
the constrained space.

![Figure 1: []{#histogram label="histogram"} Histogram of balance scores
across all 12870 schemes](histogram.png){#histogram width="100%"
alt="graphic without alt text"}

We saved the constrained randomization space in a file named
`dickinson_constrained.csv` in the current working directory. In this
file, the first column is an indicator variable of whether the scheme is
the final one selected by the program. The remaining columns records the
constrained randomization matrix; each column of the matrix corresponds
to a cluster, and each row of the matrix corresponds to an allocation
scheme coded by $1$'s and $0$'s ($1$ if the cluster is assigned to the
collaborative centralized reminder approach and $0$ if assigned to the
practice-based reminder approach). Furthermore, if simple randomization
is used, namely `cutoff = 1`, the constrained randomization matrix has
12,870 rows and 16 columns. We provide the option to save the
constrained randomization space to a local directory so that it could be
used as an input for the permutation inference during the data analysis
stage, which usually happens at a later calendar time.

To facilitate the understanding of the constrained randomization
process, we could specify `bhist = TRUE` to generate a histogram
displaying the distribution of all balance scores with a red line
indicating the cutoff value (the $10$th percentile). The sample
histogram of balance scores is in Figure [1](#histogram). The summary
statistics of the balance scores are included in the `bscores` object,
regardless of the `bhist = ` option. As indicated below, the `bscores`
object contains the cutoff value, the balance score corresponding to the
selected scheme, and other quantiles of the balance score distribution.

```

In order to be transparent about the constrained randomization
procedure, we also included additional summary messages in the following
objects: `assignment_message`, `scheme_message`,\
`cutoff_message` and `choice_message`. These objects summarize the
sample size and randomization ratio, the number of schemes used to
calculate the balance score distribution, the balance metric and cutoff
value, as well as the balance score of the selected scheme,
respectively. For example, the sample size and randomization ratio are
indicated in the following message:

``` r
> Design_result$assignment_message
[1] "You have indicated that you want to assign 8 clusters to treatment and 8 to control"
```

The final randomization scheme is included in the `allocation` object.
In addition, we also provided a data frame containing the final
randomization scheme in the `data_CR` element. The data frame includes
the covariate values for each cluster in addition to the information on
cluster allocation.

To assess whether the selected constrained randomization scheme balances
the baseline covariates, we provided a baseline table summarized under
the selected randomization scheme. The baseline table indicates that the
covariates are approximately balanced across the two arms, although more
"urban" clusters are assigned to the collaborative centralized reminder
approach. The baseline table is provided in the `baseline_table`
element, and is illustrated below.

``` r
> Design_result$baseline_table
                                          arm = 0       arm = 1
n                                               8             8
location = Urban (%)                    3 (37.5)      5 (62.5)
inciis (mean (sd))                   87.00 (6.59)  87.00 (8.45)
uptodateonimmunizations (mean (sd))  39.38 (7.65)  42.25 (9.18)
hispanic (mean (sd))                22.25 (13.77) 22.38 (12.94)
incomecat (%)
   High                                 2 (25.0)      3 (37.5)
   Low                                  3 (37.5)      2 (25.0)
   Med                                  3 (37.5)      3 (37.5)
```

Finally, we considered the validity of the randomization and used the
`check_validity =` argument to summarize the cluster coincidence
(cluster pairs assigned to the same arm) and cluster separation (cluster
pairs assigned to different arms) within the constrained space. If
`check_validity = TRUE`, we could obtain the relevant descriptive
statistics in the `cluster_coin_des` object. The four rows in this
object summarize the count and fraction of clusters appearing together,
as well as count and fraction of clusters appearing in the different
arms across the constrained randomization space. Recall that under
simple randomization, no linkage or correlation is introduced between
clusters and so each cluster pair has a $50\%$ chance to appear together
in the same arm and a $50\%$ chance to appear in different arms. With
the $0.1$ cutoff value, the cluster pairs has a $47\%$ chance to appear
in the same arm on average, which is not too distant from the reference
value $50\%$. However, there is a cluster pair that will appear in the
same arm for only about $29\%$ of the times (and appear in different
arms for $71\%$ of times), indicating some loss of validity. On the
other hand, the constrained randomization routine offered by
@greene2017sas includes default proportion values, $25\%$ and $75\%$, as
thresholds for loss of validity. That is to say, a reasonable
constrained space should ensure each cluster pair appears in the same
arm (and in different arms) for at least $25\%$ of times and at most
$75\%$ times. Our constrained randomization space satisfies this
condition.

``` r

## Stratified constrained randomization by `cvrall`

Of note, the `cvrall` function could perform constrained randomization
with a stratification factor to ensure exact balance on that
stratification factor. We still considered the above trial example, but
now we wish to perform constrained randomization within each strata
defined by the binary `location` variable. In other words, two strata of
eight counties each will be defined depending on `location`, and
constrained randomization is then performed based on the additional four
covariates within each stratum. Motivated by the weighted $l1$ and $l2$
metrics \@ref(eq:mBSOL2), \@ref(eq:mBSOL1), we could assign a large
weight (e.g., 1000) to `location` and ensure exact balance on that
variable, while keeping the weights for other variables as $1$
(`weights = c(1000, 1, 1, 1, 1)`). Intuitively, a large weight assigned
to a covariate sharply penalizes any imbalance of that covariate,
therefore the resulting randomization space approximates the one
obtained by stratifying on `location`. The example syntax is provided
below.

``` r
# Stratification on location, with constrained randomization on other 
# specified covariates.
Design_stratified_result <- cvrall(clustername = Dickinson_design$county,
                                    balancemetric = "l2",
                                    x = data.frame(
                                      Dickinson_design[, 
                                        c("location", "inciis",
                                          "uptodateonimmunizations", "hispanic",
                                          "incomecat")]),
                                    ntotal_cluster = 16,
                                    ntrt_cluster = 8,
                                    categorical = c("location", "incomecat"),
                                    weights = c(1000, 1, 1, 1, 1),
                                    cutoff = 0.1,
                                    seed = 12345)
```

Depending on the choice of `cutoff` value, the above syntax may not lead
to a randomization space exactly the same as the one obtained after
stratifying on `location`. The `cvrall` function also allows one to
directly stratify on the `location` variable using the `stratify`
option, as shown next. We omitted the baseline covariate table obtained
from stratified constrained randomization, but just comment that final
scheme ensures exact balance on the `location` variable so that each arm
has now 4 urban counties and 4 rural counties.

``` r
# An alternative and equivalent way to stratify on location
Design_stratified_result <- cvrall(clustername = Dickinson_design$county,
                                    balancemetric = "l2",
                                    x = data.frame(
                                      Dickinson_design[ , 
                                        c("location", "inciis",
                                          "uptodateonimmunizations", "hispanic",
                                          "incomecat")]),
                                    ntotal_cluster = 16,
                                    ntrt_cluster = 8,
                                    categorical = c("location", "incomecat"),
                                    stratify = "location",
                                    cutoff = 0.1,
                                    seed = 12345)
```

## Constrained randomization by `cvrcov`

We additionally provided the `cvrcov` function to perform
covariate-by-covariate constrained randomization, similar to the routine
provided by @greene2017sas. This approach is particularly attractive for
its flexibility in directly balancing each covariate. We still
considered our example trial where we randomized 8 counties into the
each arm for illustration. We specified `ntotal_cluster = 16` and
`ntrt_cluster = 8` for the total number of clusters and the number of
clusters in the treatment arm. Since the total number of possible
schemes is $\binom{16}{8}=12,870$, which is less than the default
maximum number of simulated schemes (`50,000`), we enumerated all 12870
schemes.

As the covariate-by-covariate constrained randomization acts on the
numeric values of each variable, we transformed the values of the
`location` to be numeric with `"Rural"` being `1` and `"Urban"` being
`0`. For illustrative purposes, we also used the numeric average income
values rather than its categories in this example. The `x = ` argument
points to the data frame containing the covariates that will be balanced
by constrained randomization routine.

::: {#syntax}
  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  **Syntax**   **Explanation**
  ------------ -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  `any`        no constraints, any arm means or arm totals are acceptable

  `s5`         arm totals must differ in absolute value by no more than $5$

  `sf.5`       arm totals must differ in absolute value by no more than $0.5$ times the mean arm total

  `m10`        arm means must differ in absolute value by no more than 10

  `mf0.2`      arm means must differ in absolute value by no more than $0.2$ times the overall mean

  `mf.5`       arm means must differ in absolute value by no more than $0.5$ times the overall mean
  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  : Table 2: Example syntax of balancing constraints.
:::

The `cvrcov` function works the same way as the `cvrall` function,
except for that the former requires additional syntax to specify the
balancing constraints for each covariate. The syntax used to balance
each covariate is the same those used in @greene2017sas. Specifically,
if the first letter is specified as `m`, the balancing constraint acts
on means, whereas if the first letter is `s`, the balancing constraint
acts on sums or totals. If the second letter is `f`, the balancing
constraint will be compared to a fractional of a population quantity
(overall mean or mean arm total), otherwise the constraint will be
compared to an actual value. A numeric constraint will follow the
specified letters and indicates the tightness of the constraint.
Additional examples are provided in Table [2](#syntax).

``` r
Dickinson_design_numeric <- Dickinson_design
Dickinson_design_numeric$location = (Dickinson_design$location == "Rural") * 1

Design_cov_result <- cvrcov(clustername = Dickinson_design_numeric$county,
			    x = data.frame(Dickinson_design_numeric[ , c("location", "inciis",
			    					 "uptodateonimmunizations",
			   					  "hispanic", "income")]),
			    ntotal_cluster = 16,
			    ntrt_cluster = 8,
			    constraints = c("s5", "mf.5", "any", "mf0.2", "mf0.2"),
			    categorical = c("location"),
			    savedata = "dickinson_cov_constrained.csv",
			    seed = 12345,
			    check_validity = TRUE)
```

We specified `constraints = c("s5", "mf.5", "any", "mf0.2", "mf0.2")`
for the five covariates respectively. As indicated above, `s5` indicates
that the allocation scheme should ensure that the arm totals differ in
absolute value by no more than 5. Synaxt `mf.5` indicates that the
allocation scheme should ensure that the arm means differ by no more
than $0.5$ times the overall mean for `inciis`, among others. We saved
the resulting constrained randomization space as
`dickinson_cov_constrained.csv`.

Similar to `cvrall`, the `cvrcov` routine included additional summary
messages in the following objects: `assignment_message` and
`scheme_message`. These two objects summarize the sample size and
randomization ratio, the number of schemes enumerated or simulated
before applying the constraints. In addition, a data frame containing
the selected final allocation scheme is saved in the `data_CR` element
as follows.

```

To evaluate whether the selected constrained randomization scheme
balances the baseline covariates, we provided a baseline table
summarized under the that selected randomization scheme. The baseline
table indicates that the covariates are well balanced across the two
arms, with an equal number of "urban\" clusters assigned to each
reminder approach.

``` r

The `cvrcov` function permits the check of randomization validity
[@bailey1987valid], and summarizes the cluster coincidence and
separation statistics in the `cluster_coin_des` object. The result
indicates that all cluster pairs appear together in the same arm at
least $37\%$ and at most $55\%$ of the times across the constrained
randomization space. Using the $25\%$ and $75\%$ threshold, the summary
statistics indicate that the constrained randomization does not severely
depart from validity. Finally, the `cvrcov` function summarizes the
information of the constrained space in the `overall_allocations` and
`overall_summary` objects, which are suppressed here due to limited
space. In short, the summary information informs that the there are in
total 12,870 allocations and 5,776 ($\approx$ 45%) satisfied the
balancing constraints.

## Clustered permutation test by `cptest`

Since the immunization study is an ongoing trial, we used simulated
outcome data to demonstrate the clustered permutation test with the
above example where constrained randomization was performed using
`cvrall` based on the 5 covariates (the selected scheme had a balance
score of 6.764). The same syntax applies to the constrained
randomization results obtained from `cvrcov` and so is not considered
further here. Suppose that the researchers were able to assess 300
children in each county, and the trial is randomized according to the
selected final scheme. For illustration, we chose the covariates to be
adjusted in the test $\textbf{z}_{ij}$ as the list of covariates $x_i$
balanced by design. This step is in line with the recommendation of
@li2017evaluation that adjusting for prognostic factors in the analysis
improves the test power.

To generate the correlated binary outcome of whether the children is
eventually up-to-date on immunizations (`1`) or not (`0`), we used a
generalized linear mixed model (GLMM) with a logistic link to induce
correlation by including a random intercept at the county level. The
intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) is usually used to quantify the
degree of association between individual outcomes in a cluster (county).
We used the latent response definition of binary ICC defined by variance
components in the GLMM [@eldridge2009intra]. The ICC was set to be 0.01,
which is a reasonable value for population health studies
[@hannan1994parameters]. The outcome variable depends on the
county-level covariates used in performing the constrained
randomization, as previously mentioned, and we simulated a treatment
effect so that the collaborative reminder approach increases up-to-date
immunization rates compared to the practice-based reminder approach
(odds ratio equals to $e^{0.5}\approx 1.649$). The binary outcome for
each individual child is generated from a Bernoulli model with event
probability specified by the GLMM.

We performed the clustered permutation test using the `cptest` function
for the binary outcome of the status of up-to-date on immunizations. As
indicated in @li2016evaluation, valid permutation test under constrained
randomization should only shuffle the treatment label within the
constrained space, and so it is important to save and input the
constrained randomization space in the design stage (the file named
`dickinson_constrained.csv`). The permutation test is performed by first
regressing the outcome on the five covariates, `inciis`,
`uptodateonimmunizations`, `hispanic`, `location`, and `incomecat`. As
the last two covariates are categorical, the `cptest()` function creates
dummy variables and set reference levels according to alphanumerical
order, matching the steps in `cvrall`. Of note, had different reference
levels been selected for the constrained randomization design procedure,
the corresponding dummy coding should be reflected in the analysis phase
when the clustered permutation test is used. We specified `outcometype`
to be "binary" so that logistic regression is performed to compute the
residuals. An example syntax of the function is given as follows.

``` r
 Analysis_result <- cptest(outcome = Dickinson_outcome$outcome,
                           clustername = Dickinson_outcome$county,
                           z = data.frame(Dickinson_outcome[, c("location", "inciis",
                               "uptodateonimmunizations", "hispanic", "incomecat")]),
                           cspacedatname = "dickinson_constrained.csv",
                           outcometype = "binary",
                           categorical = c("location","incomecat"))
```

The covariates to be adjusted for in the permutation test is indicated
in the `z = ` option, which matches the covariate matrix used in
`cvrall` for constrained randomization. If one wishes to an unadjusted
permutation test, one could leave out the `z = ` option as it is an
optional argument. The output of `Analysis_result` includes the final
scheme selected by design (`FinalScheme` object), the p-value of the
test (`p-value` object) and a sentence to describe the p-value
(`pvalue_statement` object). We omitted the code output here for
brevity, but comment that, in this example, the p-value equals to
`0.042`, indicating that there is a significant difference in the effect
of the interventions on the outcome of up-to-date on immunizations, if
testing is performed at the 5% significance level. Again, if the
constrained randomization is performed by `cvrcov`, we could use the
`cptest` function in a similar way once we provided the constrained
permutation matrix obtained from `cvrcov` in the `cspacedatname = `
argument.

# Summary

The *cvcrand* package contains three main functions for the design and
analysis of cluster randomized trials. Given that it is common for such
trials to enroll a small number of clusters and that this gives rise to
chance imbalance in covariates that are predictive of the outcome, the
`cvrall` and `cvrcov` functions can be used to implement
covariate-constrained randomization in the design phase to ensure better
balance. The `cvrall` function uses a balance metric to quantify balance
across multiple cluster-level covariates, whereas the `cvrcov` allows
for covariate-by-covariate balance and could potentially be more
flexible. For analysis of the individual-level outcome data collected in
the CRT, the `cptest` function could help perform the clustered
permutation test, which accommodate both continuous and binary outcomes
and should be treated as a flexible alternative to model-based analysis.

There are several limitations of the *cvcrand* package. First, the
`cvrall` and `cvrcov` only deal with two-arm parallel cluster randomized
trials and may not be directly applied to balance covariates in other
designs such as the stepped wedge designs
[@Hussey2007; @LiTurnerPreisser2018]. Second, although the `cptest`
function performs a valid analysis for individual-level outcome data
when there is an equal number of clusters per arm, the test may be
anti-conservative when there is an unequal number of clusters per arm
[@gail1996design]. Furthermore, our `cptest` routine does not provide a
confidence interval for the intervention effect estimate, and additional
programming is required to obtain a permutation confidence interval.
Essentially, the permutation test will be inverted to numerically search
for the interval limits, as is done in @gail1996design for an unadjusted
test under simple randomization. For the adjusted test under constrained
randomization, the following steps could be carried out: (i) hypothesize
an treatment effect $\delta$ on the link function scale; (ii) obtain the
residuals $r_{ij}=Y_{ij}-\hat{Y}_{ij}$, where $\hat{Y}_{ij}$ is
estimated from regressing $Y_{ij}$ on $\textbf{z}_{ij}$ and the
hypothesized treatment effect; (iii) perform the permutation test under
the constrained randomization space and obtain a p-value; (iv) repeat
steps (i)-(iii) for different values of $\delta$ and the confidence
interval is the collection of $\delta$ such that the p-value is at least
0.05. We noticed that few studies were present in the CRT literature to
evaluate the performance of permutation intervals that adjust for
covariates under constrained randomization, and this is an avenue for
future research. On the other hand, it is also important to notice that
point and interval estimates could be easily obtained from model-based
approaches, with caveats discussed in @li2016evaluation. In the class of
model-based approaches, the most commonly-used approaches are the
generalized linear mixed model (GLMM) model approach, which estimates
the cluster-specific conditional effect, and the generalized estimating
equations (GEE) approach, which estimates the population-averaged or
marginal effect [@turner2017reviewb]. In each case, it has been
demonstrated that the model-based analyses should account for the
prognostic covariates used in the design
[@li2016evaluation; @li2017evaluation]. Finally, although the `cptest`
function can handle both continuous and binary outcomes, we have not yet
extended the function to accommodate count outcomes. In summary, these
limitations reflect the current research on constrained randomization.
We plan to update the *cvcrand* package as the theory and knowledge of
these procedures develop in the future.
