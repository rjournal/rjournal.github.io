title: 'cvcrand: A Package for Covariate-constrained Randomization and the Clustered
  Permutation Test for Cluster Randomized Trials'
abstract: The cluster randomized trial (CRT) is a randomized controlled trial in which
  randomization is conducted at the cluster level (e.g., school or hospital) and outcomes
  are measured for each individual within a cluster. Often, the number of clusters
  available to randomize is small (≤ 20), which increases the chance of baseline covariate
  imbalance between comparison arms. Such imbalance is particularly problematic when
  the covariates are predictive of the outcome because it can threaten the internal
  validity of the CRT. Pair-matching and stratification are two restricted randomization
  approaches that are frequently used to ensure balance at the design stage. An alternative,
  less commonly-used restricted randomization approach is covariate-constrained randomization.
  Covariate-constrained randomization quantifies baseline imbalance of cluster-level
  covariates using a balance metric and randomly selects a randomization scheme from
  those with acceptable balance by the balance metric. It is able to accommodate multiple
  covariates, both categorical and continuous. To facilitate imple mentation of covariate-constrained
  randomization for the design of two-arm parallel CRTs, we have developed the cvcrand
  R package. In addition, cvcrand also implements the clustered permutation test for
  analyzing continuous and binary outcomes collected from a CRT designed with covariate
  constrained randomization. We used a real cluster randomized trial to illustrate
  the functions included in the package.
