title: Multivariate Subgaussian Stable Distributions in R
abstract: ' We introduce and showcase [mvpd](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=mvpd)
  (an acronym for *m*ulti*v*ariate *p*roduct *d*istributions), a package that uses
  a product distribution approach to calculating multivariate subgaussian stable distribution
  functions. The family of multivariate subgaussian stable distributions are elliptically
  contoured multivariate stable distributions that contain the multivariate Cauchy
  and the multivariate normal distribution. These distributions can be useful in modeling
  data and phenomena that have heavier tails than the normal distribution (more frequent
  occurrence of extreme values). Application areas include log returns for stocks,
  signal processing for radar and sonar data, astronomy, and hunting patterns of sharks. '
