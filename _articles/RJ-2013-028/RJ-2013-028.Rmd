title: Temporal Disaggregation of Time Series
abstract: Temporal disaggregation methods are used to disaggregate low frequency time
  series to higher frequency series, where either the sum, the average, the first
  or the last value of the resulting high frequency series is consistent with the
  low frequency series. Temporal disaggregation can be performed with or without one
  or more high frequency indicator series. The package tempdisagg is a collection
  of several methods for temporal disaggregation.
