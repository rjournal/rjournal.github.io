title: 'elhmc: An R Package for Hamiltonian Monte Carlo Sampling in Bayesian Empirical
  Likelihood'
abstract: |
  In this article, we describe an `R` package for sampling from an
  empirical likelihood-based posterior using a Hamiltonian Monte Carlo
  method. Empirical likelihood-based methodologies have been used in the
  Bayesian modeling of many problems of interest in recent times. This
  semiparametric procedure can easily combine the flexibility of a
  nonparametric distribution estimator together with the
  interpretability of a parametric model. The model is specified by
  estimating equation-based constraints. Drawing inference from a
  Bayesian empirical likelihood (BayesEL) posterior is challenging. The
  likelihood is computed numerically, so no closed-form expression of
  the posterior exists. Moreover, for any sample of finite size, the
  support of the likelihood is non-convex, which hinders fast mixing of
  many Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) procedures. It has been recently
  shown that using the properties of the gradient of the log empirical
  likelihood, one can devise an efficient Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC)
  algorithm to sample from a BayesEL posterior. The package requires the
  user to specify only the estimating equations, the prior, and their
  respective gradients. An MCMC sample drawn from the BayesEL posterior
  of the parameters, with various details required by the user, is
  obtained.

## Introduction

Empirical likelihood has several advantages over a traditional
parametric likelihood. Even though a correctly specified parametric
likelihood is usually the most efficient for parameter estimation,
semiparametric methods like empirical likelihood, which use a
nonparametric estimate of the underlying distribution, are often more
efficient when the model is misspecified. Empirical likelihood
incorporates parametric model-based information as constraints in
estimating the underlying distribution, which makes the parametric
estimates interpretable. Furthermore, it allows easy incorporation of
known additional information not involving the parameters in the
analysis.

Bayesian empirical likelihood (BayesEL) (Lazar 2003) methods employ
empirical likelihood in the Bayesian paradigm. Given some information
about the model parameters in the form of a prior distribution and
estimating equations obtained from the model, a likelihood is
constructed from a constrained empirical estimate of the underlying
distribution. The prior is then used to define a posterior based on this
estimated likelihood. Inference on the parameter is drawn based on
samples generated from the posterior distribution.

BayesEL methods are quite flexible and have been found useful in many
areas of statistics. The examples include small area estimation,
quantile regression, analysis of complex survey data, etc.

BayesEL procedures, however, require an efficient Markov Chain Monte
Carlo (MCMC) procedure to sample from the resulting posterior. It turns
out that such a procedure is not easily specified. For many parameter
values, it may not be feasible to compute the constrained empirical
distribution function, and the likelihood is estimated to be zero. That
is, the estimated likelihood is not supported over the whole space.
Moreover, this support is non-convex and impossible to determine in most
cases. Thus, a naive random walk MCMC would quite often propose
parameters outside the support and get stuck.

Many authors have encountered this problem in frequentist applications.
Such \"empty set\" problems are quite common (Grendár and Judge 2009)
and become more frequent in problems with a large number of parameters
([Bergsma et al.]{.nocase} 2012). Several authors (Chen et al. 2008;
[Emerson et al.]{.nocase} 2009; [Liu et al.]{.nocase} 2010) have
suggested the addition of extra observations generated from the
available data designed specifically to avoid empty sets. They show that
such observations can be proposed without changing the asymptotic
distribution of the corresponding Wilks' statistics. Some authors ((Tsao
2013; Tsao and Wu 2013, 2014)) have used a transformation so that the
contours of the resultant empirical likelihood could be extended beyond
the feasible region. However, in most Bayesian applications, the data
are finite in size and not large, for which the asymptotic arguments
have little use.

With the availability of user-friendly software packages like `STAN`
(Carpenter et al. 2017), gradient-assisted MCMC methods like Hamiltonian
Monte Carlo (HMC) are becoming increasingly popular in Bayesian
computation. When the estimating equations are smooth with respect to
the parameters, gradient-based methods would have a huge advantage in
sampling from a BayesEL posterior. This is because Chaudhuri et al.
(2017) have shown that under mild conditions, the gradient of the
log-posterior would diverge to infinity at the boundary of its support.
Due to this phenomenon, if an HMC chain approaches the boundary of the
posterior support, it would be reflected towards its center.

There is no software to implement HMC sampling from a BayesEL posterior
with smooth estimating equations and priors. We describe such a library
called `elhmc` written for the `R` platform. The main function in the
library only requires the user to specify the estimating equations,
prior, and respectively their Hessian and gradient with respect to the
parameters as functions. Outputs with user-specified degree of detail
can be obtained.

The package has been used by practitioners since it was made available
on . In recent times, various other libraries for sampling from a
BayesEL posterior have been made available. Among them, the library (Yu
and Lim 2024) deserves special mention. The authors compute a
variational approximation of the BayesEL posterior from which samples
can be easily drawn. However, most of the time is considered to be the
benchmark.

The rest of the article is structured as follows. We start with the
theoretical background behind the software package. In section
[2](#sec:theory){reference-type="ref" reference="sec:theory"} we first
define the empirical likelihood and construct a Bayesian empirical
likelihood from it. The next part of this section is devoted to a review
of the properties of the log empirical likelihood gradient. A review of
the HMC method with special emphasis on BayesEL sampling is provided
next (Section [2.3](#sec:hmc){reference-type="ref"
reference="sec:hmc"}). Section [3](#sec:package){reference-type="ref"
reference="sec:package"} mainly contains the description of the `elhmc`
library. Some illustrative examples with artificial and real data sets
are presented in Section [4](#sec:examples){reference-type="ref"
reference="sec:examples"}.

## Theoretical background {#sec:theory}

### Basics of Bayesian Empirical Likelihood

Suppose $x=(x_1,\ldots,x_n)\in \mathbb{R}^p$ are $n$ observations from a
distribution $F^0$ depending on a parameter vector
$\theta=(\theta^{(1)}, \ldots,\theta^{(d)})\in\Theta\subseteq \mathbb{R}^d$.
We assume that both $F^0$ and the true parameter value $\theta^0$ are
unknown. However, certain smooth functions
$g(\theta,x)=\left(g_1(\theta,x),\ldots,g_q(\theta,x)\right)^T$ are
known to satisfy
$$\begin{equation}
\label{smoothfun}
E_{F^0}[g(\theta^0,x)]=0.
\end{equation}   (\#eq:smoothfun)$$

Additionally, information about the parameter is available in the form
of a prior density $\pi(\theta)$ supported on $\Theta$. We assume that
it is neither possible nor desirable to specify $F^0$ in a parametric
form. On the other hand, it is not beneficial to estimate $F^0$
completely nonparametrically without taking into account the information
from \@ref(eq:smoothfun) in the estimation procedure.

Empirical likelihood provides a semiparametric procedure to estimate
$F^0$, by incorporating information contained in \@ref(eq:smoothfun). A
likelihood can be computed from the estimate. Moreover, if some
information about the parameter is available in the form of a prior
distribution, the same likelihood can be employed to derive a posterior
of the parameter given the observations.

Let $F\in\mathcal{F}_{\theta}$ be a distribution function depending on
the parameter $\theta$. The empirical likelihood is the maximum of the
"nonparametric likelihood\"
$$\begin{equation}
\label{eqn2}
L(F)=\prod_{i=1}^n \{F(x_i)-F(x_i-)\}
\end{equation}   (\#eq:eqn2)$$
over $\mathcal{F}_\theta$, $\theta\in\Theta$, under constraints
depending on $g(\theta,x)$.

More specifically, by defining $\omega_i=F(x_i)-F(x_i-)$, the empirical
likelihood for $\theta$ is defined by,
$$\begin{equation}
\label{eqn3}
L(\theta)\coloneqq\max_{\omega\in\mathcal{W}_{\theta}}\prod_{i=1}^n \omega_i
\end{equation}   (\#eq:eqn3)$$
where
$$\mathcal{W}_{\theta}=\Big\{\omega: \sum_{i=1}^n\omega_i g(\theta,x_i)=0\Big\}\cap\Delta_{n-1}$$
and $\Delta_{n-1}$ is the $n-1$ dimensional simplex, i.e.
$\omega_i\geq 0$, $\forall i$ and $\sum_{i=1}^n\omega_i=1$. For any
$\theta$, if the problem in \@ref(eq:eqn3) is infeasible, i.e.
$\mathcal{W}_{\theta}=\emptyset$, we define $L(\theta)\coloneqq 0$.

Using the empirical likelihood $L(\theta)$ and the prior $\pi(\theta)$
we can define a posterior as:
$$\begin{equation}
\label{eqn4}
\Pi(\theta|x)=\frac{L(\theta)\pi(\theta)}{\int L(\theta)\pi(\theta) d\theta}\propto L(\theta)\pi(\theta).
\end{equation}   (\#eq:eqn4)$$

In Bayesian empirical likelihood (BayesEL), $\Pi(\theta|x)$ is used as
the posterior to draw inferences on the parameter.

Returning back to \@ref(eq:eqn3) above, suppose we denote:
$$\begin{equation}
\label{eqn5}
\hat{\omega}(\theta)=\mathop{\mathrm{\arg\!\max}}_{\omega\in\mathcal{W}_{\theta}}\prod_{i=1}^n \omega_i.
\qquad\qquad
\Big(\text{ i.e. } L(\theta)=\prod^n_{i=1}\hat{\omega}_i(\theta)\Big)
\end{equation}   (\#eq:eqn5)$$
Each $\hat\omega_i\geq 0$ if and only if the origin in $\mathbb{R}^q$
can be expressed as a convex combination of
$g(\theta,x_1),\ldots,g(\theta,x_n)$. Otherwise, the optimisation
problem is infeasible, and $\mathcal{W}_{\theta}=\emptyset$.
Furthermore, when $\hat{\omega}_i>0$, $\forall i$ is feasible, the
solution $\hat{\omega}$ of \@ref(eq:eqn5) is unique.

The estimate of $F^0$ is given by:[^1]
$$\hat{F}^0(x)=\sum_{i=1}^n\hat{\omega}_i(\theta)1_{\{x_i\leq x\}}.$$
The distribution $\hat{F}^0$ is a step function with a jump of
$\hat{\omega}_i(\theta)$ on $x_i$. If
$\mathcal{W}_{\theta}=\Delta_{n-1}$, i.e. no information about
$g(\theta,x)$ is present, it easily follows that
$\hat{\omega}_i(\theta)=n^{-1}$, for each $i=1$, $2$, $\ldots$, $n$ and
$\hat{F}^0$ is the well-known empirical distribution function.

By construction, $\Pi(\theta|x)$ can only be computed numerically. No
analytic form is available. Inferences are drawn through the
observations from $\Pi(\theta|x)$ sampled using Markov chain Monte Carlo
techniques.

Adaptation of Markov chain Monte Carlo methods to BayesEL applications
poses several challenges. First of all, it is not possible to determine
the full conditional densities in a closed form. So techniques like
Gibbs sampling (Geman and Geman 1984) cannot be used. In most cases,
random walk Metropolis procedures, with carefully chosen step sizes, are
attempted. However, the nature of the support of $\Pi(\theta|x)$, which
we discuss in detail below, makes the choice of an appropriate step size
extremely difficult.

Provided that the prior is positive over the whole $\Theta$, which is
true in most applications, the support of $\Pi(\theta|x)$ is a subset of
the support of the likelihood $L(\theta)$ which can be defined as (see
Figure [1](#fig:scheme){reference-type="ref" reference="fig:scheme"}):
$$\begin{equation}
\label{support}
\Theta_1=\left\{\theta: L(\theta)>0\right\}.
\end{equation}   (\#eq:support)$$
Thus, the efficiency of the MCMC algorithm would depend on $\Theta_1$
and the behaviour of $\Pi(\theta|x)$ on it.

By definition, $\Theta_1$ is closely connected to the set
$$\begin{equation}
\label{convexhull}
\mathcal{C}(\theta,x)=\left\{\sum_{i=1}^n\omega_ig(\theta,x_i) \Big|\omega\in \Delta_{n-1}\right\},
\end{equation}   (\#eq:convexhull)$$
which is the closed convex hull of the $q$ dimensional vectors
$G(x,\theta)=\{g(\theta,x_i),\ldots,g(\theta,x_n)\}$ in $\mathbb{R}^q$
(the pentagon in Figure [1](#fig:scheme){reference-type="ref"
reference="fig:scheme"}). Suppose $\mathcal{C}^0(\theta,x)$ and
$\partial \mathcal{C}(\theta,x)$ are respectively the interior and
boundary of $\mathcal{C}(\theta,x)$. By construction,
$\mathcal{C}(\theta,x)$ is a convex polytope. Since the data $x$ is
fixed, the set $\mathcal{C}(\theta,x)$ is a set-valued function of
$\theta$. For any $\theta\in\Theta$, the problem in \@ref(eq:eqn3) is
feasible (i.e. $\mathcal{W}_{\theta}\ne\emptyset$) if and only if the
origin of $\mathbb{R}^q$, denoted by $0_q$, is in
$\mathcal{C}(\theta,x)$. That is, $\theta\in\Theta_1$ if and only if the
same $0_q\in\mathcal{C}^0(\theta,x)$. It is not possible to determine
$\Theta_1$ in general. The only way is to check if, for any potential
$\theta$, the origin $0_q$ is in $\mathcal{C}^0(\theta,x)$. There is no
quick numerical way to check the latter either. Generally, an attempt is
made to solve \@ref(eq:eqn3). The existence of such a solution indicates
that $\theta\in L(\theta)$.

Examples show (Chaudhuri et al. 2017) that even for simple problems,
$\Theta_1$ may not be a convex set. Designing an efficient random walk
Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm on a potentially non-convex support
is an extremely challenging task. Unless the step sizes and the proposal
distributions are adapted well to the proximity of the current position
to the boundary of $\Theta_1$, the chain may repeatedly propose values
outside the likelihood support and, as a result, converge very slowly.
Adaptive algorithms like the one proposed by Haario et al. (1999) do not
tackle the non-convexity problem well.

Hamiltonian Monte Carlo methods solve well-known equations of motion
from classical mechanics to propose new values of $\theta\in\Theta$.
Numerical solutions of these equations of motion are dependent on the
gradient of the log posterior. The norm of the gradient of the log
empirical likelihood used in BayesEL procedures diverges near the
boundary of $\Theta_1$. This property makes the Hamiltonian Monte Carlo
procedures very efficient for sampling a BayesEL posterior. It ensures
that once in $\Theta_1$, the chain would rarely step outside the support
and repeatedly sample from the posterior.

### A Review of Some Properties of the Gradient of Log Empirical Likelihood {#sec:elprop}

Various properties of log-empirical likelihood have been discussed in
the literature. However, the properties of its gradients with respect to
the model parameters are relatively unknown. Our main goal in this
section is to review the behaviour of gradients of log-empirical
likelihood on the support of the empirical likelihood. We only state the
relevant results here. The proofs of these results can be found in
Chaudhuri et al. (2017).

Recall that, (see Figure [1](#fig:scheme){reference-type="ref"
reference="fig:scheme"}) the support $\Theta_1$ can only be specified by
checking if $0_q\in\mathcal{C}^0(x,\theta_0)$ for each individual
$\theta_0\in\Theta$. If for some $\theta_0\in\Theta$, the origin lies on
the boundary of $\mathcal{C}(x,\theta_0)$, i.e.
$0_q\in\partial \mathcal{C}(x,\theta_0)$, the problem in \@ref(eq:eqn3)
is still feasible, however, $L\left(\theta_0\right)=0$ and the solution
of \@ref(eq:eqn5) is not unique. Below we discuss how, under mild
conditions, for any $\theta_0\in\Theta$, for a large subset
$S\subseteq\partial \mathcal{C}(x,\theta_0)$, if $0_q\in S$, the
absolute value of at least one component of the gradient of
$\log\left(L\left(\theta_0\right)\right)$ would be large.

Before we proceed, we make the following assumptions:

1.  $\Theta$ is an open set. []{#A0 label="A0"}

2.  $g$ is a continuously differentiable function of $\theta$ in
    $\Theta$, $q \le d$ and $\Theta_1$ is non-empty. []{#A1 label="A1"}

3.  The sample size $n > q$. The matrix $G(x, \theta)$ has full row rank
    for any $\theta \in \Theta$.

4.  For any fixed $x$, let $\nabla g(x_i,\theta)$ be the $q \times d$
    Jacobian matrix for any $\theta \in \Theta$. Suppose
    $w=(w_1,\ldots, w_n)\in\Delta_{n-1}$ and there are at least $q$
    elements of $w$ that are greater than $0$. Then, for any
    $\theta \in \Theta$, the matrix
    $\sum_{i=1}^n w_i \nabla g(x_i,\theta)$ has full row rank.

Under the above assumptions, several results about the log empirical
likelihood and its gradient can be deduced.

First of all, since the properties of the gradient of the log empirical
likelihood at the boundary of the support are of interest, some
topological properties of the support need to be investigated. Under the
standard topology of $\mathbb{R}^q$, since $\mathcal{C}(x,\theta)$ is a
convex polytope with a finite number of faces and extreme points, using
the smoothness of $g$, it is easy to see that, for any
$\theta_0\in\Theta_1$ one can find a real number $\delta>0$, such that
the open ball centred at $\theta_0$ with radius $\delta$ is contained in
$\Theta_1$. That is, $\Theta_1$ is an open subset of $\Theta$.

Now, since $\Theta_1$ is an open set, the boundary $\partial\Theta_1$ of
$\Theta_1$ is not contained in $\Theta_1$. Let $\theta^{(0)}$ lie within
$\Theta$ and on the boundary of $\Theta_1$ (i.e. $\partial\Theta_1$).
Then it follows that the primal problem \@ref(eq:eqn3) is feasible at
$\theta^{(0)}$ and $0_q$ lies on the boundary of
$\mathcal{C}(x,\theta^{(0)})$ (i.e.
$\partial \mathcal{C}(x,\theta^{(0)})$).

Our main objective is to study the utility of Hamiltonian Monte Carlo
methods for drawing samples from a BayesEL posterior. The sampling
scheme will produce a sequence of sample points in
$\theta^{(k)}\in\Theta_1$ (see Figure
[1](#fig:scheme){reference-type="ref" reference="fig:scheme"}). It would
be efficient as long as $\log L\left(\theta^{(k)}\right)$ is large. The
sampling scheme could potentially become inefficient if some
$\theta^{(k)}$ is close to the boundary $\partial\Theta_1$. Thus, it is
sufficient to consider the properties of the log empirical likelihood
and its gradient along such a sequence converging to a point
$\theta^{(0)}\in\partial\Theta_1$.

From the discussion above it is evident that when
$\theta^{(0)} \in \partial \Theta_1$ the problem in \@ref(eq:eqn3) is
feasible but the likelihood $L\left(\theta^{(0)}\right)$ will always be
zero and \@ref(eq:eqn5) will not have a unique solution. Since
$\mathcal{C}(x,\theta^{(0)})$ is a polytope, and $0_q$ lies on one of
its faces, there exists a subset $\mathcal{I}_0$ of the observations and
$0$ belongs to the interior of the convex hull generated by all
$g(x_i,\theta^{(0)})$ for $i \in \mathcal{I}_0$ (in Figure
[1](#fig:scheme){reference-type="ref" reference="fig:scheme"},
$\mathcal{I}_0=\{x_4,x_5\}$). It follows from the supporting hyperplane
theorem (Boyd and Vandenberghe 2004) that there exists a unit vector
$a\in \mathbb{R}^q$ such that
$$a^{\text{\tiny T}} g(x_i, \theta^{(0)}) =0 \quad \mbox{for} \quad i \in \mathcal{I}_0, \qquad\text{and}\qquad a^{\text{\tiny T}} g(x_{i}, \theta^{(0)}) >0 \quad \mbox{for} \quad i \in \mathcal{I}_0^c.$$
From some algebraic manipulation it easily follows that any
$\omega\in\mathcal{W}_{\theta^{(0)}}$ ($\mathcal{W}_{\theta}$ as defined
in \@ref(eq:eqn3) with $\theta=\theta^{(0)}$) must satisfy,[^2]
$$\omega_i=0 \quad \mbox{for} \quad i \in \mathcal{I}_0^c \qquad\text{and}\qquad \omega_i>0 \quad \mbox{for} \quad i \in \mathcal{I}_0.$$

It is well known that the solution of \@ref(eq:eqn5) i.e.
$\hat{w}(\theta)$ is smooth for all $\theta\in\Theta_1$ (Qin and Lawless
1994). As $\theta^{(k)}$ converges to $\theta^{(0)}$, the properties of
$\hat{w}(\theta^{(k)})$ need to be considered. To that goal, we first
make a specific choice of $\hat{w}(\theta^{(0)})$.

First, we consider a restriction of problem \@ref(eq:eqn5) to
$\mathcal{I}_0$.

$$\begin{equation}
\label{submax}
\hat\nu(\theta)  =\mathop{\mathrm{\arg\!\max}}_{\nu\in\mathcal{V}_\theta} \prod_{i\in\mathcal{I}_0} \nu_i
\end{equation}   (\#eq:submax)$$
where
$$\mathcal{V}_\theta=\left\{\nu: \sum_{i\in \mathcal{I}_0}\nu_i g(x_i,\theta)=0\right\}\cap\Delta_{|\mathcal{I}_0|-1}.$$
We now define
$$\hat  \omega_i(\theta^{(0)}) = \hat\nu(\theta^{(0)}), \quad i \in \mathcal{I}_0 \quad \mbox{and} \quad \hat  \omega_i(\theta^{(0)}) = 0, \quad i \in \mathcal{I}_0^c,$$
and
$$L(\theta^{(0)})= \prod_{i=1}^n \hat  \omega_i(\theta^{(0)}).$$

Since $\theta^{(0)}$ is in the interior of $\mathcal{I}_0$, the problem
\@ref(eq:submax) has a unique solution. For each
$\theta^{(k)}\in\Theta_1$, $\hat{\omega}(\theta^{(k)})$ is continuous
taking values in a compact set. Thus as $\theta^{(k)}$ converges to
$\theta^{(0)}$, $\hat{\omega}(\theta^{(k)})$ converges to a limit.
Furthermore, this limit is a solution of \@ref(eq:eqn5) at
$\theta^{(0)}$. However, counterexamples show (Chaudhuri et al. 2017)
that the limit may not be $\hat{\omega}_i(\theta^{(0)})$ as defined
above. That is, the vectors $\hat{\omega}(\theta^{(k)})$ do not extend
continuously to the boundary $\partial\Theta_1$ as a whole. However, we
can show that:
$$\begin{equation}
\lim_{k\to\infty}\hat\omega_i(\theta^{(k)}) = \hat \omega_i(\theta^{(0)})   = 0, \text{for all\ } i \in \mathcal{I}_0^c.
\end{equation}$$
That is, the components of $\hat\omega(\theta^{(k)})$ which are zero in
$\hat\omega(\theta^{(0)})$ are continuously extendable. Furthermore,
$$\begin{equation}
\lim_{k\to\infty}L(\theta^{(k)})=L(\theta^{(0)})=0.
\end{equation}$$
That is, the likelihood is continuous at $\theta^{(0)}$.

However, this is not true for the components
$\hat{\omega}_i\left(\theta^{(k)}\right)$, $i\in\mathcal{I}_0$ for which
$\hat{\omega}_i\left(\theta^{(k)}\right)> 0$.

Since the set $\mathcal{C}(x,\theta)$ is a convex polytope in
$\mathbb{R}^q$, the maximum dimension of any of its faces is $q-1$,
which would have exactly $q$ extreme points.[^3] Furthermore, any face
with a smaller dimension can be expressed as an intersection of such
$q-1$ dimensional faces.

In certain cases, however, the whole vector
$\hat{\omega}\left(\theta^{(k)}\right)$ extends continuously to
$\hat{\omega}\left(\theta^{(0)}\right)$. In order to argue that, we
define
$$\begin{equation}
\label{Theta_2}
  \mathcal{C}(x_{\mathcal{I}},\theta) = \left\{\sum_{i \in \mathcal{I}} \omega_i g(x_i,\theta)\, \Big|\, \omega\in \Delta_{|\mathcal{I}|-1}\right\}
\end{equation}   (\#eq:Theta-2)$$
and
$$\begin{equation}
  \partial\Theta_1^{(q-1)} = \Big\{  \theta:  0 \in  \mathcal{C}^0(x_{\mathcal{I}},\theta)  \mbox{ for some } \mathcal{I}~ s.t. \mathcal{C}(x_{\mathcal{I}},\theta)  \text{has exactly q extreme points} \Big\}  \cap\partial\Theta_1.
\end{equation}$$

Thus $\partial\Theta_1^{(q-1)}$ is the set of all boundary points
$\theta^{(0)}$ of $\Theta_1$ such that $0$ belongs to a
$(q-1)$-dimensional face of the convex hull
$\mathcal{C}(x,\theta^{(0)})$. Now for any
$\theta^{(0)}\in \partial\Theta_1^{(q-1)}$, there is a unique set of
weight $\nu\in\Delta_{|\mathcal{I}|-1}$ such that,
$\sum_{i\in\mathcal{I}}\nu_ig\left(x_i,\theta^{(0)}\right)=0$. That is
the set of feasible solutions of \@ref(eq:submax) is a singleton set.
This, after taking note that $\hat{\omega}$ takes values in a compact
set, an argument using convergent subsequences, implies that for any
sequence $\theta^{(k)}\in\Theta_1$ converging to $\theta^{(0)}$, the
whole vector $\hat{\omega}\left(\theta^{(k)}\right)$ converges to
$\hat{\omega}\left(\theta^{(0)}\right)$. That is, the whole vector
$\hat{\omega}\left(\theta^{(k)}\right)$ extends continuously to
$\hat{\omega}\left(\theta^{(0)}\right)$.

We now consider the behaviour of the gradient of the log empirical
likelihood near the boundary of $\Theta_1$. First, note that, for any
$\theta \in \Theta_1$, the gradient of the log empirical likelihood is
given by
$$\nabla \log L(\theta)  =  -n\sum_{i=1}^n \hat \omega_i(\theta)    \hat{\lambda}(\theta)^{\text{\tiny T}}  \nabla g(x_i,\theta).$$
where $\hat{\lambda}(\theta)$ is the estimated Lagrange multiplier
satisfying the equation:

$$\begin{equation}
\label{eq:lagmult}
\sum_{i=1}^n \frac{g(x_i,\theta)}{\left\{1+ \hat\lambda(\theta)^{\text{\tiny T}} g(x_i,\theta) \right\}}=0.
\end{equation}   (\#eq:lagmult)$$

Note that, the gradient depends on the value of the Lagrange multiplier
but not on the value of its gradient.

Now, Under assumption A3, it follows that the gradient of the log
empirical likelihood diverges on the set of all boundary points
$\partial\Theta_1^{(q-1)}$. More specifically one can show:

1.  As $\theta^{(k)}\rightarrow \theta^{(0)}$,
    $\parallel\hat \lambda(\theta^{(k)})\parallel\to\infty$.

2.  If $\theta^{(0)}\in \partial\Theta_1^{(q-1)}$, under as
    $\theta^{(k)}\rightarrow \theta^{(0)}$,
    ${\parallel \nabla \log L(\theta^{(k)}) \parallel}\to \infty$.

Therefore, it follows that at every boundary point $\theta^{(0)}$ of
$\Theta_1$ such that $0$ belongs to one of the $(q-1)$-dimensional faces
of $\mathcal{C}(x,\theta^{(0)})$, at least one component of the
estimated Lagrange multiplier and the gradient of the log empirical
likelihood diverges to positive or negative infinity. The gradient of
the negative log empirical likelihood represents the direction of the
steepest increase of the negative log empirical likelihood. Since the
value of the log empirical likelihood should typically be highest around
the center of the support $\Theta_1$, the gradient near the boundary of
$\Theta_1$ should point towards its center. This property can be
exploited in forcing candidates of $\theta$ generated by HMC proposals
to bounce back towards the interior of $\Theta_1$ from its boundaries
and in consequence reducing the chance of them getting out of the
support.

### Hamiltonian Monte Carlo Sampling for Bayesian Empirical Likelihood {#sec:hmc}

Hamiltonian Monte Carlo algorithm is a Metropolis algorithm where the
successive steps are proposed by using Hamiltonian dynamics. One can
visualise these dynamics as a cube sliding without friction under
gravity in a bowl with a smooth surface. The total energy of the cube is
the sum of the potential energy $U(\theta)$, defined by its position
$\theta$ (in this case its height) and kinetic energy $K(p)$, which is
determined by its momentum $p$. The total energy of the cube will be
conserved and it will continue to slide up and down on the smooth
surface of the bowl forever. The potential and the kinetic energy would,
however, vary with the position of the cube.

In order to use the Hamiltonian dynamics to sample from the posterior
$\Pi\left(\theta\mid x\right)$ we set our potential and kinetic energy
as follows:
$$U(\theta)=-\log\Pi(\theta|x)\quad\text{and}\quad K(p)=\frac{1}{2}p^TM^{-1}p.$$
Here, the momentum vector $p=\left(p_1,p_2,\ldots,p_d\right)$ is a
totally artificial construct usually generated from a $N(0, M)$
distribution. Most often the covariance matrix $M$ is chosen to be a
diagonal matrix with diagonal $(m_1,m_2,\ldots,m_d)$, in which case each
$m_i$ is interpreted as the mass of the $i$th parameter. The Hamiltonian
of the system is the total energy
$$\begin{equation}
\label{hamiltonian dynamics}
\mathcal{H}(\theta,p)=U(\theta)+K(p).
\end{equation}   (\#eq:hamiltonian-dynamics)$$

In Hamiltonian mechanics, the variation in the position $\theta$ and
momentum $p$ with time $t$ is determined by the partial derivatives of
$\mathcal{H}$ with $p$ and $\theta$ respectively. In particular, the
motion is governed by the pair of so-called Hamiltonian equations:
$$\begin{eqnarray}
\frac{d\theta}{dt}&=&\frac{\partial \mathcal{H}}{\partial p}=M^{-1}p, \label{PDE1}\\
\frac{dp}{dt}&=&-\frac{\partial\mathcal{ H}}{\partial \theta}=-\frac{\partial U(\theta)}{\partial \theta}.\label{PDE2}
\end{eqnarray}   (\#eq:PDE1)$$
It is easy to show that (Neal 2011) Hamiltonian dynamics is reversible,
invariant, and volume preserving, which makes it suitable for MCMC
sampling schemes.

In HMC we propose successive states by solving the Hamiltonian equations
\@ref(eq:PDE1) and [\[PDE2\]](#PDE2){reference-type="eqref"
reference="PDE2"}. Unfortunately, they cannot be solved analytically
(except of course for a few simple cases), and they must be approximated
numerically at discrete time points. There are several ways to
numerically approximate these two equations in the literature
(Leimkuhler and Reich 2004). For the purpose of MCMC sampling, we need a
method that is reversible and volume-preserving.

Leapfrog integration (Birdsall and Langdon 2004) is one such method to
numerically integrate the pair of Hamiltonian equations. In this method,
a step-size $\epsilon$ for the time variable $t$ is first chosen. Given
the value of $\theta$ and $p$ at the current time point $t$ (denoted
here by $\theta(t)$ and $p(t)$ respectively), the leapfrog updates the
position and the momentum at time $t+\epsilon$ as follows
$$\begin{eqnarray}
p\left(t+\frac{\epsilon}{2}\right)&=&p(t)-\frac{\epsilon}{2}\frac{\partial U(\theta(t))}{\partial\theta},\label{leapfrog1}\\
\theta(t+\epsilon)&=&\theta(t)+\epsilon M^{-1}p\left(t+\frac{\epsilon}{2}\right),\label{leapfrog2}\\
p(t+\epsilon)&=&p\left(t+\frac{\epsilon}{2}\right)-\frac{\epsilon}{2}\frac{\partial U(\theta(t+\epsilon))}{\partial\theta}.\label{leapfrog3}
\end{eqnarray}   (\#eq:leapfrog1)$$

Theoretically, due to its symmetry, the leapfrog integration satisfies
the reversibility and preserves the volume. However, because of the
numerical inaccuracies, the volume is not preserved. This is similar to
the Langevin-Hastings algorithm (Besag 2004), which is a special case of
HMC. Fortunately, the lack of invariance in volume is easily corrected.
The accept-reject step in the MCMC procedure ensures that the chain
converges to the correct posterior.

At the beginning of each iteration of the HMC algorithm, the momentum
vector $p$ is randomly sampled from the $N(0,M)$ distribution. Starting
with the current state $(\theta,p)$, the leapfrog integrator described
above is used to simulate Hamiltonian dynamics for $T$ steps with a step
size of $\epsilon$. At the end of this $T$-step trajectory, the momentum
$p$ is negated so that the Metropolis proposal is symmetric. At the end
of this T-step iteration, the proposed state $(\theta^*,p^*)$ is
accepted with probability
$$\min\{1,\exp(-\mathcal{H}(\theta^*,p^*)+\mathcal{H}(\theta,p))\}.$$

The gradient of the log-posterior used in the leapfrog is a sum of the
gradient of the log empirical likelihood and the gradient of the log
prior. The prior is user-specified and it is hypothetically possible
that even though at least one component of the gradient of the log
empirical likelihood diverges at the boundary $\partial\Theta_1$, the
log prior gradient may behave in a way so that the effect is nullified
and the log posterior gradient remains finite over the closure of
$\Theta_1$. We make the following assumption on the prior mainly to
avoid this possibility (see Chaudhuri et al. (2017) for more details).

- Consider a sequence $\{\theta^{(k)} \}$, $k=1, 2,\ldots$, of points in
  $\Theta_1$ such that $\theta^{(k)}$ converges to a boundary point
  $\theta^{(0)}$ of $\Theta_1$. Assume that $\theta^{(0)}$ lies within
  $\Theta$ and $L(\theta^{(k)})$ strictly decreases to
  $L(\theta^{(0)})$, Then, for some constant $b(n, \theta^{(0)}) > -1$,
  we have
  $$\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:liminf2}
   \liminf_{k\to\infty}   \frac{ \log\pi(\theta^{(k-1)})  -  \log\pi(\theta^{(k)}) }{ \log L(\theta^{(k-1)} ) - \log L(\theta^{(k)} ) } \ge b(n, \theta^{(0)}).
  \end{equation}   (\#eq:liminf2)$$

The assumption implies that near the boundary of the support, the main
contribution in the gradient of the log-posterior with respect to any
parameter appearing in the argument of the estimating equations comes
from the corresponding gradient of the log empirical likelihood. This is
in most cases expected, especially if the sample size is large. For a
large sample size, the log-likelihood should be the dominant term in the
log-posterior. We are just assuming here that the gradients behave the
same way. It would also ensure that at the boundary, the gradient of the
log-likelihood and the log-posterior do not cancel each other, which is
crucial for the proposed Hamiltonian Monte Carlo to work.

Under these assumptions, Chaudhuri et al. (2017) show that the gradient
of the log-posterior diverges along almost every sequence as the
parameter values approach the boundary $\partial \Theta_1$ from the
interior of the support. More specifically, they prove that:

$$\begin{equation}
\label{eq:postdiv}
\Bigl\| \nabla \log \pi(\theta^{(k)} \mid x) \Bigr\| \rightarrow \infty, \hspace{.1in} \mbox{ as } \hspace{.1in} k \rightarrow \infty.
\end{equation}   (\#eq:postdiv)$$

Since the $q-1$ dimensional faces of $\mathcal{C}(x,\theta^{(0)})$ have
larger volume than its faces with lower dimension (see Figure
[1](#fig:scheme){reference-type="ref" reference="fig:scheme"}), a random
sequence of points from the interior to the boundary would converge to a
point on $\partial \Theta_1^{(q-1)}$ with probability $1$. Thus under
our assumptions, the gradient of the log-posterior would diverge to
infinity for these sequences with a high probability. The lower
dimensional faces of the convex hull (a polytope) are an intersection of
$q-1$ dimensional faces. Although, it is not clear if the norm of the
gradient of the posterior will diverge on those faces. It is conjectured
that this would happen. However, even if the conjecture is not true,
from the setup, it is clear that the sampler would rarely move to the
region where the origin belongs to the lower dimensional faces of the
convex hull.

As has been pointed out above, the gradient vector would always point
towards the mode of the posterior. From our results, since the gradient
is large near the support boundary, whenever the HMC sampler approaches
the boundary due to the high value of the gradient it would reflect
towards the interior of the support and not get out of it. The leapfrog
parameters can be controlled to increase efficiency of sampling.

## Package description {#sec:package}

The main function of the package is `ELHMC`. It draws samples from an
empirical likelihood Bayesian posterior of the parameter of interest
using Hamiltonian Monte Carlo once the estimating equations involving
the parameters, the prior distribution of the parameters, the gradients
of the estimating equations, and the log priors are specified. Some
other parameters which control the HMC process can also be specified.

Suppose that the data set consists of observations
$x = \left( x_1, ..., x_n \right)$ where each $x_i$ is a vector of
length $p$ and follows a probability distribution $F$ of family
$\mathcal{F}_{\theta}$. Here
$\theta = \left(\theta_1,...,\theta_d\right)$ is the $d-$dimensional
parameter of interest associated with $F$. Suppose there exist smooth
functions
$g\left(\theta, x_i\right) = \left(g_1\left(\theta, x_i\right)\right.$,
$\ldots$, $\left. g_q\left(\theta, x_i\right)\right)^T$ which satisfy
$E_F\left[g\left(\theta,x_i\right)\right] = 0$. As we have explained
above, `ELHMC` is used to draw samples of $\theta$ from its posterior
defined by an empirical likelihood.

  : (#tab:T1) Arguments for function
:::

Table [1](#tab:T1){reference-type="ref" reference="arguments"} enlists
the full list of arguments for . Arguments and define the problem. They
are the data set $x$ and the collection of smooth functions in $g$. The
user-specified starting point for $\theta$ is given in , whereas is the
number of samples of $\theta$ to be drawn. The gradient matrix of $g$
with respect to the parameter $\theta$ (i.e. $\nabla_{\theta}g$) has to
be specified in . At the moment the function does not compute the
gradient numerically by itself. The prior represents the joint density
functions of $\theta_1,..,\theta_q$, which for the purpose of this
description we denote by $\pi$. The gradient of the log prior function
is specified in . The function returns a vector containing the values of
$\frac{\partial}{\partial \theta_1}\pi\left(\theta\right),..,\frac{\partial}{\partial\theta_d}\pi\left(\theta\right)$.
Finally, the arguments , , and are hyper-parameters which control the
Hamiltonian Monte Carlo algorithm.

The arguments , , and can be used to tune the HMC samplers. They can be
used for printing and plotting the sampled values at specified intervals
while the code is running. The argument allows the user to only plot the
variables whose convergence needs to be checked.

Given the data and a value of $\theta$, computes the optimal weights
using the function from library (Zhou 2014). The provides
$\hat{\lambda}\left(\theta^{(k)}\right)$ from which the gradient of the
log-empirical likelihood can be computed.

If $\theta\not\in\Theta_1$, i.e. problem \@ref(eq:eqn5) is not feasible,
then converges to weights all close to zero which do not sum to one.
Furthermore, the norm of $\hat{\lambda}\left(\theta^{(k)}\right)$ will
be large. In such cases, the empirical likelihood will be zero. This
means that, whenever the optimal weights are computed, we need to check
if they sum to one (within numerical errors) or not.

The function returns a list. If argument is set to , the list contains
samples of the parameters of interest $\theta$, the Monte Carlo
acceptance rate as listed in table [2](#tab:T2){reference-type="ref"

## Examples {#sec:examples}

In this section, we present two examples of usage of the package. Both
examples in some sense supplement the conditions considered by Chaudhuri
et al. (2017). In each case, it is seen that the function can sample
from the resulting empirical likelihood-based posterior quite
efficiently.

### Sample the mean of a simple data set

In the first example, suppose the data set consists of eight data points
$v = \left(v_1,...,v_8\right)$:

``` r
R> v <- rbind(c(1, 1), c(1, 0), c(1, -1), c(0, -1),
+            c(-1, -1), c(-1, 0), c(-1, 1), c(0, 1))
R> print(v)
     [,1] [,2]
[1,]    1    1
[2,]    1    0
[3,]    1   -1
[4,]    0   -1
[5,]   -1   -1
[6,]   -1    0
[7,]   -1    1
[8,]    0    1
```

The parameters of interest are the mean
$\theta = \left(\theta_1, \theta_2\right)$. Since
$E\left[\theta - v_i\right] = 0$, the smooth function is
$g = \theta - v_i$ with
$\nabla_\theta g = \left(\left(1, 0\right), \left(0, 1\right)\right)$:

``` r
Function: fun
R> g <- function(params, x) {
+   params - x
+ }

Function: dfun
R> dlg <- function(params, x) {
+   rbind(c(1, 0), c(0, 1))
+ }
```

Functions and are supplied to arguments and in . These two functions
must have as the first argument and as the second. represents a sample
of $\theta$ whereas represents a data point $v_i$ or a row in the matrix
. should return a vector and a matrix whose $\left(i, j\right)$ entry is
$\partial g_i/\partial\theta_j$.

We assume that both $\theta_1$ and $\theta_2$ have independent standard
normal distributions as priors. Next, we define the functions that
calculate the prior densities and gradients of log prior densities as
and in the following ways:

``` r
Function: prior
R> pr <- function(x) {
+   -.5*(x[1]^2+x[2]^2)-log(2*pi)
+ }
Function: dprior
R> dpr <- function(x) {
+   -x
+ }
```

Functions and are assigned to and in . and must take in only one
argument and return a vector of the same length as $\theta$.

We can now use to draw samples of $\theta$. Let us draw 1000 samples,
with starting point $\left(0.9, 0.95\right)$ using 12 leapfrog steps
with step size 0.06 for both $\theta_1$ and $\theta_2$ for each
Hamiltonian Monte Carlo update:

``` r
R> library(elhmc)
R> set.seed(476)
R> thetas <- ELHMC(initial = c(0.9, 0.95), data = v, fun = g, dfun = dlg,
+                 prior = pr, dprior = dpr, n.samples = 1000,
+                 lf.steps = 12, epsilon = 0.06, detailed = TRUE)
```

We extract and visualise the distribution of the samples using a boxplot
(Figure [\[theta\]](#theta){reference-type="ref" reference="theta"}):

``` r
R> boxplot(thetas$samples, names = c(expression(theta[1]), expression(theta[2])))
```

Since we set , we have data on the trajectory of $\theta$ as well as
momentum $p$. They are stored in element of and can be accessed by
`thetas$trajectory`. `thetas$trajectory` is a list with two elements
named and denoting trajectories for $\theta$ and momentum $p$. and are
both lists with elements , \..., . Each of these elements is a matrix
containing trajectories of $\theta$ () and $p$ () at each Hamiltonian
Monte Carlo update.

We illustrate by extracting the trajectories of $\theta$ at the first
update and plotting them (Figure
[2](#trajectoryeg1){reference-type="ref" reference="trajectoryeg1"}):

``` r
R> q <- thetas$trajectory$trajectory.q[[1]]
R> plot(q, xlab = expression(theta[1]), ylab = expression(theta[2]),
+      xlim = c(-1, 1), ylim = c(-1, 1), cex = 1, pch = 16)
R> points(v[,1],v[,2],type="p",cex=1.5,pch=16)
R> abline(h=-1); abline(h=1); abline(v=-1); abline(v=1)
R> arrows(q[-nrow(q), 1], q[-nrow(q), 2], q[-1, 1], q[-1, 2],
+        length = 0.1, lwd = 1.5)
```

The specialty in this example is in the choice of the data points in
$v$. Chaudhuri et al. (2017) show that the chain will reflect if the
one-dimensional boundaries of the convex hull (in this case the unit
square) have two observations, which happens with probability one for
continuous distributions. In this example, however, there is more than
one point in two one-dimensional boundaries. However, we can see that
the HMC method works very well here.

### Logistic regression with an additional constraint {#ex:2}

In this example, we consider a constrained logistic regression of one
binary variable on another, where the expectation of the response is
known. The frequentist estimation problem using empirical likelihood was
considered by Chaudhuri et al. (2008). It has been shown that empirical
likelihood-based formulation has a major applicational advantage over
the fully parametric formulation. Below we consider a Bayesian extension
of the proposed empirical likelihood-based formulation and use to sample
from the resulting posterior.

The data set $v$ consists of $n$ observations of two variables and two
columns $X$ and $Y$. In the ith row $y_i$ represents the indicator of
whether a woman gave birth between time $t - 1$ and $t$ while $x_i$ is
the indicator of whether she had at least one child at time $t - 1$. The
data can be found in Table
[\[tab:bhps\]](#tab:bhps){reference-type="ref" reference="tab:bhps"}
above. In addition, it was known that the prevalent general fertility
rate in the population was $0.06179$. [^4]

We are interested in fitting a logistic regression model to the data
with $X$ as the independent variable and $Y$ as the dependent variable.
However, we also would like to constrain the sample general fertility
rate to its value in the population. The logistic regression model takes
the form of:

$$P \left(Y = 1 | X = x\right) = \frac{\exp\left(\beta_0 + \beta_1 x\right)}{1 + \exp\left(\beta_0 + \beta_1 x\right)}.$$

From the model, using conditions similar to zero-mean residual and
exogeneity, it is clear that:

$$\begin{equation*}
E\left[y_i - \frac{\exp\left(\beta_0 + \beta_1 x_i\right)}{1 + \exp\left(\beta_0 + \beta_1 x_i\right)}\right] = 0,\quad
E\left[x_i\left\{y_i - \frac{\exp\left(\beta_0 + \beta_1 x_i\right)}{1 + \exp\left(\beta_0 + \beta_1 x_i\right)}\right\}\right] = 0.
\end{equation*}$$

Furthermore from the definition of general fertility rate, we get:

$$E\left[y_i - 0.06179\right] = 0.$$

Following Chaudhuri et al. (2008), we define the estimating equations
$g$ as follows:

$$g \left(\beta, v_i\right) = \begin{bmatrix}
y_i - \frac{\exp\left(\beta_0 + \beta_1 x_i\right)}{1 + \exp\left(\beta_0 + \beta_1 x_i\right)} \\
x_i\left[y_i - \frac{\exp\left(\beta_0 + \beta_1 x_i\right)}{1 + \exp\left(\beta_0 + \beta_1 x_i\right)}\right] \\
y_i - 0.06179 \\
\end{bmatrix}$$

The gradient of $g$ with respect to $\beta$ is given by:

$$\nabla_{\beta}g = \begin{bmatrix}
\frac{-\exp\left(\beta_0 + \beta_1 x_i\right)}{\left(\exp\left(\beta_0 + \beta_1 x_i\right) + 1\right)^2} & \frac{-\exp\left(\beta_0 + \beta_1 x_i\right) x_i}{\left(\exp\left(\beta_0 + \beta_1 x_i\right) + 1\right)^2} \\
\frac{-\exp\left(\beta_0 + \beta_1 x_i\right) x_i}{\left(\exp\left(\beta_0 + \beta_1 x_i\right) + 1\right)^2} & \frac{-\exp\left(\beta_0 + \beta_1 x_i\right) x_i^2}{\left(\exp\left(\beta_0 + \beta_1 x_i\right) + 1\right)^2} \\
0 & 0 \\
\end{bmatrix}$$

In R, we create functions and to represent $g$ and $\nabla_{\beta}g$:

``` r

We choose independent $N\left(0, 100\right)$ priors for both $\beta_0$
and $\beta_1$:

``` r
Function: prior
R> pr <- function(x) {
+    - 0.5*t(x)%*%x/10^4 - log(2*pi*10^4)
+ },
Function: dprior
R> dpr <- function(x) {
+   -x * 10 ^ (-4)
+ },
```

where is the prior and is the gradient of the log prior for $\beta$.

Our goal is to use to draw samples of
$\beta = \left( \beta_0, \beta_1 \right)$ from their resulting posterior
based on empirical likelihood.

We start our sampling from $(-3.2,0.55)$ and use two stages of sampling.
In the first stage, $50$ points are sampled with $\epsilon=0.001$,
$T=15$, and the momentum generated from a $N(0,0.02\cdot I_2)$
distribution. The acceptance rate at this stage is very high, but it is
designed to find a good starting point for the second stage, where the
acceptance rate can be easily controlled.

``` r
R> bstart.init=c(-3.2,.55)
R> betas.init <- ELHMC(initial = bstart.init, data = data, FUN = g, DFUN = dg,
+               n.samples = 50, prior = pr, dprior = dpr, epsilon = 0.001,
+               lf.steps = 15, detailed = T, p.variance = 0.2)
```

</figure>

In this second stage, we draw 500 samples of $\beta$ with starting
values as the last value from the first stage. The number of leapfrog
steps per Monte Carlo update is set to 30, with a step size of 0.004 for
both $\beta_0$ and $\beta_1$. We use
$N \left(0, 0.02\textbf(I_2)\right)$ as prior for the momentum.

``` r
R> bstart=betas.init$samples[50,]
R> betas <- ELHMC(initial = bstart, data = data, fun = g, dfun = dg,
+                n.samples = 500, prior = pr, dprior = dpr, epsilon = 0.004,
+                lf.steps = 30, detailed = FALSE, p.variance = 0.2,print.interval=10,
+		 plot.interval=1,which.plot=c(1))
```

Based on our output, we can make inferences about $\beta$. As an
example, the autocorrelation plots and the density plot of the last
$1000$ samples of $\beta$ are shown in Figure
[3](#fig:density){reference-type="ref" reference="fig:density"}.

``` r
R> library(MASS)
R> beta.density <- kde2d(betas$sample[, 1], betas$samples[, 2])
R> persp(beta.density, phi = 50, theta = 20,
+       xlab = 'Intercept', ylab = '', zlab = 'Density',
+       ticktype = 'detailed', cex.axis = 0.35, cex.lab = 0.35, d = 0.7)
R> acf(betas$sample[round(n.samp/2):n.samp, 1],
+       main=expression(paste("Series ",beta[0])))
R> acf(betas$sample[round(n.samp/2):n.samp, 2],
+       main=expression(paste("Series ",beta[1])))
```

It is well known (Chaudhuri et al. 2008) that the constrained estimates
of $\beta_0$ and $\beta_1$ have very low standard error. The acceptance
rate is close to $78\%$. It is evident that our software can sample from
such a narrow ridge with ease. Furthermore, the autocorrelation of the
samples seems to decrease very quickly with the lag, which would not be
the case for most other MCMC procedures.
