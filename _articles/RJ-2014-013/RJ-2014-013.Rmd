title: The gridSVG Package
abstract: The gridSVG package can be used to generate a grid-based R plot in an SVG
  format, with the ability to add special effects to the plot. The special effects
  include animation, interactivity, and advanced graphical features, such as masks
  and filters. This article provides a basic introduction to important functions in
  the gridSVG package and discusses the advantages and disadvantages of gridSVG compared
  to similar R packages.
