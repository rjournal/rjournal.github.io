title: New Numerical Algorithm for Multivariate Normal Probabilities in Package mvtnorm
abstract: '? proposed a numerical algorithm for evaluating multivariate normal probabilities.
  Starting with version 0.9-0 of the mvtnorm package (??), this algorithm is available
  to the R community. We give a brief introduction to Miwa’s procedure and compare
  it to a quasi-randomized Monte-Carlo procedure proposed by ?, which has been available
  through mvtnorm for some years now, both with respect to computing time and accuracy.'
