title: 'ordinalClust: An R Package to Analyze Ordinal Data'
abstract: ' Ordinal data are used in many domains, especially when measurements are
  collected from people through observations, tests, or questionnaires. [ordinalClust](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=ordinalClust)
  is an innovative R package dedicated to ordinal data that provides tools for modeling,
  clustering, co-clustering and classifying such data. Ordinal data are modeled using
  the BOS distribution, which is a model with two meaningful parameters referred to
  as \"position\" and \"precision\". The former indicates the mode of the distribution
  and the latter describes how scattered the data are around the mode: the user is
  able to easily interpret the distribution of their data when given these two parameters.
  The package is based on the co-clustering framework (when rows and columns are simultaneously
  clustered). The co-clustering approach uses the Latent Block Model (LBM) and the
  SEM-Gibbs algorithm for parameter inference. On the other hand, the clustering and
  the classification methods follow on from simplified versions of the SEM-Gibbs algorithm.
  For the classification process, two approaches are proposed. In the first one, the
  BOS parameters are estimated from the training dataset in the conventional way.
  In the second approach, parsimony is introduced by estimating the parameters and
  column-clusters from the training dataset. We empirically show that this approach
  can yield better results. For the clustering and co-clustering processes, the ICL-BIC
  criterion is used for model selection purposes. An overview of these methods is
  given, and the way to use them with the ordinalClust package is described using
  real datasets. The latest stable package version is available on the Comprehensive
  R Archive Network (CRAN). '
