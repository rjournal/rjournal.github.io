# Introduction {#sec:intro}

Clustering plays a key role in various areas including data mining,
character recognition, information retrieval, machine learning applied
in diverse fields such as marketing, medicine, engineering, computer
science, etc. A clustering algorithm forms groups of similar items in a
data set which is a crucial step in analysing complex data. Clustering
can be formulated as an optimisation problem assigning items to clusters
while minimising the distances among the cluster members. The normally
used clustering algorithms do usually not find the optimal solution
because the clustering problem is NP-complete in the general case. This
paper introduces a package implementing an optimisation method for
clustering in a special case when a sequential constraint should be met,
i.e., when the items to be clustered are sorted and only subsequent
items may form a cluster. This constraint is common when clustering data
streams, e.g., audio and video streams, trajectories, motion tracks,
click-streams etc. The good news is that the exact optimum can be found
in polynomial time in this case.

The algorithm recommended for clustering sequential data is based on the
dynamic programing approach developed by @Wang2011. They gave a
polynomial-time algorithm for one-dimensional clustering, i.e., when the
items can be characterised by only one scalar number. Similarly to the
heuristic $k$-means algorithm, it divides data into $k$ groups and it
minimises the within-cluster sum of squared distances (WCSS or
$\mathit{withinss}$ for short). The algorithm guarantees a solution
minimising the optimisation goal. The source code of the algorithm is
available in the R package
[*Ckmeans.1d.dp*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=Ckmeans.1d.dp)
[@R]. The generalisation of the algorithm to the multiple dimensional
space has been open so far. We extended the dynamic programming approach
from one-dimensional clustering to multidimensional clustering with
sequential constraint (i.e., only subsequent elements of the input may
form a cluster). The method finds the exact optimum in this case as
well. We implemented the algorithm in the R package
[*clustering.sc.dp*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=clustering.sc.dp)
[@R_sc].

Although the original algorithm has been developed to find the optimal
solution with exactly $k$ clusters it can determine the optimal value
for all numbers of clusters less than or equal to $k$ in a single run.
For this reason, we implemented two variants of the algorithm. The first
one finds the optimal solution for a specific $k$ which can be used if
the number of clusters is known in advance. The second variant returns
the vector containing the minimal $\mathit{withinss}$ for all cluster
numbers less than or equal to $k$. This extension of the algorithm is
useful if the number of clusters is not known in advance which is a
common case.

The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: In the next
section, a brief overview of the related work is presented. Then the
optimization problem is formally described and the developed
optimization algorithm is introduced in detail. Some evaluation results
are also presented and the usage of the implemented package is
introduced. A brief summary concludes the paper.

# Related work {#sec:related_work}

Several clustering models and a broad variety of clustering methods are
available in the literature [@Jain2010; @Tan2006]. Minimising
$\mathit{withinss}$ is a common optimisation goal used, e.g., in the
popular $k$-means method [@Lloyd1982] to find a solution for a specific
number of clusters and in the Ward's method [@WardJ1963] belonging to
the hierarchical clustering methods. The problem is NP-complete
[@Aloise2009; @Dasgupta2009; @Mahajan2009]. The general clustering
methods cannot be directly applied to our problem because the produced
solution usually violates the sequential constraint.

As mentioned, one-dimensional clustering can be solved in polynomial
time [@Wang2011]. The problem represents a special kind of clustering
with sequential constraint because a necessary condition for the
optimality in one dimension is that only subsequent items may form a
cluster if the items are considered in their scalar order. The package
presented in this paper generalised the one-dimensional clustering
method to the multidimensional case. The dynamic programming method used
for optimal clustering in one dimension is essentially the same as the
one first applied by @Bellman1961 for linear curve approximation. For
this reason, our package can be also considered as an implementation of
the optimal dynamic programming clustering method proposed by Bellman.

Several papers (e.g., @Himberg2001, @Terzi2006, @Tierney2014) are
dealing with clustering with sequential constraints because processing
data sequences has a broad application area. @Leiva2013 gave a
clustering algorithm called Warped $k$-means for minimising
$\mathit{withinss}$ while considering the sequential constraint. The
algorithm tries to reach the optimum by moving items between subsequent
clusters. It does not guarantee optimality. Their paper provides a good
overview as well on the taxonomy of the problem.

# The problem specification {#sec:problem}

Clustering methods divide a dataset $X = \left\{\overline
  x_1,\overline x_2, \ldots,\overline x_n\right\}$ of $d$-dimensional
vectors into a set $\Pi = \left\{C_1, C_2,\ldots, C_k\right\}$ of
disjoint clusters where $n$ and $k$ denote the number of items to be
clustered and the number of clusters, respectively. Throughout the
paper, vectors are distinguished from scalars by a bar over their
symbol. In case of clustering with sequential constraint, the items are
sorted and the clusters are formed only by subsequent items: $C_j
= \left\{\overline x_{b_j}, \overline x_{b_j+1},\ldots,\overline
  x_{b_j+n_j-1}\right\}$ where $b_j$ and $n_j$ denote the first item and
the number of items in cluster $C_j$, respectively. The optimisation
goal is to minimise the within-cluster sum of squared distances
($\mathit{withinss}$) also called sum of squared error (SSE), sum of
quadratic errors (SQE) or distortion which is a common measurement of
quality in clustering. It is formally defined as follows:

$$\begin{equation} \label{eq:wcss} \mathit{withinss} = \sum_{j=1}^k \sum_{\overline x_i\in C_j}\left\|\overline x_i-\overline \mu_j\right\|^2,  
\end{equation}   (\#eq:eqwcss) $$

where $\left\|\overline x \right\|$ denotes the Euclidean norm of vector
$\overline x$ and $\overline \mu_j$ is the cluster mean:

$$\overline \mu_j = \frac{1}{n_j} \sum_{\overline x_i\in C_j}\overline x_i.$$

Now, we can formulate our problem as follows:

Input:

Items to be clustered:
$X = \left\{\overline x_1, \overline x_2, \ldots,\overline x_n\right\}$,

Number of clusters: $k$.

Output:

Optimal clustering: $\Pi = \left\{C_1, C_2,\ldots, C_k\right\}$.

Minimise

within-cluster sum of squared distances ($\mathit{withinss}$):
Eq.Â \@ref(eq:eqwcss).

Subject to

sequential constraint:
$$\left(\overline x_{i_1}\in C_j\right) \land \left(\overline x_{i_2}\in C_j\right) \land \left(i_1\le i_3\le i_2\right) \Rightarrow \left(\overline x_{i_3}\in C_j\right).$$

general clustering conditions:

each item is clustered:

$$\forall \overline x_i \exists C_j: \overline x_i\in C_j.$$

one cluster is assigned to each item

$$\left(\overline x_i\in C_{j_1}\right) \land \left(\overline x_i\in C_{j_2}\right)\Rightarrow \left(j_1 = j_2\right).$$

# The dynamic programming algorithm {#sec:algorithm}

The recursive formula used in the dynamic programming formulation is
based on the fact, that if clustering for the first $i$ items in $m$
clusters is optimal then after dropping the last cluster the resulting
clustering is optimal with $m-1$ clusters for the remaining items. Let
$D[i,m]$ denote the value of the minimal within-cluster sum of squared
distances ($\mathit{withinss}$) of the clustering for the first $i$
items by using $m$ clusters. If $j$ denotes the first item of the $m$th
cluster then the optimality of $D[i,m]$ implies the optimality of
$D[j-1,m-1]$ as well. $D[n,k]$ gives the minimal $\mathit{withinss}$ for
clustering all items in $k$ clusters where $n$ denotes the total number
of items.

The recursive formula applied in the dynamic programming approach is
defined as follows [@Wang2011]:

$$D[i,m]=\min_{m\le j\le i} \left\{D[j-1,m-1]+d\left(\overline x_j,\ldots,\overline x_i\right)\right\}, 1\le i\le n, 1\le m\le k$$

where $d\left(\overline x_j,\ldots\overline x_i\right)$ is the sum of
squared Euclidean distances from $\overline x_j,\ldots\overline x_i$ to
their mean.

The optimal solution can be determined by dynamic programming in two
steps. First, the recursive formula is used to find the minimal
$\mathit{withinss}$. Then backtracking finds the optimal clustering.

$B[i,m]$ stores the index of the first item $b_m$ of the last cluster in
the partial solution belonging to $D[i,m]$ which is used for
backtracking the optimal solution after determining the minimal
$\mathit{withinss}$. We apply the dynamic programming method to solve
optimal clustering for a range of cluster numbers and $k$ denotes the
maximum number of clusters in our algorithm ($1\le k \le n$). The steps
of calculating $D[i,m]$ can be implemented as follows:

``` r
  for i := 0 to n
    D[i, 0] := 0	// initialisations
  for i := 1 to n
    for m := 1 to min(i, k)
      D[i, m] := MAX_DOUBLE;
      for j := i downto m	// calculating the recursive formula
        if D[i, m] > D[j - 1, m - 1] + d(xj, ..., xi)
          D[i, m] := D[j - 1, m - 1] + d(xj, ..., xi)
          B[i, m] := j 
  Return D[n, m] for m = 1, ..., k	 
```

$D[n, m], m = 1,\ldots,k$ gives the minimal distances for different
number of clusters. If the number of clusters is known in advance, it is
enough to return $D[n,k]$. Otherwise, $D[n, m]$ for all $m\le k$ can be
returned for further processing by the user in order to select the
proper number of clusters.

The algorithm finds the exact optimum in polynomial time. It runs
$O\left(n^2k\right)$ iterations in which $D[i, m]$ is checked and, if
necessary, updated. Each iteration can be performed in time proportional
to the dimensions of the vectors ($O\left(d\right)$) independently from
the number of items and clusters if
$d\left(\overline x_j, \ldots,\overline x_i\right)$ is computed
progressively based on $d\left(\overline x_{j+1}, \ldots,\overline
  x_i\right)$ and the average of the items. This can be done similarly
to the one-dimensional case in the following way. Let $\overline
\mu_{j,i}$ denote the mean of the items with index between $j$ and $i$.
If $j = i$ $d\left(\overline x_j, \ldots,\overline x_i\right) =
0, \overline \mu_{j,i} = \overline x_i$. For index $j$ from $i-1$ down
to $m$, the algorithm iteratively computes
$$\begin{aligned}
  d\left(\overline x_j, \ldots,\overline x_i\right) &= d\left(\overline x_{j+1}, \ldots,\overline x_i\right)+\frac{ i-j}{ i-j+1}\left(\overline x_j-\overline \mu_{j,i-1}\right)^2\\
\overline \mu_{j,i} &= \frac{\overline x_j +\left(i-j\right)\overline \mu_{j+1,i}}{ i-j+1}
\end{aligned}$$
Using the above iterative computation, the overall running time is
quadratic in the number of items and linear in the number of clusters
and the dimensions of the vectors: $O\left(n^2kd\right)$.

The optimal solution with cluster number $m$ can be backtracked by the
help of $B[i,m]$ [@Wang2011]:

$$B[i,m] =  \mathrm{argmin}_{m\le j\le i}\left\{D[j-1,m-1]+ d\left(\overline x_j,\ldots, \overline x_i \right)\right\}, 1\le i\le n, 1\le m\le k$$

$B[n,m]$ is equal to the first item of the last cluster in clustering
with $m$ clusters. The last cluster contains items
$\overline x_{B[n,m]},\ldots,\overline x_n$. The further clusters can be
determined by using backtracking as follows: if $j$ is the first item of
the $l$th cluster then the preceding cluster is formed by the items
$\overline x_{B[j,l-1]},\ldots,\overline x_{j-1}$. The steps of
backtracking to the find optimal clustering using $m$ number of clusters
are as follows:

``` r
  the mth cluster is B[n, m], ..., n
  j := B[n, m]
  for l := m to 2
    the (l - 1)th cluster is B[j, l - 1], ..., j - 1
    j = B[j, l - 1]
```

Backtracking can be performed in linear time in the number of the
clusters ($O\left(k\right)$).

We would like to mention how to combine the dynamic programming method
with methods finding the proper number of clusters. The cluster numbers
are typically determined by using a measure of validity (e.g.,
$\mathit{withinss}$) indicating the goodness of clustering. The "best"
$k$ is chosen based on the analysis of the values of the measure for
each $k$ within the range of the possible number of clusters. A huge
variety of methods are available in the literature to determine the
cluster numbers [@Milligan1985; @Dimitriadou2002]. Typically, they are
applied on the output generated by hierarchical clustering methods.
Although our dynamic programming approach does not belong to the
hierarchical clustering similar methods can be used on the result of our
algorithm for finding the proper number of clusters.

Backtracking can be performed only once if the number of clusters is
known in advance or it can be selected by analysing $\mathit{withinss}$
contained in the last column of matrix $D$. Otherwise, backtracking
should be executed for each possible cluster numbers for further
analysis. The method can efficiently determine the optimal clustering
for all numbers of clusters less than or equal to $k$ essentially
because the most time-consuming part is determining $D$ and $B$ which
should be executed only once.

## Implementation

We implemented this dynamic programming algorithm in C++. The
implementation was built on source code from the R package
*Ckmeans.1d.dp* and we created a new R package *clustering.sc.dp*. In
the name of the package, *sc* and *dp* refer to sequential constraint
and dynamic programming, respectively. The open-source approach made it
possible to reuse the code from package *Ckmeans.1d.dp* but it was
beneficial for the original package as well: we suggested a minor change
in the code to speed up the code which was incorporated into
*Ckmeans.1d.dp* ($\geq$ version 3.3.0).

# Evaluation {#sec:evaluation}

## Optimality

If the sequential constraint is considered in clustering than the
optimal $\mathit{withinss}$ is usually larger than in the general case
without the constraint since the constraint excludes many possible
solutions. In order to compare our algorithm with general clustering
methods such as the $k$-means method, we generated a dataset where the
optima without and with sequential constraint are equal. For this
purpose, we created a totally ordered vector set where one vector is
simultaneously larger or smaller in each coordinate than another vector
($\forall i,j \in \{1,2,\ldots,n\} \forall k,l \in
\{1,2,\ldots,d\} x_{ik} < x_{jk} \implies x_{il} < x_{jl}$ where
$x_{yz}$ denote the $z$th coordinate of item $x_y$). We used a random
walk as a totally ordered vector set where the steps between subsequent
items were generated by using the exponential distribution. The
generated dataset consisted of 10,000 two-dimensional vectors.

We compared the dynamic programming algorithm with the `kmeans()`
function in R which provides the [@kmeans] implementation of $k$-means.
We ran the algorithms with different cluster numbers from 2 to 50. The
minimal $\mathit{withinss}$ found by $k$-means was always greater or
equal to the optimum value found by `clustering.sc.dp()`.

We used the relative difference in $\mathit{withinss}$ from the
`kmeans()` result to the optimal value produced by `clustering.sc.dp()`
for measuring deviation of the $k$-means result from the optimum.
FigureÂ [1](#figure:error) shows the relative difference as a function of
the cluster numbers. It can be seen that $k$-means is able to find the
optimum if the cluster number is at most 10. For larger cluster numbers,
its error starts increasing and the relative difference is more than 20%
if the cluster number is 50.

![Figure 1: The relative difference in $\mathit{withinss}$ from
`kmeans()` to the optimal value returned by `clustering.sc.dp()`. The
input data set of size 10 000 were generated as a random walk having a
step size that varies according to an exponential distribution with rate
1.0 in each coordinate.](error2.png){#figure:error width="100%"  alt="graphic without alt text"}

## Runtime

We tested the dynamic programming algorithm on inputs with different
sizes, dimensions and cluster numbers in order to find its performance
bounds and examine experimentally how the running time depends on the
input sizes. The simulations were run on a desktop computer with a
Pentium Dual-Core 2.93 GHz processor and 4 GB memory, running Windows 10
operation system. We generated multidimensional Gaussian random walks as
data sets for performance tests. The steps between subsequent items were
generated independently for each coordinate by using the Gaussian random
distribution with zero mean and standard deviation of 0.1.

In the first setting (FigureÂ [2](#figure:runtime)), runtime is obtained
as a function of input data size for running `clustering.sc.dp()`. The
size of the input varies from 1,000 to 30,000 with a step size of 1,000.
The input data consists of two-dimensional vectors. The number of
clusters is set to 2. The runtime increases quadratically in the number
of items to be clustered.

![Figure 2: Runtime as a function of the number of the items to be
clustered.](runtime.png){#figure:runtime width="100%"  alt="graphic without alt text"}

TableÂ [1](#table:time_size) presents some runtime data for a different
magnitude of the number of items in order to find performance bounds of
the method. One can see that the optimal clustering was found very
quickly if the number of items is 1,000, it took more than a second,
almost two and a half minutes, about four hours for 10,000, 100,000 and
one million items, respectively.

::: {#table:time_size}
  -----------------------------------------------------
  Size             1000   10,000   100,000   1,000,000
  --------------- ------ -------- --------- -----------
  Runtime (sec)    0.03    1.19    144.00    14,479.88

  -----------------------------------------------------

  : Table 1: Runtime for different numbers of the items to be clustered.
:::

In the second performance test we examine the dependency of the runtime
on the dimensions. All input data sets are of the same size 10,000 and
the dimensions of the vectors varies from 1 to 512. The dimensions are
doubled in each run. FigureÂ [3](#figure:time_dims) shows the results.
The algorithm runs less than a second if the input contains
one-dimensional vectors (i.e., scalars). The runtime increases linearly
with the dimension and it can be solved within two and a half minutes if
the dimension of the processed vectors is 512.

![Figure 3: Runtime as a function of the dimension of the items to be
clustered.](time_dims.png){#figure:time_dims width="100%"  alt="graphic without alt text"}

In the third performance test, the runtime is examined as a function of
the number of clusters. The number of clusters is between 1 and 25. The
input data set consist of 10,000 two-dimensional vectors. The black line
with circles in FigureÂ [4](#figure:time_backtrack) shows the result. The
runtime increases linearly with the number of clusters.

Finally, we compared the runtime of different functions within the
package. The input data were the same as in the previous setting. One
can see in FigureÂ [4](#figure:time_backtrack) that the runtime of
`findwithinss.sc.dp()` is slightly larger than the one of
`clustering.sc.dp()`. The runtime of `backtracking.sc.dp()` remains
small even for large cluster numbers. The package has three typical ways
of usage:

-   `clustering.sc.dp()` can be called when the number of clusters is
    known in advance.

-   `findwithinss.sc.dp()` can be called first and then
    `backtracking.sc.dp()` for a selected number of clusters.

-   `findwithinss.sc.dp()` can be called first and then
    `backtracking.sc.dp()` for all possible number of clusters.

The subsequent call of `findwithinss.sc.dp()` and `backtracking.sc.dp()`
is only slightly slower than calling `clustering.sc.dp()`. Furthermore,
the total runtime of calling `findwithinss.sc.dp()` for cluster number
$k$ and `backtracking.sc.dp()` for all cluster numbers less than or
equal to $k$ is less than the double of the runtime of
`clustering.sc.dp()` called for the same cluster number. This is much
faster than calling the clustering function $k$ times which would be
required without splitting `clustering.sc.dp()` into phases of finding
the optimal $\mathit{withinss}$ (`findwithinss.sc.dp()`) and
backtracking (`backtracking.sc.dp()`).

![Figure 4: Comparison of runtime as a function of number of clusters
between different functions provided by package *clustering.sc.dp*:
`clustering.sc.dp()`, `findwithinss.sc.dp()`, `backtracking.sc.dp()`. It
also contains the total running time of `backtracking.sc.dp()` when it
is called for all cluster numbers less than or equal to the specific
cluster number. ](time_backtrack.png){#figure:time_backtrack

# Introduction to the R package *clustering.sc.dp* {#sec:package}

R package *clustering.sc.dp* offers functions to perform optimal
clustering on multidimensional data with sequential constraint. Method
`clustering.sc.dp()` can find the optimal clustering if the number of
clusters is known. Otherwise, methods `findwithinss.sc.dp()` and
`backtracking.sc.dp()` can be used.

The following examples illustrate how to use the package. Function
`clustering.sc.dp()` outputs the same fields describing clustering as
`Ckmeans.1d.dp()` does in the original package:

-   $cluster$: a vector of cluster indices assigned to each element in
    $x$. Each cluster is indexed by an integer from 1 to $k$.

-   $centers$: a matrix whose rows represent the vectors of cluster
    centres (the average of the points within the cluster).

-   $\mathit{withinss}$: the within-cluster sum of squared distances for
    each cluster.

-   $size$: a vector containing the number of points in each cluster.

FigureÂ [5](#figure:clustering) visualizes the input data and the
clusters created by `clustering.sc.dp()`. See below for the R source
code of the example.

``` r
# Example1: clustering data generated from a random walk
x <- rbind(0, matrix(rnorm(99 * 2, 0, 0.1), nrow = 99, ncol = 2))
x <- apply(x, 2, cumsum)

k <- 2
result <- clustering.sc.dp(x, k)
plot(x, type = "b", col = result$cluster)
points(result$centers, pch = 24, bg = 1:k)
```

![Figure 5: Clustering data representing a two-dimensional random walk
into two clusters. The points to be clustered are represented by
circles. The clusters are indicated using different colours. The cluster
centres are denoted by triangles. ](sample1.png){#figure:clustering
width="100%"  alt="graphic without alt text"}

The next example demonstrates the usage of functions
`findwithinss.sc.dp()` and `backtracking.sc.dp()`. Similarly to the
previous example, it also processes data of a random walk. Function
`findwithinss.sc.dp()` finds optimal $\mathit{withinss}$ for a range of
cluster numbers. It returns a list with two components:

-   $\mathit{withinss}$: a vector of total within-cluster sum of squared
    distances of the optimal clusterings for each number of clusters
    less than or equal to `k`.

-   $\mathit{backtrack}$: backtrack data used by `backtracking.sc.dp()`.

In our example, the first cluster number where $\mathit{withinss}$ drops
below a threshold is selected as the number of clusters. Function
`backtracking.sc.dp()` outputs the optimal clustering for the selected
cluster number in the same format as `clustering.sc.dp()` does without
running the whole clustering process again
(FigureÂ [6](#figure:findwithinss)).

``` r
# Example2: clustering data generated from a random walk with small withinss
x <- rbind(0, matrix(rnorm(99 * 2, 0, 0.1), nrow = 99, ncol = 2))
x <- apply(x, 2, cumsum)

k <- 10
r <- findwithinss.sc.dp(x, k)

# select the first cluster number where withinss drops below a threshold
k_th <- which(r$twithinss <= 5.0)[1]

# backtrack
result <- backtracking.sc.dp(x, k_th, r$backtrack)
plot(x, type = "b", col = result$cluster)
points(result$centers, pch = 24, bg = 1:k_th)
```

![Figure 6: Clustering data representing a two-dimensional random walk.
The number of clusters was determined by the analysis of optimal
$\mathit{withinss}$ for a range of cluster numbers. It uses the same
notation as

# Summary {#sec:conclusion}

Clustering data with sequential constraint is a polynomial time solvable
variant of the clustering problem. The paper introduced a package
implementing a dynamic programming approach that finds the exact optimum
of the problem. The algorithm represents an extension of the
one-dimensional dynamic programming strategy of *Ckmeans.1d.dp* to
multiple dimensional spaces which has been an open problem in the paper
of [@Wang2011]. The package supports both cases when the exact number of
clusters is given and when the number of clusters is not known in
advance. It can also be used to evaluate approximation algorithms for
clustering with sequential constraint due to its optimality. The runtime
evaluations indicate how fast the algorithm can solve problems with
different sizes and parameters. Our future plan is to use the dynamic
programming method in video summarisation.
