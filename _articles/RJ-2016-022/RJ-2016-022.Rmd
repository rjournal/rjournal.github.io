title: 'clustering.sc.dp: Optimal Clustering with Sequential Constraint by Using Dynamic
  Programming'
abstract: 'The general clustering algorithms do not guarantee optimality because of
  the hardness of the problem. Polynomial-time methods can find the clustering corresponding
  to the exact optimum only in special cases. For example, the dynamic programming
  algorithm can solve the one-dimensional clustering problem, i.e., when the items
  to be clustered can be characterised by only one scalar number. Optimal one-dimensional
  clustering is provided by package Ckmeans.1d.dp in R. The paper shows a possible
  generalisation of the method implemented in this package to multidimensional data:
  the dynamic programming method can be applied to find the optimum clustering of
  vectors when only subsequent items may form a cluster. Sequential data are common
  in various fields including telecommunication, bioinformatics, marketing, transportation
  etc. The proposed algorithm can determine the optima for a range of cluster numbers
  in order to support the case when the number of clusters is not known in advance.'
