title: 'exPrior: An R Package for the Formulation of Ex-Situ Priors'
abstract: ' The [exPrior](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=exPrior) package implements
  a procedure for formulating informative priors of geostatistical properties for
  a target field site, called *ex-situ priors* and introduced in [@Cucchi2019]. The
  procedure uses a Bayesian hierarchical model to assimilate multiple types of data
  coming from multiple sites considered as similar to the target site. This prior
  summarizes the information contained in the data in the form of a probability density
  function that can be used to better inform further geostatistical investigations
  at the site. The formulation of the prior uses ex-situ data, where the data set
  can either be gathered by the user or come in the form of a structured database.
  The package is designed to be flexible in that regard. For illustration purposes
  and for easiness of use, the package is ready to be used with the worldwide hydrogeological
  parameter database (WWHYPDA) [@Comunian2009]. '
