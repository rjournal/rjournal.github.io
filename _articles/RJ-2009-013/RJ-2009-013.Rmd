::: article
Recursive partitioning methods are amongst the most popular and widely
used statistical learning tools for nonparametric regression and
classification. Random forests in particular, which can deal with large
numbers of predictor variables even in the presence of complex
interactions, are being applied successfully in many scientific fields

[see, e.g., @Lunetal:2004:gen; @Stretal:2009:PsyMeth and the references
therein for applications in genetics and social sciences].

Thus, it is not surprising that there is a variety of recursive
partitioning tools available in R (see
<http://CRAN.R-project.org/view=MachineLearning> for an overview).

The scope of recursive partitioning methods in R ranges from the
standard classification and regression trees available in *rpart*
[@rpart:pkg] to the reference implementation of random forests
[@Bre:2001] available in *randomForest*
[@randomForest:paper; @randomForest:pkg]. Both methods are popular in
applied research, and several extensions and refinements have been
suggested in the statistical literature in recent years.

One particularly important improvement was the introduction of unbiased
tree algorithms, which overcome the major weak spot of the classical
approaches available in *rpart* and *randomForest*: variable-selection
bias.

The term *variable-selection bias* refers to the fact that in standard
tree algorithms variable selection is biased in favor of variables
offering many potential cut-points, so that variables with many
categories and continuous variables are artificially preferred [see,
e.g, @KimLoh:2001; @Shi:2002; @Hotetal:2006; @Stretal:2007:CSDA for
details].

To overcome this weakness of the early tree algorithms, new algorithms
have been developed that do not artificially favor splits in variables
with many categories or continuous variables. In R such an unbiased tree
algorithm is available in the `ctree` function for conditional inference
trees in the *party* package [@Hotetal:2006]. The package also provides
a random forest implementation `cforest` based on unbiased trees, which
enables learning unbiased forests [@Stretal:2007:BMC].

Unbiased variable selection is the key to reliable prediction and
interpretability in both individual trees and forests. However, while a
single tree's interpretation is straightforward, in random forests an
extra effort is necessary to assess the importance of each predictor in
the complex ensemble of trees.

This issue is typically addressed by means of variable-importance
measures such as Gini importance and the "mean decrease in accuracy" or
"permutation" importance, available in *randomForest* in the
`importance()` function (with `type = 2` and `type = 1`, respectively).
Similarly, a permutation-importance measure for `cforest` is available
via `varimp()` in *party*.

Unfortunately, variable-importance measures in random forests are
subject to the same bias in favor of variables with many categories and
continuous variables that affects variable selection in single trees,
and also to a new source of bias induced by the resampling scheme
[@Stretal:2007:BMC]. Both problems can be addressed in *party* to
guarantee unbiased variable selection and variable importance for
predictor variables of different types.

Even though this refined approach can provide reliable
variable-importance measures in many applications, the original
permutation importance can be misleading in the case of correlated
predictors. Therefore, @Stretal:2008:BMC suggested a solution for this
problem in the form of a new, conditional permutation-importance
measure. Starting from version 0.9-994, this new measure is available in
the *party* package.

The rationale and usage of this new measure is outlined in the following
sections and illustrated by means of a toy example.

# Random forest variable-importance measures

Permutation importance, which is available in *randomForest* and
*party*, is based on a random permutation of the predictor variables, as
described in more detail below.

The alternative variable-importance measure available in *randomForest*,
Gini importance, is based on the Gini gain criterion employed in most
traditional classification tree algorithms. However, the Gini importance
has been shown to carry forward the bias of the underlying Gini-gain
splitting criterion [see, e.g.,
@KimLoh:2001; @Stretal:2007:CSDA; @Hotetal:2006] when predictor
variables vary in their number of categories or scale of measurement
[@Stretal:2007:BMC]. Therefore, it is not recommended in these
situations.

Permutation importance, on the other hand, is a reliable measure of
variable importance for uncorrelated predictors when sub-sampling
without replacement --- instead of bootstrap sampling --- and unbiased
trees are used in the construction of the forest [@Stretal:2007:BMC].
Accordingly, the default settings for the control parameters
`cforest_control` have been pre-defined to the default version
`cforest_unbiased` to guarantee sub-sampling without replacement and
unbiased individual trees in fitting random forests with the *party*
package.

The rationale of the original permutation-importance measure is the
following: By randomly permuting the predictor variable $X_j$, its
original association with the response $Y$ is broken. When the permuted
variable $X_j$, together with the remaining non-permuted predictor
variables, is used to predict the response for the out-of-bag
observations, the prediction accuracy (i.e., the number of correctly
classified observations in classification, or respectively the mean
squared error in regression) decreases substantially if the original
variable $X_j$ was associated with the response. Thus, @Bre:2001
suggests the difference in prediction accuracy before and after
permuting $X_j$, averaged over all trees, as a measure for variable
importance.

In standard implementations of random forests, such as *randomForest* in
R, an additional scaled version of permutation importance (often called
the $z$-score), which is computed by dividing the raw importance by its
standard error, is provided (for example by
`importance(obj, type = 2, scale = TRUE)` in *randomForest*). Note,
however, that the results of @StrZei:2008:COMPSTAT show that the z-score
is not suitable for significance tests and that raw importance has
better statistical properties.

# Why conditional importance? {#why-conditional-importance .unnumbered}

The original permutation-importance measure can, for reasons outlined
below, be considered as a marginal measure of importance. In this sense,
it has the same property as, e.g., a marginal correlation coefficient: A
variable that has no effect of its own, but is correlated with a
relevant predictor variable, can receive a high importance score.
Accordingly, empirical results [see @Stretal:2008:BMC and the references
therein] suggest that the original permutation-importance measure often
assigns higher scores to correlated predictors.

In contrast, partial correlation coefficients (like the coefficients in
linear regression models) measure the importance of a variable given the
other predictor variables in the model. The advantage of such a partial,
or conditional, approach is illustrated by means of a toy example:

The data set `readingSkills` is an artificial data set generated by
means of a linear model. The response variable contains hypothetical
scores on a test of reading skills for 200 school children. Potential
predictor variables in the data set are the age of the child, whether
the child is a native speaker of the test language and the shoe size of
the child.

Obviously, the latter is not a sensible predictor of reading skills (and
was actually simulated not to have any effect on the response) --- but
with respect to marginal (as opposed to partial) correlations, shoe size
is highly correlated with the test score. Of course this spurious
correlation is only due to the fact that both shoe size and test score
are associated with the underlying variable age.

In this simple problem, a linear model would be perfectly capable of
identifying the original coefficients of the predictor variables
(including the fact that shoe size has no effect on reading skills once
the truly relevant predictor variable age is included in the model).
However, the `cforest` permutation-importance measure is mislead by the
spurious correlation and assigns a rather high importance value to the
nonsense-variable shoe size:

``` r
> library("party")
> set.seed(42)
> readingSkills.cf <- cforest(score ~ .,
+    data = readingSkills, control =
+    cforest_unbiased(mtry = 2, ntree = 50))
```

``` r
> set.seed(42)
> varimp(readingSkills.cf)
```

``` r
nativeSpeaker           age      shoeSize
     12.62036      74.52034      17.97287
```

The reason for this odd behavior can be found in the way the predictor
variables are permuted in the computation of the importance measure:
@Stretal:2008:BMC show that the original approach, where one predictor
variable $X_j$ is permuted against both the response $Y$ and the
remaining (one or more) predictor variables $Z=X_{1}, \dots,
X_{j-1},X_{j+1}, \dots, X_{p}$, as illustrated in
Figure¬†[1](#scheme1:tab), corresponds to a pattern of independence
between $X_j$ and both $Y$ and $Z$.

From a theoretical point of view, this means that a high value of the
importance measure can be caused by a violation either of the
independence between $X_j$ and $Y$ or of the independence between $X_j$
and $Z$, even though the latter is not of interest here.

For practical applications, this means that a variable $X_j$ that is
correlated with an important predictor $Z$ can appear more important
than an uncorrelated variable, even if $X_j$ has no effect of its own.

The aim to reflect only the impact of $X_j$ itself in predicting the
response $Y$, rather than its correlations with other predictor
variables, can be better achieved by means of a conditional importance
measure in the spirit of a partial correlation: We want to measure the
association between $X_j$ and $Y$ given the correlation structure
between $X_j$ and the other predictor variables in the data set.

To meet this aim, @Stretal:2008:BMC suggest a conditional permutation
scheme, where $X_j$ is permuted only within groups of observations with
$Z=z$ in order to preserve the correlation structure between $X_j$ and
the other predictor variables, as illustrated in
Figure¬†[2](#scheme2:tab).

With this new, conditional permutation scheme, the importance measure is
able to reveal the spurious correlation between shoe size and reading
skills:

``` r
> set.seed(42)
> varimp(readingSkills.cf, conditional =
+    TRUE)
```

``` r
nativeSpeaker           age      shoeSize
    11.161887     44.388450      1.087162
```

Only by means of conditional importance it becomes clear that the
covariate native speaker is actually more relevant for predicting the
test score than shoe size is, whose conditional effect is negligible.

Thus, the conditional importance mimics the behavior of partial
correlations or linear regression coefficients, the interpretation of
which many readers may be more familiar. However, whether a marginal or
conditional importance measure is to be preferred depends on the actual
research question.

Current research also investigates the impact that the choice of the
tuning parameter `mtry`, which regulates the number of randomly
preselected predictor variables that can be chosen in each split [cf.
@Stretal:2008:BMC], and parameters regulating the depth of the trees
have on variable importance.

# How is the conditioning grid defined technically?

Conditioning is straightforward whenever the variables to be conditioned
on, $Z$, are categorical [cf., e.g., @Nasetal:2004]. However,
conditioning on continuous variables, which may entail as many different
values as observations in the sample, would produce cells with very
sparse counts --- which would make permuting the values of $X_j$ within
each cell rather pointless. Thus, in order to create cells of reasonable
size for conditioning, continuous variables need to be discretized.

As a straightforward discretization strategy for random forests,
@Stretal:2008:BMC suggest defining the conditioning grid by means of the
partition of the feature space induced by each individual tree. This
grid can be used to conditionally permute the values of $X_j$ within
cells defined by combinations of $Z$, where $Z$ can contain potentially
large sets of covariates of different scales of measurement.

The main advantages of this approach are that this partition has already
been learned from the data during model fitting, that it can contain
splits in categorical, ordered and continuous predictor variables, and
that it can thus serve as an internally available means for discretizing
the feature space. For ease of computation, the conditioning grid
employed in `varimp` uses all cut-points as bisectors of the sample
space [the same approach is followed by @Nasetal:2004].

The set of variables $Z$ to be conditioned on should contain all
variables that are correlated with the current variable of interest
$X_j$. In the `varimp` function, this is assured by the small default
value 0.2 of the `threshold` argument: By default, all variables whose
correlation with $X_j$ meets the condition
$1  -  p\mathrm{-value} > 0.2$ are used for conditioning. A larger value
of `threshold` would have the effect that only those variables that are
strongly correlated with $X_j$ would be used for conditioning, but would
also lower the computational burden.

Note that the same permutation tests that are used for split selection
in the tree building process [@Hotetal:2006] are used here to measure
the association between $X_j$ and the remaining covariates.

# A short recipe for fitting random forests and computing variable importance measures with R

To conclude, we would like to summarize the application of conditional
variable importance and general issues in fitting random forests with R.
Depending on certain characteristics of your data set, we suggest the
following approaches:

-   If all predictor variables are of the same type (for example: all
    continuous or all unordered categorical with the same number of
    categories), use either `randomForest` (*randomForest*) or `cforest`
    (*party*). While `randomForest` is computationally faster, `cforest`
    is safe even for variables of different types.

    For predictor variables of the same type, Gini importance,
    `importance(obj, type = 2)`, or permutation importance,
    `importance(obj, type = 1)`, available for `randomForest`, and
    permutation importance, `varimp(obj)`, available for `cforest`, are
    all adequate importance measures.

-   If the predictor variables are of different types (for example:
    different scales of measurement, different numbers of categories),
    use `cforest` (*party*) with the default option
    `controls = cforest_unbiased` and permutation importance
    `varimp(obj)`.

-   If the predictor variables are correlated, depending on your
    research question, conditional importance, available via
    `varimp(obj, conditional = TRUE)` for `cforest` (*party*), can add
    to the understanding of your data.

General remarks:

-   Note that the default settings for `mtry` differ in `randomForest`
    and `cforest`: In `randomForest` the default setting for
    classification, e.g., is ` floor(sqrt(ncol(x)))`, while in `cforest`
    it is fixed to the value 5 for technical reasons.

-   Always check whether you get the same results with a different
    random seed before interpreting the variable importance ranking!

    If the ranking of even the top-scoring predictor variables depends
    on the choice of the random seed, increase the number of trees
    (argument `ntree` in `randomForest` and `cforest_control`).
