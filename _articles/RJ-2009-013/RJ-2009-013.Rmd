title: Party on!
abstract: Recursive partitioning methods are amongst the most popular and widely used
  statistical learning tools for nonparametric regression and classification. Especially
  random forests, that can deal with large numbers of predictor variables even in
  the presence of complex interactions, are being applied successfully in many scientific
  fields (see, e.g., ??, and the references therein for applications in genetics and
  social sciences). Thus, it is not surprising that there is a variety of recursive
  partitioning tools available in R (see http://CRAN.R-project.org/view=MachineLearning
  for an overview).
