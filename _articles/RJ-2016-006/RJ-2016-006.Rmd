title: 'Variable Clustering in High-Dimensional Linear Regression: The R Package clere'
abstract: Dimension reduction is one of the biggest challenges in high-dimensional
  regression models. We recently introduced a new methodology based on variable clustering
  as a means to reduce dimen sionality. We present here the R package clere that implements
  some refinements of this methodology. An overview of the package functionalities
  as well as examples to run an analysis are described. Numerical experiments on real
  data were performed to illustrate the good predictive performance of our parsimonious
  method compared to standard dimension reduction approaches.
