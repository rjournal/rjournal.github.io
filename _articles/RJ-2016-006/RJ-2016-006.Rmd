# Introduction

High dimensionality is increasingly ubiquitous in numerous scientific
fields including genetics, economics and physics. Reducing the
dimensionality is a challenge that most statistical methodologies must
meet not only to remain interpretable but also to achieve reliable
predictions. In linear regression models, dimension reduction techniques
often correspond to variable selection methods. Approaches for variable
selection are already implemented in publicly available, open-source
software, e.g., the well-known R packages
[*glmnet*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=glmnet) [@glmnet-ref] and
[*spikeslab*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=spikeslab)
[@spikeslab-ref]. The R package *glmnet* implements the Elastic net
methodology [@zou2005], which is a generalization of both the LASSO
[@tibshirani1996] and the ridge regression [RR; @hoerl1970]. The R
package *spikeslab* in turn, implements the Spike and Slab methodology
[@ishwaran2005], which is a Bayesian approach for variable selection.

Dimension reduction cannot, however, be restricted to variable
selection. Indeed, the field can be extended to include approaches which
aim at creating surrogate covariates that summarize the information
contained in initial covariates. Since the emblematic principal
component regression [PCR; @joliffe82], many other methods spread in the
recent literature. As specific examples, we may refer to the OSCAR
methodology [@bondell2008], or the PACS methodology [@pacs2013] which is
a generalization of the latter approach. Those methods mainly proposed
variable clustering within a regression model as a way to reduce the
dimensionality. Despite their theoretical and practical appeal,
implementations of those methods were often proposed only through MATLAB
[@MATLABR2014b] or R scripts, limiting thus the flexibility and the
computational efficiency of their use. The CLusterwise Effect REgression
(CLERE) methodology [@yengo2013], was recently introduced as a novel
methodology for simultaneous variable clustering and regression. The
CLERE methodology is based on the assumption that each regression
coefficient is an unobserved random variable sampled from a mixture of
Gaussian distributions with an arbitrary number $g$ of components. In
addition, all components in the mixture are assumed to have different
means ($b_1,\ldots,b_g$) and equal variances $\gamma^2$.

In this paper, we propose two new features for the CLERE model. First,
the stochastic EM (SEM) algorithm is proposed as a more computationally
efficient alternative to the Monte Carlo EM (MCEM) algorithm previously
introduced in @yengo2013. Secondly, the CLERE model is enhanced with the
possibility of constraining the first component to have its mean equal
to 0, i.e. $b_1 = 0$. This enhancement is mainly aimed at facilitating
the interpretation of the model. Indeed when $b_1$ is set to $0$,
variables assigned to the cluster associated with $b_1$ might be
considered less relevant than other variables provided $\gamma^2$ is
small enough. Those two new features were implemented in the R package
[*clere*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=clere) [@clere]. The core
of the package is a C++ program interfaced with R using the R packages
[*Rcpp*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=Rcpp) [@Rcpp-ref] and
[*RcppEigen*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=RcppEigen)
[@RcppEigen-ref]. The R package *clere* can be downloaded from the
Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN) at
<https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=clere>.

The outline of the present paper is the following. In the next section
the definition of the model is recalled and the strategy to estimate the
model parameters is explained. Afterwards, the main functionalities of
the R package *clere* are presented. Real data analyses are then
provided, aiming at illustrating the good predictive performances of
CLERE, with noticeable parsimony ability, compared to standard dimension
reduction methods. Finally, perspectives and further potential
improvements of the package are discussed in the last section.

# Model definition and notation {#sec:modeldescription}

Our model is defined by the following hierarchical relationships:

$$\label{eq:clere0}
    \left\{
    \begin{matrix}{l}
      y_i \sim\mathcal{N}\left(\beta_0+\sum_{j=1}^{p}{\beta_j x_{ij}},\sigma^2\right),\\
      \beta_j |\mathbf{z}_j  \sim \mathcal{N}\left(\sum^{g}_{k=1}{ b_k z_{jk} },\gamma^2  \right),\\
      \mathbf{z}_j = \left(z_{j1},\ldots,z_{jg} \right)\sim \mathcal{M}\left(1,\pi_1,\ldots,\pi_g\right)\text{,}
    \end{matrix}
    \right.  (\#eq:clere0)  $$

where $\mathcal{N}(\mu,\sigma^2)$ is the normal distribution with mean
$\mu$ and variance $\sigma^2$,
$\mathcal{M}\left(1,\pi_1,\ldots,\pi_g\right)$ the one-order multinomial
distribution with parameters $\mathbf
  \pi=\left(\pi_1,\ldots,\pi_g \right)$, where, $\forall$ $k=1,\ldots,g$
$\pi_k>0$ and $\sum^g_{k=1}{\pi_k}=1$[, and $\beta_0$ is a constant
term]{style="color: black"}. For an individual $i=1,\ldots,n$, $y_i$ is
the response and $x_{ij}$ is an observed value for the $j$-th covariate.
$\beta_j$ is the regression coefficient associated with the $j$-th
covariate ($j=1,\ldots,p$), which is assumed to follow a mixture of $g$
Gaussians. The variable $\mathbf{z}_j$ indicates from which mixture
component $\beta_j$ is drawn ($z_{jk}=1$ if $\beta_j$ comes from
component $k$ of the mixture, $z_{jk}=0$ otherwise). Let's note that
model (\@ref(eq:clere0)) can be considered as a variable selection-like
model by constraining the model parameter $b_1$ to be equal to 0.
Indeed, assuming that one of the components is centered in zero means
that a cluster of regression coefficients have null expectation, and
thus that the corresponding variables are not significant for explaining
the response variable. This functionality is available in the package.

Let $\mathbf \beta = \left(\beta_1,\ldots,\beta_p \right)$,
$\mathbf y = (y_1,\ldots ,y_n)'$, $\mathbf{X} = (x_{ij})$,
$\mathbf Z = (z_{jk})$, $\mathbf b = (b_1,\ldots, b_g)'$ and
$\mathbf \pi= (\pi_1,\ldots, \pi_g)'$. Moreover,
$\log p(\mathbf y|\mathbf X;\mathbf \theta)$ denotes the log-likelihood
of model (\@ref(eq:clere0)) assessed for the parameter vector
$\mathbf \theta = \left(\beta_0,\mathbf b,\mathbf\pi,\sigma^2,\gamma^2\right)$.
Model (\@ref(eq:clere0)) can be interpreted as a Bayesian approach.
However, to be fully Bayesian a prior distribution for parameter
$\mathbf \theta$ would have been necessary. Instead, we proposed to
estimate $\mathbf \theta$ by maximizing the (marginal) log-likelihood,
$\log p(\mathbf{y}|\mathbf{X};\mathbf \theta)$. This partially Bayesian
approach is referred to as *Empirical Bayes* [EB; @casella1985]. Let
$\mathcal{Z}$ be the set of $p\times g$-matrices partitioning $p$
covariates into $g$ groups. Those matrices are defined as
$$\mathbf Z = \left(z_{jk}\right)_{1\leq j \leq p, 1\leq k \leq g} \in
  \mathcal{Z} \Leftrightarrow \forall j=1,\ldots,p\text{ }
  \begin{cases}
    \exists!\text{ } k\text{ such as }z_{jk} = 1\\
    \text{For all }k'\neq k\text{ }z_{jk'}=0.
  \end{cases}$$ The log-likelihood
$\log p(\mathbf y|\mathbf X;\mathbf \theta)$ is defined as

$$\label{eq:likelihood}
  \log
  p(\mathbf y|\mathbf X;\mathbf \theta)
  = \log\left[ \sum_{\mathbf Z\in\mathcal{Z}} {\int_{\mathbb{R}^p}{p(\mathbf
	y,\mathbf \beta,\mathbf Z|\mathbf X;\mathbf \theta)}\mathrm{d}\mathbf \beta }\right]\text{.}  (\#eq:likelihood)  $$

Since it requires integrating over $\mathcal{Z}$ with cardinality $g^p$,
evaluating the likelihood becomes rapidly computationally unaffordable.

Nonetheless, maximum likelihood estimation is still achievable using the
expectation maximization (EM) algorithm [@dempster1977]. The latter
algorithm is an iterative method which starts with an initial estimate
of the parameter and updates this estimate until convergence. Each
iteration of the algorithm consists of two steps, denoted as the *E* and
the *M steps*. At each iteration $d$ of the algorithm, the *E step*
consists in calculating the expectation of the log-likelihood of the
complete data (observed + unobserved) with respect to
$p(\mathbf \beta,\mathbf Z|\mathbf y,\mathbf X;\mathbf
\theta^{(d)})$, the conditional distribution of the unobserved data
given the observed data, and the value of the parameter at the current
iteration, $\mathbf \theta^{(d)}$. This expectation, often denoted as
$Q(\mathbf \theta|\mathbf \theta^{(d)})$ is then maximized with respect
to $\mathbf \theta$ at the *M step*.

In model (\@ref(eq:clere0)), the *E step* is analytically intractable. A
broad literature devoted to intractable *E steps* recommends the use of
a stochastic approximation of $Q(\mathbf \theta|\mathbf \theta^{(d)})$
through Monte Carlo (MC) simulations [@wei1990; @levine2001]. This
approach is referred to as the MCEM algorithm. Besides, mean-field-type
approximations are also proposed [@govaert2008; @mariadassou2010].
Despite their computational appeal, the latter approximations do not
generally ensure convergence to the maximum likelihood
[@Gunawardana05convergencetheorems]. Alternatively, the SEM algorithm
[@celeux:inria-00074164] was introduced as a stochastic version of the
EM algorithm. In this algorithm, the *E step* is replaced with a
simulation step (*S step*) that consists in generating a complete sample
by simulating the unobserved data using
$p(\mathbf \beta,\mathbf Z|\mathbf y,\mathbf X;\mathbf \theta^{(d)})$
providing thus a sample $(\mathbf \beta^{(d)},\mathbf Z^{(d)})$. Note
that the Monte Carlo algorithm we use to perform this simulation is the
Gibbs sampler. After the *S step* follows the *M step* which consists in
maximizing
$p(\mathbf \beta^{(d)},\mathbf Z^{(d)}|\mathbf y,\mathbf X;\mathbf \theta)$
with respect to $\mathbf \theta$. Alternating those two steps generates
a sequence $\left(\mathbf \theta^{(d)}\right)$, which is a Markov chain
whose stationary distribution (when it exists) concentrates around the
local maxima of the likelihood.

# Estimation and model selection {#sec:algos}

[In this section, two algorithms for model inference are presented: the
Monte-Carlo Expectation Maximization (MCEM) algorithm and the Stochastic
Expectation Maximization (SEM) algorithm. The section starts with the
initialization strategy common to both algorithms and continues with the
detailed description of each algorithm. Then, model selection (for
choosing $g$) and variable selection are
discussed.]{style="color: black"}

## Initialization

The two algorithms presented in this section are initialized using a
primary estimate ${\beta_j}^{(0)}$ of each $\beta_j$. The latter can be
chosen either at random, or obtained from univariate regression
coefficients or penalized approaches like LASSO and ridge regression.
For large SEM or MCEM chains, initialization is not a critical issue.
The choice of the initialization strategy is therefore made to speed up
the convergence of the chains. A Gaussian mixture model with $g$
component(s) is then fitted using
${\mathbf \beta}^{(0)} = \left(\beta_1^{(0)},\ldots,{\beta}^{(0)}_p\right)$
as observed data to produce starting values $\mathbf{b}^{(0)}$,
$\mathbf \pi^{(0)}$ and ${\gamma^2}^{(0)}$ respectively for parameters
$\mathbf{b}$, $\boldsymbol{\pi}$ and ${\gamma^2}$. Using maximum a
posteriori (MAP) clustering, an initial partition
$\mathbf{Z}^{(0)} =  \left(z^{(0)}_{jk}\right)\in\mathcal{Z}$ is
obtained as
$$\forall j\in\{1,\ldots,p\},\text{ }z^{(0)}_{jk} = \begin{cases}
    1 & \text{ if }k = {argmin}_{k'\in\{1,\ldots,g\}}{\left({\beta_j}^{(0)}-b^{(0)}_{k'}\right)^2},\\
    0 & \text{otherwise.}
  \end{cases}$$ $\beta_0$ and $\sigma^2$ are initialized using
${\mathbf \beta}^{(0)}$ as follows: $$\beta_0^{(0)}  =
  \frac{1}{n}\sum^{n}_{i=1}{\left(y_i-\sum^{p}_{j=1}{\beta^{(0)}_j x_{ij}}\right)}
  \text{ and }
  {\sigma^2}^{(0)}  =
  \frac{1}{n}\sum^{n}_{i=1}{\left(y_i-\beta_0^{(0)}
  -\sum^{p}_{j=1}{\beta^{(0)}_j x_{ij}}\right)^2} .$$

## MCEM algorithm {#sec:mcem}

### The stochastic approximation of the E step

Suppose at iteration $d$ of the algorithm that we have
$\left\{\left(\mathbf \beta^{(1,d)},\mathbf Z^{(1,d)}\right),\ldots,
  \left(\mathbf \beta^{(M,d)},\mathbf Z^{(M,d)}\right)\right\}$, $M$
samples from
$p\left(\mathbf \beta,\mathbf Z|\mathbf y,\mathbf X;\mathbf  \theta^{(d)}\right)$.
Then the MC approximation of the *E step* can be written as

$$\label{eq:approxEstep}
    Q\left(\mathbf \theta|\mathbf \theta^{(d)}\right) = \mathbb{E}\left[\log p(\mathbf{y},\mathbf \beta,\mathbf{Z}|\mathbf{X};\mathbf \theta^{(d)}) |\mathbf{y},\mathbf{X};\mathbf \theta^{(d)}\right] \approx \frac{1}{M}\sum^{M}_{m=1}{\log p(\mathbf{y},\mathbf \beta^{(m,d)},\mathbf{Z}^{(m,d)}|\mathbf{X};\mathbf \theta^{(d)})}\text{.}  (\#eq:approxEstep)  $$

Sampling from
$p\left(\mathbf \beta,\mathbf Z|\mathbf y,\mathbf X;\mathbf \theta^{(d)}\right)$
is not straightforward. However, we can use a Gibbs sampling scheme to
simulate unobserved data, taking advantage of
$p\left(\mathbf \beta|\mathbf Z,\mathbf y,\mathbf X;\mathbf \theta^{(d)}\right)$
and
$p\left(\mathbf Z|\mathbf \beta,\mathbf y,\mathbf X;\mathbf \theta^{(d)}\right)$
from which it is easy to simulate. These distributions, i.e., Gaussian
and multinomial, respectively, are described below in Equations
(\@ref(eq:gibbs1)) and (\@ref(eq:gibbs2)).

$$\label{eq:gibbs1}
    \left\{
    \begin{matrix}
      \mathbf \beta|\mathbf{Z,y,X};\mathbf \theta^{(d)} \sim \mathcal{N}\left(\mathbf \mu^{(d)},\mathbf \Sigma^{(d)} \right),\\
      \mathbf \mu^{(d)} = \left[ \mathbf{X'X} +
      \frac{{\sigma^2}^{(d)}}{{\gamma^2}^{(d)}}\text{I}_{p} \right]^{-1}\mathbf{X}'\left(\mathbf{y}-\beta^{(d)}_0\mathbf 1_p\right) +
      \frac{{\sigma^2}^{(d)}}{{\gamma^2}^{(d)}}\left[ \mathbf{X'X} +  \frac{{\sigma^2}^{(d)}}{{\gamma^2}^{(d)}}\text{I}_{p} \right]^{-1}\mathbf{Zb}^{(d)},\\
      \mathbf \Sigma^{(d)} = {\sigma^2}^{(d)}\left[ \mathbf{X'X} + \frac{{\sigma^2}^{(d)}}{{\gamma^2}^{(d)}}\text{I}_{p} \right]^{-1},
    \end{matrix}
    \right.  (\#eq:gibbs1)  $$

and, noting that
$p\left(\mathbf Z|\mathbf \beta,\mathbf y,\mathbf X;\mathbf \theta^{(d)}\right)$
does not depend on $\mathbf{X}$ nor $\mathbf{y}$,

$$\label{eq:gibbs2}
    p\left(z_{jk}=1|\mathbf \beta; \mathbf \theta^{(d)}\right) \propto \pi^{(d)}_k\exp\left(-\frac{\left(\beta_j - b^{(d)}_k\right)^2}{2{\gamma^2}^{(d)}} \right).  (\#eq:gibbs2)  $$

In Equation (\@ref(eq:gibbs1)), $\text{I}_{p}$ and $\mathbf 1_p$ stand
for the identity matrix with dimension $p$ and the vector of
$\mathbb{R}^p$ where all elements are equal to 1. To efficiently sample
from
$p\left(\mathbf \beta|\mathbf Z,\mathbf y,\mathbf X;\mathbf \theta^{(d)}\right)$
a preliminary singular vector decomposition of matrix $\mathbf X$ is
necessary. Once this decomposition is performed the overall complexity
of the approximate *E step* is $\mathcal{O}\left[M(p^2+pg)\right]$.

### The M step

Using the $M$ draws obtained by Gibbs sampling at iteration $d$, the *M
step* is straightforward as detailed in Equations (\@ref(eq:mstep-pi))
to (\@ref(eq:mstep-sigma)). The overall computational complexity of that
step is $\mathcal{O}\left( Mpg\right)$.

$$ \begin{aligned} \label{eq:mstep_pi}
    \pi^{(d+1)}_k &= \frac{1}{Mp}\sum^{M}_{m=1}{  \sum^{p}_{j=1}{z^{(m,d)}_{jk} } }\text{,}
  \end{aligned} (\#eq:mstep-pi)  $$ 
   
$$\begin{aligned} \label{eq:mstep_b} 
    b^{(d+1)}_k &= \frac{1}{Mp\pi^{(d+1)}_k}\sum^{M}_{m=1}{\sum^{p}_{j=1}{ z^{(m,d)}_{jk} \beta_{j}^{(m,d)} } }\text{,} \end{aligned}  (\#eq:mstep-b)  $$ 

$$\begin{aligned}
    \label{eq:mstep_gamma}
    {\gamma^2}^{(d+1)} &=
    \frac{1}{Mp}\sum^{M}_{m=1}{\sum^{p}_{j=1}{  \sum^{g}_{k=1}{z^{(m,d)}_{jk}    \left(\beta_{j}^{(m,d)}-b^{(d+1)}_k\right)^2} } }\text{,} \end{aligned}  (\#eq:mstep-gamma)  $$ 

$$\begin{aligned} \label{eq:mstep_beta0}
    \beta^{(d+1)}_0 &= \frac{1}{n}\sum^{n}_{i=1}{ \left[y_i-\sum^{p}_{j=1}{\left(\frac{1}{M}\sum^{M}_{m=1}{\beta^{(m,d)}_j} \right)x_{ij}} \right]}\text{,} \end{aligned}  (\#eq:mstep-beta0)  $$ 

$$\begin{aligned}
    \label{eq:mstep_sigma}
    {\sigma^2}^{(d+1)} &= \frac{1}{nM}\sum^{M}_{m=1}{\sum^{n}_{i=1}{ \left(y_i - \beta^{(d+1)}_0-\sum^{p}_{j=1}{ \beta^{(m,d)}_j x_{ij} }\right)^2  } }\text{.} \end{aligned}  (\#eq:mstep-sigma)  $$

## SEM algorithm

In most situations, the SEM algorithm can be considered as a special
case of the MCEM algorithm [@celeux:inria-00074164], obtained by setting
$M=1$. In model (\@ref(eq:clere0)), such a direct derivation leads to an
algorithm where the computational complexity remains quadratic with
respect to $p$. To reduce that complexity, we propose a SEM algorithm
based on the integrated complete data likelihood
$p(\mathbf y, \mathbf Z|\mathbf X;\mathbf \theta)$ rather than
$p(\mathbf y,\mathbf \beta,\mathbf Z|\mathbf X;\mathbf \theta)$. A
closed form of $p(\mathbf y, \mathbf Z|\mathbf X;\mathbf \theta)$ is
available and given in the following.

### Closed form of the integrated complete data likelihood

Let the SVD decomposition of matrix $\mathbf X$ be $\mathbf {USV}'$,
where $\mathbf U$ and $\mathbf V$ are respectively $n \times n$ and
$p \times p$ orthogonal matrices, and $\mathbf S$ is a $n \times p$
rectangular diagonal matrix where the diagonal terms are the eigenvalues
$\left(\lambda^2_1,\ldots,\lambda^2_n\right)$ of matrix $\mathbf {XX}'$.
We now define $\mathbf X^u = \mathbf {U}'\mathbf{X}$ and
$\mathbf y^u = \mathbf {U}'\mathbf{y}$. Let $\mathbf M$ be the
$n\times (g+1)$ matrix where the first column is made of 1's and where
the additional columns are those of matrix $\mathbf X^u \mathbf Z$. Let
also $\mathbf t=\left(\beta_0,\mathbf b\right)\in \mathbb{R}^{(g+1)}$
and $\mathbf R$ be a $n\times n$ diagonal matrix where the $i$-th
diagonal term equals $\sigma^2 + \gamma^2\lambda^2_i$. With these
notations we can express the complete data likelihood integrated over
$\mathbf \beta$ as

$$\begin{aligned}
      \label{eq:ICDLL}
      \log p\left(\mathbf{y,Z}|\mathbf{X};\mathbf \theta\right)  = -\frac{n}{2}\log\left( 2\pi\right)-\frac{1}{2}\sum^{n}_{i=1}{\log\left( \sigma^2 + \gamma^2\lambda^2_i\right)}-\frac{1}{2}\left(\mathbf{y}^u-\mathbf {Mt}\right)'\mathbf R^{-1}\left(\mathbf{y}^u-\mathbf {Mt}\right) \\
        + \sum^{p}_{j=1}{\sum^{g}_{k=1}{z_{jk}\log \pi_k}}\text{.} \end{aligned}  (\#eq:ICDLL)  $$

### Simulation step

To sample from $p\left(\mathbf{Z}|\mathbf{y,X};\mathbf \theta\right)$ we
use a Gibbs sampling strategy based on the conditional distributions
$p\left(\mathbf{z}_j|\mathbf y,\mathbf Z^{-j}, \mathbf X;\mathbf \theta\right)$,
$\mathbf
    Z^{-j}$ denoting the set of cluster membership indicators for all
covariates but the $j$-th. Let $\mathbf w^{-j} =
    \left(w^{-j}_1,\ldots,w^{-j}_n\right)'$, where $w_i^{-j} =
    y^u_i-\beta_0 - \sum_{l\neq j}{\sum^{g}_{k=1}{z_{lk} x^u_{il}
	b_k}}$. The conditional distribution $p(z_{jk} =
    1|\mathbf{Z}^{-j},\mathbf{y},\mathbf{X};\mathbf \theta)$ can be
written as

$$\label{eq:Gibbs}
      p(z_{jk} = 1|\mathbf{Z}^{-j},\mathbf{y},\mathbf{X};\mathbf \theta) \propto
      \pi_k\exp\left[-\frac{b^2_k}{2} \left(\mathbf{x}^{u}_j\right)'\mathbf{R}^{-1} \mathbf{x}^{u}_j+b_k \left(\mathbf{w}^{-j}\right)'\mathbf{R}^{-1}\mathbf x^{u}_j\right]\text{,}  (\#eq:Gibbs)  $$

where $\mathbf{x}^{u}_j$ is the $j$-th column of $\mathbf X^u$. In the
classical SEM algorithm, convergence to
$p\left(\mathbf{Z}|\mathbf{y,X};\mathbf \theta\right)$ should be reached
before updating $\mathbf \theta$. However, a valid inference can still
be ensured in settings when $\mathbf \theta$ is updated only after one
or few Gibbs iterations. These approaches are referred to as SEM-Gibbs
algorithm [@biernacki2013]. The overall computational complexity of the
simulation step is $\mathcal{O}\left( npg\right)$, i.e., it is linear in
$p$ and not quadratic any more, in contrast to the previous MCEM.

To improve the mixing of the generated Markov chain, we start the
simulation step at each iteration by creating a random permutation of
$\left\{1,\ldots,p\right\}$. Then, according to the order defined by
that permutation, we update each $z_{jk}$ using $p(z_{jk} =
    1|\mathbf{Z}^{-j},\mathbf{y},\mathbf{X};\mathbf \theta)$.

### Maximization step

$\log p\left(\mathbf{y,Z}|\mathbf{X};\mathbf \theta\right)$ corresponds
to the marginal log-likelihood of a linear mixed model
[@searle1992variance], which can be written as

$$\label{eq:mixedmodel0}
      \mathbf{y}^u = \mathbf M \mathbf t + \mathbf {\lambda v} + \mathbf \varepsilon  (\#eq:mixedmodel0)  $$

where $\mathbf v$ is an unobserved random vector such as $\mathbf v \sim
    \mathcal{N}\left(0,\gamma^2\text{I}_{n}\right)$,
$\mathbf \varepsilon \sim
    \mathcal{N}\left(0,\sigma^2\text{I}_{n}\right)$ and
$\mathbf \lambda =
    \text{diag}\left(\lambda_1,\ldots,\lambda_n\right)$. The estimation
of the parameters of model (\@ref(eq:mixedmodel0)) can be performed
using the EM algorithm, as in @searle1992variance. We adapt below the EM
equations defined in @searle1992variance, using our notations. At
iteration $s$ of the internal EM algorithm, we define $\mathbf R^{(s)} =
    {\sigma^2}^{(s)}\mathbf I_{n} + {\gamma^2}^{(s)}\mathbf \lambda'\mathbf
    \lambda$. The detailed *internal E* and *M steps* are given below.

#### Internal E step

$$\begin{align}
      v^{(s)}_\sigma & =  \mathbb{E}\left[\left(\mathbf{y}^u - \mathbf{Mt}^{(s)} - \mathbf {\lambda v}\right)'\left(\mathbf{y}^u - \mathbf{Mt}^{(s)} - \mathbf {\lambda v}\right)|\mathbf{y}^u\right] \\
      & =  {\sigma^4}^{(s)}\left(\mathbf{y}^u - \mathbf{Mt}^{(s)}\right)'\mathbf R^{(s)}\mathbf R^{(s)}\left(\mathbf{y}^u - \mathbf{Mt}^{(s)}\right)  + n\times {\sigma^2}^{(s)} - {\sigma^4}^{(s)} \sum^{n}_{i=1}{\frac{1}{{\sigma^2}^{(s)}+{\gamma^2}^{(s)}\lambda^2_i}}\text{.}\\
      v^{(s)}_\gamma & =  \mathbb{E}\left[\mathbf v'\mathbf v|\mathbf{y}^u\right] \\

      \mathbf h^{(s)} & =  \mathbb{E}\left[\mathbf{y}^u - \mathbf {\lambda v}  |\mathbf{y}^u\right]  = \mathbf{Mt}^{(s)} + {\sigma^2}^{(s)} \{R^{(s)}\}^{-1} \left(\mathbf{y}^u - \mathbf{Mt}^{(s)}\right)\text{.}
\end{align} $$

#### Internal M step

$$\begin{aligned}
      {\sigma^2}^{(s+1)} &= v^{(s)}_\sigma / n\text{,}\\
      {\gamma^2}^{(s+1)} &= v^{(s)}_\gamma / n\text{,}\\
      \mathbf{t}^{(s+1)} &= \left[\mathbf M'\mathbf M\right]^{-1}\mathbf M'\mathbf h^{(s)}\text{.} \end{aligned}$$ 
  
  Given a non-negative user-specified threshold $\delta$
and a maximum number $N_{\max}$ of iterations, *Internal E* and *M
steps* are alternated until
$$|\log p\left(\mathbf{y,Z}|\mathbf{X};\mathbf \theta^{(s)}\right)- \log p\left(\mathbf{y,Z}|\mathbf{X};\mathbf \theta^{(s+1)}\right)|<\delta\text{ or } s = N_{\max}\text{.}$$
The computational complexity of the *M step* is
$\mathcal{O}\left( g^3 + ngN_{max}\right)$, thus not involving $p$.

### Attracting and absorbing states

-   *Absorbing states*. The SEM algorithm described above defines a
    Markov chain where the stationary distribution is concentrated
    around values of $\mathbf \theta$ corresponding to local maxima of
    the likelihood function. This chain has absorbing states in values
    of $\mathbf \theta$ such as $\sigma^2=0$ or $\gamma^2=0$. In fact,
    the *internal M step* reveals that updated values for $\sigma^2$ and
    $\gamma^2$ are proportional to previous values of those parameters.

-   *Attracting states*. We empirically observed that attraction around
    $\sigma^2=0$ was quite frequent when using the MCEM algorithm,
    especially when $p>n$ and when the number $M$ of draws was small. We
    therefore advocate to use at least 5 draws ($M \geq 5$ using option
    `nsamp` in the function `fitClere`).

## Model selection

Once the MLE $\widehat{\mathbf \theta}$ is calculated (using one of the
algorithms), the maximum log-likelihood and the posterior clustering
matrix
$\mathbb{E}\left[\mathbf Z|\mathbf{y, X};\widehat{\mathbf \theta} \right]$
are approximated using MC simulations based on Equations
(\@ref(eq:ICDLL)) and (\@ref(eq:Gibbs)). The approximate maximum
log-likelihood $\widehat{l}$, is then utilized to calculate AIC
[@akaike1974] and BIC [@schwarz1978] for model selection. In model
(\@ref(eq:clere0)), those criteria can be written as 

$$\begin{aligned}
    \text{BIC} &= -2\widehat{l} + 2(g+1)\log (n),\\
    \text{AIC} &= -2\widehat{l} + 4(g+1)\text{.}
\end{aligned}$$ 

An additional criterion for model selection, namely the
ICL criterion [@biernacki2000] is also implemented in the R package
*clere*. The latter criterion can be written as
$$\text{ICL} = \text{BIC} - \sum^{p}_{j=1}{\sum^{g}_{k=1}{\pi_{jk} \log ( \pi_{jk} ) }}\text{,}$$
where
$\pi_{jk} = \mathbb{E}\left[z_{jk}|\mathbf{y, X};\widehat{\mathbf \theta} \right]$.

## Interpretation of the special group of variables associated with $b_1=0$

The constraint $b_1=0$ is mainly driven by an interpretation purpose.
The meaning of this group depends on both the total number $g$ of groups
and the estimated value of parameter $\gamma^2$. In fact, when $g>1$ and
$\gamma^2$ is small, covariates assigned to that group are likely less
relevant to explain the response. Determining whether $\gamma^2$ is
small enough is not straightforward. However, when this property holds,
we may expect the groups of covariates to be separated. This would for
example translate in the posterior probabilities $\pi_{j1}$ being larger
than 0.7. In addition to the benefit in interpretation, the constraint
$b_1=0$, reduces the number of parameters to be estimated and
consequently the variance of the predictions performed using the model.

# Package functionalities {#sec:package0}

The R package *clere* mainly implements a function for parameter
estimation and model selection: the function `fitClere()`. Four
additional methods are also implemented in the package: for graphical
representation, `plot()`; summarizing the results, `summary()`; for
getting the predicted clusters of variables, `clusters()`; and for
making predictions from new design matrices, `predict()`. Examples of
calls to the functions presented in this section are given in the next
section.

## The main function `fitClere()`

The main function `fitClere()` has only three mandatory arguments: the
vector of response `y` (size $n$), the matrix of explanatory variables
`x` (size $n\times p$) and the number $g$ of groups of regression
coefficients which is expected. The optional parameter `analysis`, when
it takes the value `"aic"`, `"bic"` or `"icl"`, allows to test all the
possible number of groups between $1$ and $g$. The choice between the
two proposed algorithms is possible thanks to the parameter `algorithm`,
but we encourage the users to use the default value, the SEM algorithm,
which generally over-performs the MCEM algorithm (see the first
experiment of the next section).

Several other parameters allow to tune the different numbers of
iterations of the estimation algorithm. In general, the higher are these
parameter values, the better is the quality of the estimation but the
heavier is also the computing time. What we advice is to use the default
values, and to graphically check the quality of the estimation with
plots as in Figure [1](#fig:plot): If the values of the model parameters
are quite stable for a sufficient large part of the iterations, this
indicates that the results are ok. If the stability is not reached
sufficiently early before the end of the iterations, a higher number of
iterations should be chosen.

Finally, among the remaining parameters (note that the complete list can
be obtained with `help("fitClere")`), two are especially important:
`parallel` allows to run parallel computations (if compatible with the
user's computer) and `sparse` allows to impose that one of the
regression parameters is equal to 0 and thus to introduce a cluster of
not significant explanatory variables.

## Methods `summary()`, `plot()`, `clusters()` and `predict()`

The `summary()` method for an object returned by `fitClere()` prints an
overview of the estimated parameters and returns the estimated
likelihood and information based model selection criteria (AIC, BIC and
ICL). The corresponding `plot()` method produces graphs such as ones
presented in Figure [1](#fig:plot).

![Figure 1: []{#fig:plot label="fig:plot"} Values of the model
parameters in view of SEM algorithm iterations. The vertical gray line
in each of the four plots represents the number `nBurn` of iterations
discarded before calculating maximum likelihood
estimates.](images/Figure1.png){#fig:plot width="100%" alt="graphic without alt text"}

The `clusters()` method takes one argument of class "Clere" as returned
by `fitClere()` and a `threshold` argument. This function assigns each
variable to the group where associated conditional probability of
membership is larger than the given `threshold`. [If conditional
probabilities of membership are larger than the specified threshold for
more than one group, then the group having the largest probability is
returned and a warning is printed. If, moreover, there are several ex
aequo on that largest probability, then the group with the smallest
index is returned.]{style="color: black"} When `threshold = NULL`, the
maximum a posteriori (MAP) strategy is used to infer the clusters.

The `predict()` method has two arguments: a "Clere" object and a design
matrix $\mathbf X_{new}$. Using that new design matrix, the `predict()`
method returns an approximation of
$\mathbb{E}\left[\mathbf X_{new}\mathbf \beta|\mathbf y, \mathbf X; \hat{\mathbf
    \theta}\right]$.

# Numerical experiments {#sec:numerical}

This section presents two sets of numerical experiments. The first set
of experiments aims at comparing the MCEM and SEM algorithms in terms of
computational time and estimation or prediction accuracy. The second set
of experiments is aimed at comparing CLERE to standard dimension
reduction techniques. The latter comparison is performed on both
simulated and real data.

## SEM algorithm versus MCEM algorithm {#sec:semvsmcem}

### Description of the simulation study

In this section, a comparison between the SEM algorithm and the MCEM
algorithm is performed. This comparison is performed using the four
following performance indicators:

1.  Computational time (CT) to run a pre-defined number of SEM/MCEM
    iterations. This number was set to 2,000 in this simulation study.

2.  Mean squared estimation error (MSEE) defined as $$\text{MSEE}_a =
          \mathbb{E}\left[(\mathbf{\theta}-\widehat{\mathbf{\theta}}_a)'(\mathbf{\theta}-\widehat{\mathbf{\theta}}_a)\right]\text{,}$$
    where $a\in\left\{\text{\texttt{"SEM","MCEM"}}\right\}$ and
    $\widehat{\mathbf{\theta}}_a$ is an estimated value for parameter
    $\mathbf \theta$ obtained with algorithm $a$. Since $\mathbf \theta$
    is only known up to a permutation of the group labels, we chose the
    permutation leading to the smallest MSEE value.

3.  Mean squared prediction error (MSPE) defined as $$\text{MSPE}_a =
          \mathbb{E}\left[(\mathbf{y^v-X^v\widehat{\theta}_a})'(\mathbf{y^v-X^v\widehat{\theta}_a})\right]\text{,}$$
    where $\mathbf y^v$ and $\mathbf X^v$ are respectively a vector of
    responses and a design matrix from a validation data set.

4.  Maximum log-likelihood (ML) reached. This quantity was approximated
    using 1,000 samples from
    $p(\mathbf Z|\mathbf y;\widehat{\mathbf \theta})$.

Three versions of the MCEM algorithm were proposed for comparison with
the SEM algorithm, depending on the number $M$ (or `nsamp`) of Gibbs
iterations used to approximate the *E step*. That number was varied
between 5, 25 and 125. [We chose these iterations numbers so as to cover
different situations, from a situation in which the number of iterations
is too small to a situation in which that number seems sufficient to
expect having reached convergence of the simulated Markov
chain.]{style="color: black"} Those versions were respectively denoted
MCEM$_5$, MCEM$_{25}$ and MCEM$_{125}$. The comparison was performed
using 200 simulated data sets. [In order to consider high-dimensional
situations with sizes allowing to reproduce multiple simulations in a
reasonable time, ]{style="color: black"}each training data set consisted
of $n=25$ individuals and $p=50$ variables. Validation data sets used to
calculate MSPE consisted of 1,000 individuals each. All covariates were
simulated independently according to the standard Gaussian distribution:
$$\forall(i,j)\text{
    }x_{ij}\sim\mathcal{N}(0,1)\text{.}$$ Both training and validation
data sets were simulated according to model (\@ref(eq:clere0)) using
$\beta_0 = 0$, $\mathbf b = (0,3,15)'$,
$\mathbf \pi = (0.64,0.20,0.16)'$, $\sigma^2=1$ and $\gamma^2=0$. This
is equivalent to simulate data according to the standard linear
regression model defined by: $$y_i \sim
    \mathcal{N}\left(\sum^{32}_{j=1}{0 \times x_{ij}} +
      \sum^{42}_{j=33}{3 \times x_{ij}} + \sum^{50}_{j=43}{15 \times
        x_{ij}},1\right).$$

All algorithms were run using 10 different random starting points.
Estimates yielding the largest likelihood were then used for the
comparison.

### Results of the comparison

Table [1](#tab:simulations) summarizes the results of the comparison
between the algorithms. The MCEM$_{5}$ algorithm was 1.3 times faster
than the SEM algorithm however the latter algorithm poorly performed
regarding all other performance criteria (estimation quality, prediction
error, likelihood maximization). This observation illustrates the
importance of setting a large number $M$ of draws to improve the
estimation. Indeed, when increasing this number to 25 or 125, we
observed an improvement in the estimation accuracy but no noticeable
improvement in the likelihood. In turn, the SEM algorithm was quite
efficient compared to the MCEM$_{25}$ and MCEM$_{125}$ algorithms. This
algorithm not only ran faster (between 3 and 13-fold faster than
MCEM$_{25}$ and MCEM$_{125}$ -- see Table [1](#tab:simulations)), but
also reached predictive performances close to the oracle (i.e., using
the true parameter). These good performances are mainly explained by the
fact that the SEM algorithm most of the time (66.5% of the time) reached
a better likelihood than the other algorithms.

The results of this simulation study were made available as an internal
data set named `algoComp` in the R package *clere*. More details can be
obtained using the command `help("algoComp")`.

## Comparison with other methods {#sec:simulation}

### Description of the methods

In this section, we compare our model to standard dimension reduction
approaches in terms of MSPE. Although a more detailed comparison was
suggested in @yengo2013, we propose here a quick illustration of the
relative predictive performance of our model. The comparison is achieved
using data simulated according to the scenario described above in
Section [SEM algorithm versus MCEM algorithm](#sec:semvsmcem) . The methods selected for comparison are the Ridge regression
[@hoerl1970], the Elastic net [@zou2005], the LASSO [@tibshirani1996],
PACS [@pacs2013], the method of Park and colleagues [@park2007
subsequently denoted AVG] and the Spike and Slab model [@ishwaran2005
subsequently denoted SS]. The first three methods are implemented in the
freely available R package *glmnet*. With the latter package, the tuning
parameter `lambda` was selected using the function `cv.glm` (with 5
folds) aiming at minimizing the mean squared error (option
`type = "mse"`). In particular for the Elastic net, the second tuning
parameter `alpha` (measuring the amount of mixture between the $L^1$ and
$L^2$ penalty) was jointly selected with `lambda` to minimize the mean
squared error. The R package *glmnet* proposes a procedure for
automatically selecting values for `lambda`. We therefore used this
default procedure while we selected `alpha` among
$\{0, 0.1,0.2,\ldots,0.9,1\}$. The PACS methodology proposes to estimate
the regression coefficients by solving a penalized least squares
problem. It imposes a constraint on $\mathbf \beta$ that is a weighted
combination of the $L^1$ norm and the pairwise $L^\infty$ norm.
Upper-bounding the pairwise $L^\infty$ norm enforces the covariates to
have close coefficients. When the constraint is strong enough, closeness
translates into equality achieving thus a grouping property. For PACS,
no software was available. Only an R script was released on Bondell's
web page[^1]. Since this R script was running very slowly, we decided to
reimplement it in C++ and observed a 30-fold speed-up of computational
time. Similarly to Bondell's R script, our implementation uses two
parameters `lambda` and `betawt`. Our reimplementation of Bondell's
script was included in the R package *clere* in the function
`fitPacs()`. In @pacs2013, the authors suggest assigning `betawt` with
the coefficients obtained from a ridge regression model after the tuning
parameter was selected using AIC. In this simulation study we used the
same strategy; however the ridge parameter was selected via 5-fold cross
validation. 5-fold CV was preferred to AIC since selecting the ridge
parameter using AIC always led to estimated coefficients equal to zero.
Once `betawt` was selected, `lambda` was chosen via 5-fold cross
validation among the following values: 0.01, 0.02, 0.05, 0.1, 0.2, 0.5,
1, 2, 5, 10, 20, 50, 100, 200 and 500. All other default parameters of
their script were unchanged. The AVG method is a two-step approach. The
first step uses hierarchical clustering of covariates to create
surrogate covariates by averaging the variables within each group. Those
new predictors are afterwards included in a linear regression model,
replacing the primary variables. A variable selection algorithm is then
applied to select the most predictive groups of covariates. To implement
this method, we followed the algorithm described in @park2007 and
programmed it in R. The Spike and Slab model is a Bayesian approach for
variable selection. It is based on the assumption that the regression
coefficients are distributed according to a mixture of two centered
Gaussian distributions with different variances. One component of the
mixture (the spike) is chosen to have a small variance, while the other
component (the slab) is allowed to have a large variance. Variables
assigned to the spike are dropped from the model. We used the R package
*spikeslab* to run the Spike and Slab models. Especially, we used the
function *spikeslab* from that package to detect influential variables.
The number of iterations used to run the function *spikeslab* was 2,000
(1,000 discarded).

When running `fitClere()`, the number `nItEM` of SEM iterations was set
to 2,000. The number `g` of groups for CLERE was chosen between 1 and 5
using AIC (option `analysis = "aic"`). Two versions of CLERE were
considered: the one with all parameters estimated and the one with $b_1$
set to 0. The latter approach is subsequently denoted CLERE$_0$ (option
`sparse = TRUE`).

### Results of the comparison

Figure [2](#fig:sims) summarizes the comparison between the methods. In
this simulated scenario, CLERE outperformed the other methods in terms
of prediction error. These good performances were improved when
parameter $b_1$ was set to 0. CLERE was also the most parsimonious
approach with an averaged number of estimated parameters equal to 7.7
(6.9 when $b_1=0$). The second best approach was PACS which also led to
parsimonious models. [The superiority of such methods could be expected
since in the simulation model the regression coefficients are gathered
in three groups.]{style="color: black"} Overall variable selection
approaches yielded the largest prediction error in this simulation.
CLERE, PACS and Spike and Slab had the largest computational times (CT).
For CLERE and PACS this loss in CT was compensated by a a strong
improvement in prediction error as explained above, while Spike and Slab
yielded the worst prediction error in addition to being the slowest
approach in this example.

The results of this simulation study were made available as an internal
data set in the R package *clere*. The object is called `numExpSimData`
and more details can be obtained using the command
`help("numExpSimData")`.

## Real data sets analysis {#sec:realdata}

### Description of the data sets

We used in this section the real data sets `Prostate` and `eyedata` from
the R packages [*lasso2*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=lasso2)
[@lasso2] and [*flare*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=flare)
[@flare] respectively. The `Prostate` data set comes from a study that
examined the correlation between the level of prostate specific antigen
and a number of clinical measures in $n=97$ men who were about to
receive a radical prostatectomy. [This data set is a benchmark data set
used in multiple publications about high-dimensional regression model,
including @tibshirani1996 [@Hast:Tibs:Frie:2001], and was chosen here in
order to illustrate the performance of CLERE in comparison to the
competing methods]{style="color: black"}. We used the prostate specific
antigen (variable `lpsa`) as response variable and the $p=8$ other
measurements as covariates.

The `eyedata` data set is extracted from the published study of
@scheetz2006regulation. This data set consists of gene expression levels
measured at $p=200$ probes in $n=120$ rats. The response variable
utilized was the expression of the TRIM32 gene which is a biomarker of
the Bardet-Bidel Syndrome (BBS). We chose this data set to illustrate
the performances of CLERE on a (manageable) high-dimensional problem
which is the actual context for which this method was developped
[@yengo2013].

Those two data sets were utilized to compare CLERE to the same methods
used in the previous section where the simulation study was presented.
All methods were compared in terms of out-of-sample prediction error
estimated using 5-fold cross validation (CV). Those CV statistics were
then averaged and compared across the methods in
Table [2](#tab:realdata).

### Running the analysis

Before presenting the results of the comparison between CLERE and its
competitors, we illustrate the commands to run the analysis of the
`Prostate` data set. The data set is loaded by typing:

``` r
R> data("Prostate", package = "lasso2")
R> y <- Prostate[, "lpsa"]
R> x <- as.matrix(Prostate[, -which(colnames(Prostate) == "lpsa")]) 
```

Possible training (`xt` and `yt`) and validation (`xv` and `yv`) sets
are generated as follows:

``` r
R> itraining <- 1:(0.8*nrow(x))
R> xt <- x[ itraining,]; yt <- y[ itraining]
R> xv <- x[-itraining,]; yv <- y[-itraining]
```

The `fitClere()` function is run using the AIC to select the number of
groups between 1 and 5. To lessen the impact of local minima in the
model selection, 5 random starting points are used. This can be
implemented by:

``` r
R> Seed <- 1234
R> mod  <- fitClere(y = yt, x = xt, g = 5, analysis = "aic", parallel = TRUE, 
+                   nstart = 5, sparse = TRUE, nItEM = 2000, nBurn = 1000, 
+                   nItMC = 10, dp = 5, nsamp = 1000, seed = Seed)

R> plot(mod)
```

Running the command `plot(mod)` generates the plot given in
Figure [1](#fig:plot). We can also access the cluster memberships by
running the command `clusters()`. For example, running the command
`clusters(mod, threshold = 0.7)` yields

``` r
R> clusters(mod, thresold = 0.7)
lcavol lweight     age    lbph     svi     lcp gleason   pgg45 
     2       2       1       1       1       1       1       1 
```

In the example above 2 variables, being the cancer volume (`lcavol`) and
the prostate weight (`lweight`), were assigned to group 2
($b_2=0.4737$). The other 6 variables were assigned to group 1
($b_1=0$). Posterior probabilities of membership are available through
the slot `P` in the object of class "Clere".

``` r
R> mod@P
        Group 1 Group 2
lcavol    0.000   1.000
lweight   0.000   1.000
age       1.000   0.000
lbph      1.000   0.000
svi       0.764   0.236
lcp       1.000   0.000
gleason   1.000   0.000
pgg45     1.000   0.000 
```

The covariates were respectively assigned to their group with a
probability larger than 0.7. Moreover, given that parameter $\gamma^2$
had a very small value ($\widehat{\gamma^2} = 4.065\times10^{-8}$), we
can argue that cancer volume and prostate weight are the only relevant
explanatory covariates. To assess the prediction error associated with
the model we can run the command `predict()` as follows:

``` r
R> error <- mean((yv - predict(mod, xv))^2)
R> error
[1] 1.543122 
```

### Results of the analysis

Table [2](#tab:realdata) summarizes the prediction errors and the number
of parameters obtained for all the methods. CLERE$_0$ had the lowest
prediction error in the analysis of the `Prostate` data set and the
second best performance for the `eyedata` data set. The AVG method was
also very competitive compared to the variable selection approaches
stressing thus the relevance of creating groups of variables to reduce
the dimensionality (especially in the `eyedata` data set). It is worth
noting that in both data sets, imposing the constraint $b_1=0$ improved
the predictive performance of CLERE.

In the `Prostate` data set, CLERE robustly identified two groups of
variables representing influential ($b_2>0)$ and not relevant variables
($b_1=0$). In the `eyedata` data set in turn, AIC led to selecting only
one group of variables. However, this did not lessen the predictive
performance of the model since CLERE$_0$ was second best after AVG,
while needing significantly less parameters. PACS performed badly in
both data sets. The Elastic net showed good predictive performances
compared to the variable selection methods like LASSO or the Spike and
Slab model. Ridge regression and Elastic net had comparable results in
both data sets. In line with the results of the simulation study, we
observed that despite a larger computational time (CT), CLERE and
CLERE$_0$ had a reduced mean squared error compared to the fastest
methods. However, this improvement was less substantial than observed in
the simulation study given the differences in CT. This increased CT may
be explained by the fact that no simple stopping rule is proposed when
fitting CLERE. We may therefore contemplate that a smaller number of SEM
iterations could have been used to yield a similar prediction error.
Indeed, when looking at Figure [1](#fig:plot), we see that convergence
was achieved almost from the first 10 iterations. Still, the observed CT
for CLERE being around 22s for the `eyedata` data set and around 3s for
the `Prostate` data set remains affordable in these examples.

The results of this analysis on real data were made available as an
internal data set named `numExpRealData` in the R package *clere*. Using
the command `help("numExpRealData")` more details can be obtained.

# Conclusions {#sec:conc}

We presented in this paper the R package *clere*. This package
implements two efficient algorithms for fitting the CLusterwise Effect
REgression model: the MCEM and the SEM algorithms. The MCEM algorithm is
to be preferred when $p<n$; the SEM algorithm is more efficient for
high-dimensional data sets ($n<p$). The good performance of SEM over
MCEM could have been expected regarding the computational complexities
of the two algorithms that are
$\mathcal{O}\left( npg + g^3 + N_{max}ng\right)$ and
$\mathcal{O}\left( M(p^2 + pg)\right)$ respectively. In fact, as long as
$p>n$, the SEM algorithm has a lower complexity. However, the
computational time to run our SEM algorithm is more variable compared to
MCEM as its does not have a closed form. We finally advocate the use of
the MCEM algorithm only when $p\ll n$. Another important feature for
model interpretation is proposed by constraining the model parameter
$b_1$ to equal 0, which leads to variable selection. Such a constraint
may also lead to a reduced prediction error. We illustrated on a real
data set, how to run an analysis, based on a detailed R script. Although
our numerical experiments showed that the CLERE method tended to be
slower than variable selection methods, it still provided better or
competitive predictive performance. In addition, the CLERE model was
often more parsimonious than other models and was easily interpretable
since groups of regression coefficients/variables could be summarized
using a single parameter.

Our model can easily be extended to the analysis of binary responses.
This extension will be made available in a forthcoming version of the
package. Another direction for future research will be to develop an
efficient stopping rule for the proposed SEM algorithm, specific to our
context. Such a criterion is expected to improve the computational
performance of our estimation algorithm.
