title: Conditional Fractional Gaussian Fields with the Package FieldSim
abstract: We propose an effective and fast method to simulate multidimensional conditional
  fractional Gaussian fields with the package FieldSim. Our method is valid not only
  for conditional simulations associated to fractional Brownian fields, but to any
  Gaussian field and on any (non regular) grid of points.
