title: 'Generalized Simulated Annealing for Global Optimization: The GenSA Package'
abstract: Many problems in statistics, finance, biology, pharmacology, physics, mathematics,
  eco nomics, and chemistry involve determination of the global minimum of multidimensional
  functions. R packages for different stochastic methods such as genetic algorithms
  and differential evolution have been developed and successfully used in the R community.
  Based on Tsallis statistics, the R package GenSA was developed for generalized simulated
  annealing to process complicated non-linear objective functions with a large number
  of local minima. In this paper we provide a brief introduction to the R package
  and demonstrate its utility by solving a non-convex portfolio optimization problem
  in finance and the Thomson problem in physics. GenSA is useful and can serve as
  a complementary tool to, rather than a replacement for, other widely used R packages
  for optimization.
