title: 'riskRegression: Predicting the Risk of an Event using Cox Regression Models'
abstract: In the presence of competing risks a prediction of the time-dynamic absolute
  risk of an event can be based on cause-specific Cox regression models for the event
  and the competing risks (Benichou and Gail, 1990). We present computationally fast
  and memory optimized C++ functions with an R inter face for predicting the covariate
  specific absolute risks, their confidence intervals, and their confidence bands
  based on right censored time to event data. We provide explicit formulas for our
  implementation of the estimator of the (stratified) baseline hazard function in
  the presence of tied event times. As a by-product we obtain fast access to the baseline
  hazards (compared to survival::basehaz()) and predictions of survival probabilities,
  their confidence intervals and confidence bands. Confidence intervals and confidence
  bands are based on point-wise asymptotic expansions of the corresponding statistical
  functionals. The software presented here is implemented in the riskRegression package.
