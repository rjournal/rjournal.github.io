title: 'GrpString: An R Package for Analysis of Groups of Strings'
abstract: The R package GrpString was developed as a comprehensive toolkit for quantitatively
  analyzing and comparing groups of strings. It offers functions for researchers and
  data analysts to prepare strings from event sequences, extract common patterns from
  strings, and compare patterns be tween string vectors. The package also finds transition
  matrices and complexity of strings, determines clusters in a string vector, and
  examines the statistical difference between two groups of strings.
