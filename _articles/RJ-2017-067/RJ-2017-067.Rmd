title: 'RQGIS: Integrating R with QGIS for Statistical Geocomputing'
abstract: Integrating R with Geographic Information Systems (GIS) extends Râ€™s statistical
  capabilities with numerous geoprocessing and data handling tools available in a
  GIS. QGIS is one of the most popular open-source GIS, and it furthermore integrates
  other GIS programs such as the System for Automated Geoscientific Analyses (SAGA)
  GIS and the Geographic Resources Analysis Support System (GRASS) GIS within a single
  software environment. This and its QGIS Python API makes it a perfect candidate
  for console-based geoprocessing. By establishing an interface, the R package RQGIS
  makes it possible to use QGIS as a geoprocessing workhorse from within R. Compared
  to other packages building a bridge to GIS (e.g., rgrass7, RSAGA, RPyGeo), RQGIS
  offers a wider range of geoalgorithms, and is often easier to use due to various
  convenience functions. Finally, RQGIS supports the seamless integration of Python
  code using reticulate from within R for improved extendability.
