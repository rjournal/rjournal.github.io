title: 'fanplot: An R Package for Visualising Sequential Distributions'
abstract: Fan charts, first developed by the Bank of England in 1996, have become
  a standard method for visualising forecasts with uncertainty. Using shading fan
  charts focus the attention towards the whole distribution away from a single central
  measure. This article describes the basics of plotting fan charts using an R add-on
  package alongside some additional methods for displaying sequential distributions.
  Examples are based on distributions of both estimated parameters from a time series
  model and future values with uncertainty.

# Introduction

Probabilities are notoriously difficult to communicate effectively to
lay audiences [@Spiegelhalter2011]. Fan charts provide one such method
to illustrate either forecasts or past results that are based on
probabilistic distributions. Using shading fan charts focus the
attention of the reader on the whole distribution away from a single
central estimate. Visualising the distribution can aid in communicating
the degree of underlying uncertainty in probabilistic forecasts to
non-specialists, that might not have been apparent in basic plots and
summary statistics.

Fan charts were first introduced by the Bank of England for their
inflation forecasts in February 1996 [@Britton1998]. Since their initial
development fan charts have become a standard method to display
uncertainty of future economic indicators by many central banks
[@Julio2007]. Their use has also spread to other fields such as climate
science [@McShane2011] and demography [@Gerland2014a].

Fan charts can be created using various software. Within R, the
[*vars*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=vars) package [@Pfaff2008]
has a `fanchart` function for forecasts of confidence regions. It is
based solely on "varpred" class objects, i.e., on the predictions of
Vector Autoregressive models fitted using other functions within the
*vars* package. Similarly, the
[*forecast*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=forecast) package
[@Hyndman2008b] produces fan charts for forecasts based on time series
models from the "forecast" class. [@Julio2009] provides VBA code in
order to plot fan charts for quarterly GDP data in Excel. Alternatively
one could use point and click methods in Excel to build customised fan
charts based on stacked area charts.[^1] [@Buchmann2010] provides MATLAB
code to create fan charts for user supplied forecast distributions with
a limited amount of control for the plotted display.

In any of the fore-mentioned options users are restricted in either
their ability to effectively adapt the properties of fan charts or
create plots based on alternative models, values or simulated data. The
aim of this article is to illustrate R code in the
[*fanplot*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=fanplot) package to
create fan charts of different styles and from a range of input data.
These are demonstrated on data from sequential Monte Carlo Markov chain
(MCMC) simulated distributions of parameters in a stochastic volatility
model and expert based forecasts for the Consumer Price Index (CPI) of
the Bank of England.

# Fan charts for sequential simulated distributions

The *fanplot* package can used to display any form of sequential
distributions along a plots x-axis. To illustrate, we use posterior
density distributions of the estimated volatility of daily returns
($y_t$) from the Pound/Dollar exchange rate from 02/10/1981 to
28/6/1985. As @meyer2002bugs show, posterior distributions for the
volatility process can be estimated in WinBUGS by fitting the stochastic
volatility model;
$$y_t | \theta_t = \exp\left(\frac{1}{2}\theta_t\right)u_t \qquad u_t \sim N(0, 1)  \qquad t=1,\ldots,n.$$
The latent volatilities $\theta_t$, which are unknown states in a
state-space model terminology [@Harvey1990], are assumed to follow a
Markovian transition over time given by the state equations:
$$\theta_t | \theta_{t-1}, \mu, \phi, \tau^2 = \mu + \phi \log \sigma^2_{t-1} + v_t  \qquad v_t \sim N(0, \tau^2)  \qquad t=1,\ldots,n$$
with $\theta_0 \sim N(\mu, \tau^2)$.

A sample of the posterior distributions of $\theta_t$ is contained in
the `th.mcmc` object of the *fanplot* package. It consists of (1000)
rows corresponding to MCMC simulations and (945) columns corresponding
to time points $t$. Example code to replicate this object using
[*R2OpenBUGS*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=R2OpenBUGS)
[@sturtz2005r2b] is given in the help file for the `th.mcmc` object. It
is based on the BUGS model of @meyer2002bugs replicated in the `my1.R`
file of the *fanplot* package. Time ordered simulated distributions,
such as `th.mcmc`, can be easily extracted from the `sims.list` element
of an *R2OpenBUGS* "bugs" object.

A fan chart of the evolution of the distribution of $\theta_t$ in
Figure [1](#fig:sv1) can be plotted using either the `fan0` or `fan`
function. The `fan0` function, which we will first discuss, provides the
simplest representation;

``` r
library("fanplot")
fan0(data = th.mcmc) 
```

![Figure 1: Stochastic Volatility Fan Chart for the Pound-Dollar
Exchange Rate Data.](sv1.png){#fig:sv1 width="100%" alt="graphic without alt text"}

The plotting function calculates the values of 100 equally spaced
percentiles of each future distribution when the default
`data.type = "simulations"` is set. This allows 50 fans to be plotted
from the `heat.colours` colour palette, providing darker shadings for
the more probable percentiles. The axis limits are determined from the
`data` argument. By default, the y-axis limits to 85 percent of the
range of the MCMC distributions to reduce white space in the plot.

Similar plots of sequential distributions from alternative Bayesian
models can be easily plotted using the `fan0` or `fan` functions. The
`data` argument accepts objects from a range of classes including "mcmc"
which is typically used to handle BUGS or JAGS results via the
`read.coda` or `read.jags` commands.

The data in `th.mcmc` are based on trading day observations only.
Irregular time series can be handled by passing a
[*zoo*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=zoo) time series object
[@Zeileis2005] to the data argument. The trading days are given in the
`spvdx` object of the
[*tsbugs*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=tsbugs) package
[@Abel2013c].

``` r
library("zoo")
library("tsbugs")

# create irregular multiple time series object
th.mcmc2 <- zoo(th.mcmc, order.by = svpdx$date)                                                                      #$

# plot
fan0(data = th.mcmc2, type = "interval", ln = c(0.5, 0.8, 0.95), 
     llab = TRUE, rcex = 0.6)
```

![Figure 2: Stochastic Volatility Fan Chart for the Pound-Dollar
Exchange Rate Data with Prediction Intervals.](sv2.png){#fig:sv2
width="100%" alt="graphic without alt text"}

Basing the fan chart on a *zoo* time series allows the x-axis in
Figure [2](#fig:sv2) to use the corresponding trading days rather than
the observations index as in Figure [1](#fig:sv1). When argument
`type = "interval"` is set, the `probs` argument corresponds to
prediction intervals. Consequently, the default interval fan chart
comprises of three different shades, running from the darkest for the
50th prediction interval to the lightest for the 95th prediction
interval. Contour lines are are controlled by the `ln` argument, which
is set to `NULL` by default for `fan0`. In Figure [2](#fig:sv2), changes
in the default of `ln` overlays lines on the fan chart for the upper and
lower bounds of the 50th, 80th and 95th prediction intervals. A further
line is plotted along the median of $\theta_t$ controlled by the
`med.ln` argument and shown when `type = "interval"`. Labels on the
right hand side are by default added to correspond to the upper and
lower bounds of each plotted line. The text size of the labels are
controlled by the `rcex` argument. This is set to 0.6 to incorporate the
labels without extending the limits of the x-axis. The left labels are
added by setting `llab = TRUE` and take the same text properties as the
right labels. Users can customize many properties of the fan chart
shading, labels contour lines, labels and axis through a range of
arguments.

Spaghetti plots are a method of viewing data to visualize possible
values through a systems. They are commonly used on geographical data,
such as meteorological forecasts [@Sanyal2010] to show possible or
realised paths, or over time, such in longitudinal data analysis
[@Hedeker2006]. Spaghetti plots can also be used represent uncertainty
shown by a range of possible future trajectories or past estimates. For
example, using the `th.mcmc2` object Figure [3](#fig:sv3) displays 20
random sets of $\theta_t$ simulations plotted by setting the argument
`style = "spaghetti"`;

``` r
# transparent fan with visible lines
fan0(th.mcmc2, ln = c(5, 20, 50, 80, 95), alpha = 0, ln.col = "darkorange", llab = TRUE)

# spaghetti lines
fan(th.mcmc2, style = "spaghetti", n.spag = 20, alpha = 0.3)
```

![Figure 3: Stochastic Volatility Spaghetti Plot for the Pound-Dollar
Exchange Rate Data.](sv3.png){#fig:sv3 width="100%" alt="graphic without alt text"}

The initial fan chart is completely transparent from setting the
transparency argument `alpha = 0`. In order for the percentile lines to
be visible a non-transparent colour is used for the `ln.col` argument.
Lines are plotted according the user defined `ln` argument to provide
underlying uncertainty measures for the posterior probability
distribution. The spaghetti lines, which are semi-transparent, are based
on a random selection of simulations. They are superimposed on a fan
chart using the `fan` function, which operates in much the similar way
as `fan0`. The most important difference between the two is in the
default setting of the `add` argument, which controls whether to create
a new plot window for a fan chart or add it to an existing device. For
the `fan` function, `add` is set to `TRUE` and hence its is more
appropriately used to add a fan chart to an existing plotting device.
The `fan` function also adds lines and labels on select contours by
default as illustrated in the next section.

# Bank of England fan charts {#sec:boe}

The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) of the Bank of England produces fan
charts of forecasts for Consumer Price Index (CPI) of inflation and
Gross Domestic Product in their quarterly Inflation Reports. Alongside
the fan charts, the Bank of England provides data, in the form of
central location, uncertainty and skewness parameters of a split-normal
distribution that underlie their fan charts.[^2] The probability density
of the split-normal distribution is given by @Julio2007[^3] as,

$$f(x; \mu, \sigma_1, \sigma_2) = \left\{ 
\begin{array}{ll}
 \frac{\sqrt 2}{\sqrt\pi (\sigma_1+\sigma_2)} e^{-\frac{1}{2\sigma_1^2}(x-\mu)^2} & \mbox{for } -\infty < x \leq \mu \\
 \frac{\sqrt 2}{\sqrt\pi (\sigma_1+\sigma_2)} e^{-\frac{1}{2\sigma_2^2}(x-\mu)^2} & \mbox{for } \mu < x < \infty \\
 \end{array},
\right.$$

where $\mu$ represents the mode, and the two standard deviations
$\sigma_1$ and $\sigma_2$ can be derived given the overall uncertainty
parameter, $\sigma$ and skewness parameters, $\gamma$, as;

$$\sigma^2=\sigma^2_1(1+\gamma)=\sigma^2_2(1-\gamma).$$

Functions for the probability density, cumulative distribution,
quantiles and random generation for the split-normal distribution can be
found in the *fanplot* package.

The `boe` data frame provides historical details on the forecasts of the
MPC for CPI inflation between Q1 2004 to Q4 2013.

``` r
> head(boe)
  time0    time mode uncertainty skew
1  2004 2004.00 1.34      0.2249    0
2  2004 2004.25 1.60      0.3149    0
3  2004 2004.50 1.60      0.3824    0
4  2004 2004.75 1.71      0.4274    0
5  2004 2005.00 1.77      0.4499    0
6  2004 2005.25 1.68      0.4761    0
```

The first column `time0` refers to the base year of forecast, the
second, `time` indexes future projections, whilst the remaining three
columns provide values for the corresponding projected central location
($\mu$), uncertainty ($\sigma$) and skew ($\gamma$) parameters:

Bank of England style fan charts vary from quarter to quarter but follow
a similar theme throughout, which can be replicated in R using the
*fanplot* package. The input data given to a `fan` function to plot a
fan chart differs from the simulations of the previous section. Rather
than many simulations from distributions in each time period we can pass
a "matrix" object of time ordered values from the split-normal quantile
function.[^4] As is the case for passing simulated values to the `fan`
function, rows of the data object represent a set of user defined
probabilities and columns represent a set of time points. For example,
in the code below, a subset of the Bank of England future parameters of
CPI published in Q1 2013 are first selected. Then a vector of
probabilities related to the percentiles, that we ultimately would like
to plot different shaded fans for, are created. Finally, in a `for`
loop, the `qsplitnorm` function calculates the values for which the
time-specific (`i`) split-normal distribution will be less than or equal
to the probabilities of `p`.

``` r
# select relevant data
y0 <- 2013
boe0 <- subset(boe, time0 == y0)
k <- nrow(boe0)
 
# guess work to set percentiles the boe are plotting
p <- seq(0.05, 0.95, 0.05)
p <- c(0.01, p, 0.99)
  
# quantiles of split-normal distribution for each probability (row) at each future
# time point (column)
cpival <- matrix(NA, nrow = length(p), ncol = k)
for (i in 1:k)
   cpival[, i] <- qsplitnorm(p, mode = boe0$mode[i],
                             sd = boe0$uncertainty[i],
                             skew = boe0$skew[i])                                                          #$
```

The new object `cpival` contains values evaluated from the `qsplitnorm`
function in 6 rows, for our selected probabilities used in the
calculation `p`, and 13 columns for successive time periods for which
the MPC provide future parameters.

The `cpival` object can be used to add a fan chart to an active R
graphic device. In the code below, the area of Figure [4](#fig:boe1) is
set up when plotting the past CPI data, contained in the time series
object `cpi`. The `xlim` arguments are set to ensure space on the right
hand side of the plotting area for the fan. Following as closely as
possible the Bank of England style for plotting fan charts for Q1
2013[^5], the plotting area is set to near square, the background for
future values is a gray colour, y-axis are plotted on the right hand
side, a horizontal line are added for the CPI target and a vertical line
for the two-year ahead point.

``` r
# past data
plot(cpi, type = "l", col = "tomato", lwd = 2, 
     xlim = c(y0 - 5, y0 + 3), ylim = c(-2, 7), 
     xaxt = "n", yaxt = "n", ylab = "")

# background shading during forecast period
rect(y0 - 0.25, par("usr")[3] - 1, y0 + 3, par("usr")[4] + 1, 
     border = "gray90", col = "gray90")

# add fan
fan(data = cpival, data.type = "values", probs = p, 
    start = y0, frequency = 4, anchor = cpi[time(cpi) == y0 - 0.25], 
    fan.col = colorRampPalette(c("tomato", "gray90")), ln = NULL, rlab = NULL)

# boe aesthetics
axis(2, at = -2:7, las = 2, tcl = 0.5, labels = FALSE)
axis(4, at = -2:7, las = 2, tcl = 0.5)
axis(1, at = 2008:2016, tcl = 0.5)
axis(1, at = seq(2008, 2016, 0.25), labels = FALSE, tcl = 0.2)
abline(h = 2)                   # boe cpi target
abline(v = y0 + 1.75, lty = 2)  # 2 year line
```

![Figure 4: Fan chart, in the Bank of England style, for the MPC Q1 2013
forecast of the percentage increase in prices on year
earlier.](boe1.png){#fig:boe1 width="100%" alt="graphic without alt text"}

The fan chart itself is outputted from the `fan` function, where
arguments are set to ensure a close resemblance of the R plot to that
produced by the Bank of England. The first three arguments in the `fan`
function called in the above code, provide the `cpival` data to be
plotted, indicate that the data are a set of calculated values (as
opposed to simulations as in the previous examples) and provide the
probabilities that correspond to each row of `cpival` object. The next
two arguments define the start time and frequency of the data. These
operate in a similar fashion to those used when defining time series in
R with the `ts` function. The `anchor` argument is set to the value of
CPI before the start of the fan chart. This allows a join between the
value of the Q1 2013 observation and the fan chart. The `fan.col`
argument is set to a colour palette for shades between `tomato` and
`gray90`. The final two arguments are set to `NULL` to suppress the
plotting of contour lines at the boundary of each shaded fan and their
labels, as per the Bank of England style.

An alternative plot in Figure [5](#fig:boe2) is based on a regular time
series object of simulated data and some other style settings in the
`fan` function. These produce a fan chart with a greater array of
coloured fans with labels and contour lines alongside selected
percentiles of the future distribution. The input data is based upon
10,000 simulated values produced using the `rsplitnorm` function and the
future split-normal distribution parameters from Q1 2013 in the
truncated `boe0` data frame;

``` r
# simulate future values
cpisim <- matrix(NA, nrow = 10000, ncol = k)
for (i in 1:k)
  cpisim[, i] <- rsplitnorm(n = 10000, mode = boe0$mode[i],
                            sd = boe0$uncertainty[i],
                            skew = boe0$skew[i])  
```

The fan chart based on the simulations in `cpisim` are then be added to
the truncated CPI data plot;

``` r
# truncate cpi series and plot
cpi0 <- ts(cpi[time(cpi) < 2013], start = start(cpi), frequency = frequency(cpi))
plot(cpi0, type = "l", lwd = 2, las = 1, ylab = "",
     xlim = c(y0 - 5, y0 + 3.5), ylim = c(-2, 7))

# add fan
library("RColorBrewer")
fan(data = cpisim, type = "interval", probs = seq(0.01,0.99,0.01), 
    start = y0, frequency = 4, ln = c(50,80,95), med.ln = FALSE, 
    fan.col = colorRampPalette(colors = rev(brewer.pal(9, "Oranges"))))
```

![Figure 5: Alternative fan chart for the MPC Q1 2013 CPI
forecast.](boe2.png){#fig:boe2 width="100%" alt="graphic without alt text"}

This code shows how users can control multiple visual elements of the
fan chart, not previously illustrated. In Figure [5](#fig:boe2) the fan
is based on 50 shadings for 100 equally spaced percentiles of the future
distributions specified through the `probs` argument. The colour scheme
is based on the `Oranges` palette from the
[*RColorBrewer*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=RColorBrewer)
package [@Neuwirth2014]. Contour lines for the upper and lower intervals
of the 50th, 80th and 95th prediction intervals are imposed using the
`ln` argument. The median line, plotted by default when
`type = "interval"` is set, is removed using the `med.ln` argument.

Box plots [@Tukey1977] are commonly used as a simple descriptive
statistics to visualise data through their quartiles. The `boxplot`
function in R has many options including the display of multiple box
plots based on sequential distributions. However, when data is based on
a time series with multiple observations during a unit of time, such as
quarterly data, fixing the location of the plot on the x-axis can be
cumbersome. The `fan` function overcomes this problem when setting
`style = "boxplot"`. In Figure [6](#fig:boe3) the simulated future CPI
data `cpisim` are passed to the `data` argument:

``` r
# plot past data
plot(cpi0, type = "l", xlim = c(y0-5, y0+3), ylim = c(-2, 7), lwd = 2)

# box plots
fan(cpisim, style = "boxplot", start = y0, frequency = 4, outline = FALSE)
```

![Figure 6: Box plots for the MPC Q1 2013 CPI
forecast.](boe3.png){#fig:boe3 width="100%" alt="graphic without alt text"}

The `fan` function allows users to easily the locate sequential
distributions of box plots on the x-axis using the `start` and
`frequency` arguments. Additional arguments in the `fan` function are
passed to `boxplot`. For example from the code above, outliers are
suppressed by setting `outline = FALSE`.

# Summary

The *fanplot* package allows users to easily visualise uncertainty based
on either simulations from sequential distributions or values based on
pre-calculated quartiles of distribution. Interactive visualisations of
fan charts, as demonstrated in the `net_elicit.R` demo using the
[*shiny*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=shiny) package
[@RStudio2014], could potentially allow for an intuitive elicitation of
experts forecasts[^6]. Data of various classes can be incorporated
including regular time series ("mts"), irregular time series ("zoo") and
simulations from, say, MCMC via "matrix", "data.frame" or "mcmc" type
objects. The fanplot package also has a range of options to adjust
colour shadings of fan charts, their lines and labels, and specify
whether to display prediction intervals or percentiles of
distributions.[^7]
