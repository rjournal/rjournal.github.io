title: 'fanplot: An R Package for Visualising Sequential Distributions'
abstract: Fan charts, first developed by the Bank of England in 1996, have become
  a standard method for visualising forecasts with uncertainty. Using shading fan
  charts focus the attention towards the whole distribution away from a single central
  measure. This article describes the basics of plotting fan charts using an R add-on
  package alongside some additional methods for displaying sequential distributions.
  Examples are based on distributions of both estimated parameters from a time series
  model and future values with uncertainty.
