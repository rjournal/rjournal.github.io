title: Finding Optimal Normalizing Transformations via bestNormalize
abstract: The bestNormalize R package was designed to help users find a transformation
  that can effectively normalize a vector regardless of its actual distribution. Each
  of the many normalization techniques that have been developed has its own strengths
  and weaknesses, and deciding which to use until data are fully observed is difficult
  or impossible. This package facilitates choosing between a range of possible transformations
  and will automatically return the best one, i.e., the one that makes data look the
  *most* normal. To evaluate and compare the normalization efficacy across a suite
  of possible transformations, we developed a statistic based on a goodness of fit
  test divided by its degrees of freedom. Transformations can be seamlessly trained
  and applied to newly observed data and can be implemented in conjunction with caret
  and recipes for data preprocessing in machine learning workflows. Custom transformations
  and normalization statistics are supported.
