title: 'keyplayer: An R Package for Locating Key Players in Social Networks'
abstract: Interest in social network analysis has exploded in the past few years,
  partly thanks to the advancements in statistical methods and computing for network
  analysis. A wide range of the methods for network analysis is already covered by
  existent R packages. However, no comprehensive packages are available to calculate
  group centrality scores and to identify key players (i.e., those players who constitute
  the most central group) in a network. These functionalities are important because,
  for example, many social and health interventions rely on key players to facilitate
  the intervention. Identifying key players is challenging because players who are
  individually the most central are not necessarily the most central as a group due
  to redundancy in their connections. In this paper we develop methods and tools for
  computing group centrality scores and for identifying key players in social networks.
  We illustrate the methods using both simulated and empirical examples. The package
  keyplayer providing the presented methods is available from Comprehensive R Archive
  Network (CRAN).
