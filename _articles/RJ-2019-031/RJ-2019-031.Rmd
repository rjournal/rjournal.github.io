title: 'swgee: An R Package for Analyzing Longitudinal Data with Response Missingness
  and Covariate Measurement Error'
abstract: Though longitudinal data often contain missing responses and error-prone
  covariates, relatively little work has been available to simultaneously correct
  for the effects of response missingness and covariate measurement error on analysis
  of longitudinal data. Yi (2008) proposed a simulation based marginal method to adjust
  for the bias induced by measurement error in covariates as well as by missingness
  in response. The proposed method focuses on modeling the marginal mean and variance
  structures, and the missing at random mechanism is assumed. Furthermore, the distribution
  of covariates are left unspecified. These features make the proposed method applicable
  to a broad settings. In this paper, we develop an R package, called swgee, which
  implements the method proposed by Yi (2008). Moreover, our package includes additional
  implementation steps which extend the setting considered by Yi (2008). To describe
  the use of the package and its main features, we report simulation studies and analyses
  of a data set arising from the Framingham Heart Study.
