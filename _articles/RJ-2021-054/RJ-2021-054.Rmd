title: 'Regularized Transformation Models: The tramnet Package'
abstract: ' The [tramnet](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=tramnet) package implements
  regularized linear transformation models by combining the flexible class of transformation
  models from [tram](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=tram) with constrained convex
  optimization implemented in [CVXR](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=CVXR). Regularized
  transformation models unify many existing and novel regularized regression models
  under one theoretical and computational framework. Regularization strategies implemented
  for transformation models in tramnet include the Lasso, ridge regression, and the
  elastic net and follow the parameterization in [glmnet](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=glmnet).
  Several functionalities for optimizing the hyperparameters, including model-based
  optimization based on the [mlrMBO](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=mlrMBO) package,
  are implemented. A multitude of S3 methods is deployed for visualization, handling,
  and simulation purposes. This work aims at illustrating all facets of tramnet in
  realistic settings and comparing regularized transformation models with existing
  implementations of similar models. '
