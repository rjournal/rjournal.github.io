# Introduction

A plethora of [R]{.sans-serif} packages exists to estimate generalized
linear regression models via penalized maximum likelihood, such as
[penalized](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=penalized)
[@penalizedpaper] and glmnet [@glmnetpaper]. Both packages come with an
extension to fit a penalized form of the Cox proportional hazard model.
The tramnet package aims at unifying the above-mentioned and several
novel models using the theoretical and computational framework of
transformation models. Novel models in this class include Continuous
Outcome Logistic Regression (COLR), as introduced by @COLRpaper and
Box-Cox type regression models with a transformed conditionally normal
response [@boxcox; @pkg:tram].

The disciplined convex optimization package CVXR [@CVXRpaper] is applied
to solve the constrained convex optimization problems that arise when
fitting regularized transformation models. Transformation models are
introduced in Section . For a more theoretical treatise, we refer to
@ctmpaper [@mltpaper; @mltjss]. Convex optimization and domain-specific
languages are briefly discussed in Section , followed by a treatment of
model-based optimization for hyperparameter tuning (Section ).

## Transformation models {#subsec:tram}

In stark contrast to penalized generalized linear models, regularized
transformation models aim at estimating the response's whole conditional
distribution instead of focusing on a single moment, *e.g.*, the
conditional mean. This conditional distribution function of a response
$Y$ is decomposed into an *a priori* chosen absolute continuous and
log-concave error distribution $F$ and a conditional transformation
function $h(y\rvert\text{\boldmath$x$}, \text{\boldmath$s$})$ that
depends on the measured covariates $\text{\boldmath$x$}$ and stratum
variables $\text{\boldmath$s$}$ and is monotone increasing in $y$.
Although the model class is more flexible, packages tram and tramnet
focus on stratified linear transformation models of the form

$$\begin{aligned}
 \label{fm:trafo}
	\mathbb{P}\left(Y\le y\rvert\text{\boldmath$X$}= \text{\boldmath$x$}, \text{\boldmath$S$}= \text{\boldmath$s$}\right) =
	F\left(h(y\rvert\text{\boldmath$s$}, \text{\boldmath$x$})\right) = F\left(h(y\rvert\text{\boldmath$s$}) -
	\text{\boldmath$x$}^\top\text{\boldmath$\beta$}\right).\end{aligned}$$
Here, the baseline transformation is allowed to vary with stratum
variables $\text{\boldmath$s$}$, while covariate effects
$\text{\boldmath$\beta$}$ are restricted to be shifts common to all
baseline transformations $h(y\rvert\text{\boldmath$s$})$.

In order for the model to represent a valid cumulative distribution
function,
$F\left(h(y\rvert\text{\boldmath$s$}, \text{\boldmath$x$})\right)$ has
to be monotone increasing in $y$, and thus, in $h$ for all possible
strata $\text{\boldmath$s$}$ and all possible configurations of the
covariates $\text{\boldmath$x$}$. To ensure monotonicity, $h$ is
parameterized in terms of a basis expansion using Bernstein polynomials
as implemented in the
[basefun](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=basefun) package [@mltjss].
Hence, $h$ is of the form

$$\begin{aligned}
	h(y) = \text{\boldmath$a$}_{\text{Bs},p}(y)^\top \text{\boldmath$\vartheta$},\end{aligned}$$
where $\text{\boldmath$a$}_{\text{Bs},p}(y)$ denotes the vector of basis
functions in $y$ of order $p$ and $\text{\boldmath$\vartheta$}$ are the
coefficients for each basis function. Conveniently,
$\text{\boldmath$a$}_{\text{Bs},p}(y)^\top \text{\boldmath$\vartheta$}$
is monotone increasing in $y$ as long as

$$\begin{aligned}
 \label{eq:const}
\begin{array}{ll}
\vartheta_i \leq \vartheta_{i+1}, & i = 0, \dots, p - 1
\end{array}\end{aligned}$$ holds. For the concrete parameterization of
stratified linear transformation models, the reader is referred to
@pkg:tram.

Many contemporary models can be understood as linear transformation
models, such as the normal linear regression model, logistic regression
for binary, ordered, and continuous responses, as well as exponential,
Weibull and Rayleigh regression, and the Cox model in survival analysis.
Thus, by appropriately choosing and parameterizing $F$ and $h$, one can
understand all those models in the same maximum likelihood-based
framework. One can formulate the corresponding likelihood contributions
not only for exact observations but under any form of random censoring
and truncation for continuous and count or ordered categorical
responses.

Given a univariate response $Y$ and a set of covariates
$\text{\boldmath$X$}= \text{\boldmath$x$}$ and strata
$\text{\boldmath$S$}= \text{\boldmath$s$}$, one can specify the
following cumulative distribution function and density valid for any
linear transformation model:

$$\begin{aligned}
  \begin{aligned}
  	F_{Y| \text{\boldmath$X$}= \text{\boldmath$x$}}(y\rvert\text{\boldmath$s$}, \text{\boldmath$x$}) &= F\left(h(y\mid \text{\boldmath$s$}) - \text{\boldmath$x$}^\top \text{\boldmath$\beta$}\right), \\
  	f_{Y| \text{\boldmath$X$}= \text{\boldmath$x$}}(y\rvert\text{\boldmath$s$}, \text{\boldmath$x$}) &= F'\left(h(y\mid \text{\boldmath$s$}) - \text{\boldmath$x$}^\top \text{\boldmath$\beta$}\right)
  	\cdot h'(y\mid \text{\boldmath$s$}).
  \end{aligned}\end{aligned}$$ From here, the log-likelihood
contributions for exact, right, left, and interval-censored responses
can be derived as

$$\begin{aligned}
  \begin{aligned}
  	\ell(\text{\boldmath$\vartheta$},\text{\boldmath$\beta$};y_i, \text{\boldmath$s$}_i, \text{\boldmath$x$}_i) &=
  	\left\{
  	\begin{array}{lll}
  	  \log\left(F'\left(h\left(y_i \mid \text{\boldmath$s$}_i \right) - \text{\boldmath$x$}_i^\top \text{\boldmath$\beta$}
  	  \right)\right) + \log\left(h'(y_i \mid \text{\boldmath$s$}_i)\right) & y_i & \text{exact}\\
  	  \log\left(F\left(h(\bar{y} \mid \text{\boldmath$s$}_i) - \text{\boldmath$x$}_i^\top \text{\boldmath$\beta$}\right)
  	  \right) & y_i  \in (-\infty, \bar{y}] & \text{left} \\
  	   \log\left(1 -
  	  F\left(h(\underaccent{\bar}{y} \mid \text{\boldmath$s$}_i) - \text{\boldmath$x$}_i^\top \text{\boldmath$\beta$}\right)\right) &
  	  y_i \in (\underaccent{\bar}{y}, \infty) & \text{right} \\
  	  \log\left(F\left(h(\bar{y} \mid \text{\boldmath$s$}_i) - \text{\boldmath$x$}_i^\top \text{\boldmath$\beta$}\right) -
  	  F\left(h(\underaccent{\bar}{y} \mid \text{\boldmath$s$}_i) - \text{\boldmath$x$}_i^\top \text{\boldmath$\beta$}\right)\right) &
  	  y_i \in (\underaccent{\bar}{y}, \bar{y}] & \text{interval}.  \\
  	\end{array}
  	\right.
  \end{aligned}\end{aligned}$$ The joint log-likelihood of several
observations
$\{(y_i, \text{\boldmath$x$}_i, \text{\boldmath$s$}_i)\}_{i=1}^n$ is
obtained by summing over the individual log-likelihood contributions
$\ell_i$ under the assumption that the individual samples are
independent and identically distributed, the case exclusively dealt with
by tramnet.

## Regularization {#regul}

The aim of tramnet is to enable the estimation of regularized stratified
linear transformation models. This is achieved by optimizing a penalized
form of the log-likelihood introduced in the last section. The penalized
log-likelihood,

$$\begin{aligned}
  \tilde\ell(\text{\boldmath$\vartheta$},\text{\boldmath$\beta$},\lambda,\alpha;y, \text{\boldmath$s$}, \text{\boldmath$x$})= \ell(\text{\boldmath$\vartheta$},\text{\boldmath$\beta$};y, \text{\boldmath$s$}, \text{\boldmath$x$})- \lambda\left(\alpha \left\lVert\text{\boldmath$\beta$}\right\rVert_1 + \frac{1}{2}
    (1-\alpha) \left\lVert\text{\boldmath$\beta$}\right\rVert_2^2 \right),\end{aligned}$$
consists of the unpenalized log-likelihood and an additional penalty
term. Note that only the shift parameters $\text{\boldmath$\beta$}$ are
penalized, whereas the coefficients for the baseline transformation
$\text{\boldmath$\vartheta$}$ remain unpenalized. The parameterization
of the penalty is chosen to be the same as in glmnet, consisting of a
global penalization parameter $\lambda$, and a mixing parameter $\alpha$
controlling the amount of $L_1$ compared to $L_2$ penalization.

The two penalties and any combination thereof have unique properties and
may be useful under different circumstances. A pure $L_1$ penalty was
first introduced by @lasso1996 in an OLS framework and was dubbed the
Lasso (Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator) due to its
property of shrinking regression coefficients exactly to 0 for large
enough $\lambda$. A pure Lasso penalty can be obtained in a regularized
transformation model by specifying $\alpha = 1$. Applying an $L_2$
penalty in an OLS problem was introduced more than five decades earlier
by @tikhonov1943stability and later termed ridge regression
[@hoerl1970ridge]. In contrast to Lasso, ridge regression leads to
shrunken regression coefficients but does not perform automatic variable
selection. @zou2005regularization picked up on both approaches,
discussed their advantages, disadvantages, and overall characteristics
and combined them into the elastic net penalty, a convex combination of
an $L_1$ and $L_2$ penalty controlled by the mixing parameter $\alpha$.
Some of these properties will be illustrated for different models and a
real-world data set in Sections  and .

## Constrained convex optimization {#subsec:CVXR}

Special algorithms were developed to optimize regularized objective
functions, most prominently the LARS and LARS-EN algorithm [@efron2004]
and variants thereof for the penalized Cox model [@penalizedpaper].
However, the aim of tramnet is to solve the objective functions arising
in regularized transformation models in a single computational
framework. Due to the log-concavity of all choices for $F$ in this
package and $h(y\rvert\text{\boldmath$x$},\text{\boldmath$s$})$ being
monotone increasing in $y$, the resulting log-likelihood contributions
for any form of censoring and truncation are concave and can thus be
solved by constrained convex optimization.

The fairly recent development of CVXR allows the specification of
constrained convex optimization problems in terms of a domain-specific
language, yielding an intuitive and highly flexible framework for
constrained optimization. Because checking the convexity of an
arbitrarily complex expression is extremely hard, CVXR makes use of a
library of smaller expressions, called atoms, with known monotonicity
and curvature and tries to decompose the objective at hand using a set
of rules from disciplined convex optimization [DCP, @DCPpaper]. Thus, a
complex expression's curvature can be more easily determined.

More formally, convex optimization aims at solving a problem of the form

$$\begin{aligned}
  \begin{array}{ll}
  	\underset{\text{\boldmath$\vartheta$}}{\mbox{minimize}} & g(\text{\boldmath$\vartheta$}) \\
  	\mbox{subject to} & g_i(\text{\boldmath$\vartheta$}) \leq 0, \; i = 1, \dots, K, \\
  	& \text{\boldmath$A$}\text{\boldmath$\vartheta$}= \text{\boldmath$b$},
  \end{array}\end{aligned}$$ where
$\text{\boldmath$\vartheta$}\in \mathbb{R}^p$ is the parameter vector,
$g(\text{\boldmath$\vartheta$})$ is the objective function to be
optimized, $g_i(\text{\boldmath$\vartheta$})$ specify the inequality
constraints, and $\text{\boldmath$A$}\in \mathbb{R}^{n \times p}$ and
$\text{\boldmath$b$}\in \mathbb{R}^p$ parameterize any equality
constraints on $\text{\boldmath$\vartheta$}$. Importantly, the objective
function and all inequality constraint functions are convex
[@boyd2004convex].

The likelihood
$\sum_i \ell(\text{\boldmath$\vartheta$}, \text{\boldmath$\beta$}; y_i, \text{\boldmath$s$}_i, \text{\boldmath$x$}_i)$
for transformation models of the form
([\[fm:trafo\]](#fm:trafo){reference-type="ref" reference="fm:trafo"})
are convex for error distributions with log-concave density because
log-convexity of $-{F'}$ ensures the existence and uniqueness of the
most likely transformation $\hat h$ and the convexity of
$-\ell(h; y, \text{\boldmath$x$})$. Because the penalty term is convex
in $\text{\boldmath$\beta$}$, it can be added to the negative
log-likelihood while conserving convexity. However, monotonicity of $h$
imposes inequality constraints on the parameters of the baseline
transformation, as illustrated in
equation [\[eq:const\]](#eq:const){reference-type="eqref"
reference="eq:const"}. The elegance of domain-specific language-based
optimizers comes to play when adding these and potential other
inequality or equality constraints to the objective function, which will
be showcased in Section . Thus, the optimization routines implemented in
package CVXR can be applied for computing maximum likelihood estimates
of the parameters of model
([\[fm:trafo\]](#fm:trafo){reference-type="ref" reference="fm:trafo"}).

## Model-based optimization {#subsec:mbo}

The predictive capabilities of regularized regression models heavily
depend on the hyperparameters $\alpha$ and $\lambda$. Hyperparameter
tuning can be addressed by a multitude of methods with varying
computational complexity, advantages, and disadvantages. Naive or random
grid search for more than one tuning parameter are computationally
demanding, especially if the objective function is expensive to
evaluate. Model-based optimization circumvents this issue by fitting a
surrogate model, usually a Gaussian process, to the objective function.
The objective function is evaluated at an initial, *e.g.*, , a random
latin hypercube, design, to which the Gaussian process is subsequently
fit. The surrogate model then proposes the next set of hyperparameters
at which to evaluate the objective function by some infill criterion
[@mbopaper]. @mlrMBO implement model-based optimization for
multi-objective blackbox functions in the mlrMBO package. The objective
function can, in theory, be vector-valued and the tuning parameter
spaces may be categorical. In tramnet, the objective function is the
cross-validated log-likelihood optimized using a Kriging surrogate model
with expected improvement as the infill criterion. Model-based
optimization for hyperparameter tuning is illustrated in Section .

## Basic usage {#subsec:usage}

The initial step is fitting a potentially stratified transformation
model of the form

::: example
R\> m1 \<- tram(y \| s   1, \...)
:::

omitting all explanatory variables. This sets up the basis expansion for
the transformation function, whose regression coefficients will not be
penalized, as mentioned in Section [1.2](#regul){reference-type="ref"
reference="regul"}. Additionally, `tramnet()` needs a model matrix
including the predictors, whose regression coefficients ought to be
penalized. For numerical reasons, it is useful to provide a scaled model
matrix instead of the original data, such that every parameter is
equally affected by the regularization. Lastly, `tramnet()` will need
the tuning parameters $\alpha \in [0, 1]$ and
$\lambda \in \mathbb{R}^+$, with $\alpha$ representing a mixing
parameter and $\lambda$ controlling the extent of regularization.
Setting $\lambda = 0$ will result in an unpenalized model, regardless of
the value of $\alpha$.

::: example
R\> x \<- model.matrix(  0 + x, \...) R\> x_scaled \<- scale(x) R\> mt
\<- tramnet(model = m1, x = x_scaled, lambda, alpha, \...)
:::

S3 methods accompanying the `"tramnet"` class will be discussed in
Section .

## Censoring and likelihood forms {#subsec:modelclasses}

Specific combinations of $F$ and the form of censoring yield
log-log-concave log-likelihoods. Under these circumstances, tramnet is
not yet able to solve the resulting optimization problem.
Table [1](#tab:models){reference-type="ref" reference="tab:models"}
indicates which model class can be fitted under what type of censoring
in the current version of tramnet.

::: {#tab:models}
  **Model Class**    **Censoring Type**                         
  ----------------- -------------------- ---------- ----------- --------------
                         **Exact**        **Left**   **Right**   **Interval**
  (l)2-5 BoxCox                                                 
  Colr                                                          
  Coxph                                                         
  Lehmann                                                       

  : Combinations of possible model classes and censoring types in the
  tramnet package. Due to missing optimization rules in CVXR, not every
  combination of error distribution and censoring type yield solvable

# Prostate cancer data analysis {#sec:prostateanalysis}

The regularized normal linear and extensions to transformed normal
regression models will be illustrated using the Prostate data set
[@stamey1989prostate], which was used by @zou2005regularization to
highlight properties of the elastic net.

::: example
R\> data(\"Prostate\", package = \"lasso2\") R\>
Prostate$psa <- exp(Prostate$lpsa) R\> Prostate\[, 1:8\] \<-
scale(Prostate\[, 1:8\])
:::

The data set contains 97 observations and 9 covariates. In the original
paper, the authors chose the log-transformed prostate specific antigen
concentration ( lpsa) as the response and used the eight remaining
predictors log cancer volume ( lcavol), log prostate weight ( lweight),
age of the patient ( age), log benign prostatic hyperplasia amount (
lbph), seminal vesicle invasion ( svi coded as 1 for yes, 0 for no), log
capsular penetration ( lcp), Gleason score ( gleason), and percentage
Gleason score 4 or 5 ( pgg45) as covariates.

## Linear and Box-Cox type regression models

@zou2005regularization imposed an assumption on the conditional
distribution of the response by log-transforming and fitting a linear
model. In the following, it is shown that the impact of this assumption
may be assessed by estimating the baseline transformation from the data,
followed by a comparison with the log-transformation applied by
@zou2005regularization. The linear models in lpsa and $\log($ psa$)$ are
compared to transformation models with basis expansions in both $\log($
psa$)$ and psa, while specifying conditional normality of the
transformed response. Additionally, the models are compared to an
alternative implementation of regularized normal linear regression in
penalized. Five different models will be used to illustrate important
facets of transformation models, including parameterization and
interpretation. The models are summarized in
Table [\[tab:mods\]](#tab:mods){reference-type="ref"
reference="tab:mods"} and will be elaborated on throughout this section.
The comparison is based on unpenalized models first. Later, the section
highlights the penalized models together with hyperparameter tuning.

::: example
R\> fm_Pr \<- psa   lcavol + lweight + age + lbph + svi + lcp +
gleason + pgg45 R\> fm_Pr1 \<- update(fm_Pr,   0 + .) R\> x \<-
model.matrix(fm_Pr1, data = Prostate)
:::

The normal linear regression model is implemented in tram's `Lm()`
function. `Lm()`'s parameterization differs from the usual linear model,
hence caution has to be taken when interpreting the resulting regression
coefficients $\text{\boldmath$\beta$}$. In order to compare the results
to an equivalent, already existing implementation, the same model is
fitted using penalized.

::: example
R\> m0 \<- Lm(lpsa   1, data = Prostate) R\> mt \<- tramnet(m0, x = x,
alpha = 0, lambda = 0) R\> mp \<- penalized(response =
Prostate$lpsa, penalized = x,
+                  lambda1 = 0, lambda2 = 0)
\end{example}
A linear model of the form

\begin{align*}
Y= \tilde{\alpha} + \text{\boldmath$x$}^\top \tilde{\text{\boldmath$\beta$}} + \varepsilon,
    \quad \varepsilon \sim \mathop{\mathrm{N}}(0, \sigma^2)
\end{align*}
can be understood as a transformation model through reparameterization as

\begin{align*} \label{Lm}
  \mathbb{P}(Y\le  y\rvert\text{\boldmath$X$}= \text{\boldmath$x$}) = \Phi\left(\vartheta_1 + \vartheta_2 y-
    \text{\boldmath$x$}^\top \text{\boldmath$\beta$}\right).
\end{align*}
Here,$\_1 = - / $is a reparameterized intercept term,$\_2 = 1 /
$is the slope of the baseline transformation, and the
regression coefficients$= / $represent
scaled shift terms, influencing only the intercept. To recover the usual
parameterization, \texttt{tramnet::coef.Lm()} offers the \texorpdfstring%
{{\normalfont\ttfamily\hyphenchar\font=-1 as.lm = TRUE}}%
{as.lm = TRUE} argument.
\begin{example}
R> cfx_tramnet <- coef(mt, as.lm = TRUE)
\end{example}
The transformation function for the linear model is depicted in 
Figure~\ref{fig:Prostate_trafos} (pink line).
Because a linear baseline transformation imposes restrictive assumptions on the
response's conditional distribution, it is advantageous to replace the linear baseline
transformation by a more flexible one. In the case of the Box-Cox type regression
model, the linear baseline transformation$h(y) = \_1 + \_2
y$is replaced by the basis expansion$h(y) = \_,7(y)\^$.
\begin{example}
R> ord <- 7 # flexible baseline transformation
R> m01 <- BoxCox(psa ~ 1, data = Prostate, order = ord,
+                extrapolate = TRUE, log_first = TRUE)
R> mt1 <- tramnet(m01, x = x, alpha = 0, lambda = 0)
\end{example}
The Box-Cox type regression model is then estimated with the \texttt{BoxCox()} function
while specifying the appropriate maximum order of the Bernstein polynomial.
Because the more flexible transformation slightly deviates from being linear, the normal
linear model yields a smaller log-likelihood (\emph{cf.} Table~\ref{tab:prostatemods}).
To make sure that this improvement is not due to the increased number of parameters
and hence overfitting, the models' predictive capacities could be compared via
cross-validation.

These results hold for the pre-specified log transformation of the response and
a basis expansion thereof. Instead of prespecifying the log-transformation, its
``logarithmic nature'' can be estimated from the data. Afterward, one can compare the
deviation from a log-linear baseline transformation graphically and by inspecting
the predictive performance of the model in terms of out-of-sample log-likelihood.
\begin{example}
R> m02 <- BoxCox(psa ~ 1, order = 11, data = Prostate, extrapolate = TRUE)
R> mt2 <- tramnet(m02, x = x, lambda = 0, alpha = 0)
\end{example}
Indeed, the baseline transformation in Figure~\ref{fig:Prostate_trafos} is
similar to the basis expansion in the log-transformed response upon visual inspection.
Because \texorpdfstring%
{{\normalfont\ttfamily\hyphenchar\font=-1 mt}}%
{mt} is estimated using the log-transformed response and \texorpdfstring%
{{\normalfont\ttfamily\hyphenchar\font=-1 mt1}}%
{mt1}
and \texorpdfstring%
{{\normalfont\ttfamily\hyphenchar\font=-1 mt2}}%
{mt2} are based on the original scale of the response, the resulting
model log-likelihoods are not comparable. To overcome this issue, one can fit a
Box-Cox type model with maximum order 1, as this results in a linear but
alternatively parameterized baseline transformation.
\begin{example}
R> m0p <- BoxCox(psa ~ 1, order = 1, data = Prostate, log_first = TRUE)
R> mtp <- tramnet(m0p, x = x, lambda = 0, alpha = 0)
\end{example}
Figure~\ref{fig:Prostate_trafos} plots the three distinct baseline transformations
resulting from models \texorpdfstring%
{{\normalfont\ttfamily\hyphenchar\font=-1 mt}}%
{mt}, \texorpdfstring%
{{\normalfont\ttfamily\hyphenchar\font=-1 mt1}}%
{mt1}, and \texorpdfstring%
{{\normalfont\ttfamily\hyphenchar\font=-1 mt2}}%
{mt2}. The initial assumption
to model the prostate-specific antigen concentration linearly on the log-scale
seems to be valid when comparing the three transformation functions.
The linear transformation in \texorpdfstring%
{{\normalfont\ttfamily\hyphenchar\font=-1 lpsa}}%
{lpsa} used in \texorpdfstring%
{{\normalfont\ttfamily\hyphenchar\font=-1 mt}}%
{mt}, and the basis expansion
in$($\texorpdfstring%
{{\normalfont\ttfamily\hyphenchar\font=-1 psa}}%
{psa}$)$(\texorpdfstring%
{{\normalfont\ttfamily\hyphenchar\font=-1 mt1}}%
{mt1}) are almost indistinguishable and yield very
similar coefficient estimates, as well as log-likelihoods (\emph{cf.} 
Table~\ref{tab:prostatemods}, \texorpdfstring%
{{\normalfont\ttfamily\hyphenchar\font=-1 mtp}}%
{mtp} \emph{vs.} \texorpdfstring%
{{\normalfont\ttfamily\hyphenchar\font=-1 mt1}}%
{mt1}). The basis expansion
in \texorpdfstring%
{{\normalfont\ttfamily\hyphenchar\font=-1 psa}}%
{psa} (\texorpdfstring%
{{\normalfont\ttfamily\hyphenchar\font=-1 mt2}}%
{mt2}) is expected to be less stable due to the highly skewed
untransformed response. This is reflected in Figure~\ref{fig:Prostate_trafos},
where the baseline transformation deviates from being linear towards the bounds
of the response's support. However, the log-linear behavior of$h$was clearly
captured by this model and further supported the initial assumption of conditional
log-normality of the response. For the same reasons, the resulting log-likelihood
of \texorpdfstring%
{{\normalfont\ttfamily\hyphenchar\font=-1 mt2}}%
{mt2} is smaller than for \texorpdfstring%
{{\normalfont\ttfamily\hyphenchar\font=-1 mt1}}%
{mt1} (Table~\ref{tab:prostatemods}). Taken together,
this exemplary analysis highlights the flexibility and usefulness of transformation
models to judge crucial modeling assumptions.

{mt} is of the form: $h(\mathrm{lpsa}) = \vartheta_1 + \vartheta_2 \cdot
\mathrm{lpsa}$. Now, one can allow a more flexible transformation function in
$\log($\texorpdfstring%
{{\normalfont\ttfamily\hyphenchar\font=-1 psa}}%
{psa}$)$ to judge any deviations of $h(\log(\mathrm{psa}))$ from
linearity, leading to a baseline transformation in terms of basis functions:
$\text{\boldmath$a$}_{\text{Bs},7}(\log(\mathrm{psa}))^\top \text{\boldmath$\vartheta$}$ in \texorpdfstring%
{{\normalfont\ttfamily\hyphenchar\font=-1 mt1}}%
{mt1}. Lastly, instead of
presuming a log-transformation, one could estimate the baseline transformation
from the raw response (\texorpdfstring%
{{\normalfont\ttfamily\hyphenchar\font=-1 psa}}%
{psa}), \textit{i.e.},~$h(\mathrm{psa}) = \text{\boldmath$a$}_{\text{Bs},11}
(\mathrm{psa})^\top \text{\boldmath$\vartheta$}$ in \texorpdfstring%
{{\normalfont\ttfamily\hyphenchar\font=-1 mt2}}%
{mt2}. In this case, a higher-order basis
expansion was chosen to account for the skewness of the raw response. Notably,
all three baseline transformations are fairly comparable. The basis expansion
in \texorpdfstring%
{{\normalfont\ttfamily\hyphenchar\font=-1 psa}}%
{psa} deviates from being log-linear towards the boundaries of the
response's support, as there are only a few observations.}

\subsection{Hyperparameter tuning} \label{sec:tuning}

This section features cross-validation, model-based optimization, and profiling functions
for hyperparameter tuning, whose appropriate values are highly problem-dependent
and hard to know in advance. \texorpdfstring%
{{\normalfont\fontseries{b}\selectfont tramnet}}%
{tramnet} implements naive grid search and model-based
optimization in the functions \texttt{cvl\_tramnet()} and \texttt{tramnet\_mbo()}, respectively.
In the framework of regularized transformation models, it is very natural to choose
the out-of-sample log-likelihood as the objective function because
the notion of a mean square loss does not make sense for survival, let alone
censored outcomes. The out-of-sample log-likelihood is, in fact, the log score,
which is a proper scoring rule \citep{Gneiting_Raftery_2007}.
\begin{example}
R> m0 <- BoxCox(lpsa ~ 1, data = Prostate, order = 7, extrapolate = TRUE)
R> mt <- tramnet(m01, x = x, alpha = 1, lambda = 0)
\end{example}
\texorpdfstring%
{{\normalfont\fontseries{b}\selectfont tramnet}}%
{tramnet} offers cross-validation in \texttt{cvl\_tramnet()}, comparable to the
\texttt{optL1()}, and \texttt{optL2()} functions in \texorpdfstring%
{{\normalfont\fontseries{b}\selectfont penalized}}%
{penalized}, which takes a sequence
of values for$$and$$and performs a simple --~and arguably slow~--
grid search. Per default, it computes 2-fold cross-validation. The user is encouraged,
however, to judge the resulting bias-variance trade-off accordingly.
\begin{example}
R> lambdas <- c(0, 10^seq(-4, log10(15), length.out = 4))
R> cvlt <- cvl_tramnet(object = mt, fold = 2, lambda = lambdas, alpha = 1)
\end{example}
In order to compare cross-validation across multiple packages and functions, it
is also possible to supply the folds for each row in the design matrix as a
numeric vector, as for example returned by \texttt{penalized::optL1()}.
\begin{example}
R> pen_cvl <- optL1(response = lpsa, penalized = x, lambda2 = 0, data = Prostate,
+                   fold = 2)
R> cvlt <- cvl_tramnet(object = mt, lambda = lambdas, alpha = 1,
+                      folds = pen_cvl$fold)
:::

The resulting object is of class `"cvl_tramnet"` and contains a table
for the cross-validated log-likelihoods for each fold and the sum
thereof, the 'optimal' tuning parameter constellation, which resulted in
the largest cross-validated log-likelihood, tables for the
cross-validated regularization paths, the folds and lastly the full fit
based on the 'optimal' tuning parameters. Additionally, the resulting
object can be used to visualize the log-likelihood and coefficient
trajectories. These trajectories highly depend on the chosen folds, and
the user is referred to the full profiling functions discussed in
Section .

### Model-based optimization {#subsec:prostatembo}

In contrast to naive grid search, model-based optimization comprises
more elegant methods for hyperparameter tuning. tramnet offers the
`mbo_tramnet()` and `mbo_recommended()` functions. The former implements
Kriging-based hyperparameter tuning for the elastic net, the Lasso, and
ridge regression. `mbo_tramnet()` takes a `"tramnet"` object as input
and computes the cross-validated log-likelihood based on the provided
fold or folds argument. The initial design is a random latin hypercube
design with n_design rows per parameter. The number of sequential fits
of the surrogate models is specified through n_iter, and the range of
the tuning parameters can be specified by max/min arguments. The default
infill criterion is expected improvement. However, @mlrMBO encourage the
use of the lower confidence bound over expected improvement, which can
be achieved in `mbo_tramnet()` by specifying
opt_crit = makeMBOInfillCritCB(). 10-fold cross-validation is used to
compute the objective function for the initial design and each
iteration. The recommended model is then extracted using
`mbo_recommended()`.

::: example
R\> tmbo \<- mbo_tramnet(mt, obj_type = \"elnet\", fold = 10) R\> mtmbo
\<- mbo_recommended(tmbo, m0, x)
:::

Unlike in the previous section, one can directly optimize the tuning
parameters in an elastic net problem instead of optimizing over one
hyperparameter at a time or having to specify Lasso or ridge regression
*a priori*. The output of `mbo_tramnet()` is quite verbose and can be
shortened by using the helper function `print_mbo()`.

::: example
R\> print_mbo(tmbo)

\## Recommended parameters: \## lmb=1.04e-05; alp=0.751 \## Objective: y
= 710
:::

Interpreting the output, model-based optimization suggests an
unpenalized model with $\alpha = 0.75$ and $\lambda = 0$. This result
stresses the advantages of model-based optimization over naive or random
grid search in terms of complexity and computational efficiency. In the
end, the proposed model is unpenalized and thus does not introduce
sparsity in the regression coefficients.

::: example
R\> coef(mtmbo)

\## lcavol lweight age lbph svi lcp gleason pgg45 \## 1.0312 0.3380
-0.2068 0.2198 0.4801 -0.2329 0.0437 0.2157

R\> summary(mtmbo)$sparsity

\end{example}

\subsubsection{Regularization paths} \label{subsec:prof}

As discussed before, it may be useful to inspect the full regularization paths
over the tuning parameters$$and$$. Akin to the functions \texttt{profL1()}
and \texttt{profL2()} in package \texorpdfstring%
{{\normalfont\fontseries{b}\selectfont penalized}}%
{penalized}, \texorpdfstring%
{{\normalfont\fontseries{b}\selectfont tramnet}}%
{tramnet} offers \texttt{prof\_lambda()}
and \texttt{prof\_alpha()}. Since these functions take a fitted model of class
\texttt{"tramnet"} as input, which is internally updated, it is crucial to correctly
specify the other tuning parameter in the model fitting step. In the example to
come, \texorpdfstring%
{{\normalfont\ttfamily\hyphenchar\font=-1 mt}}%
{mt} was fit using$= 1$and$= 0$, resulting in a
Lasso penalty only when profiling over$$. The resulting profile is depicted
in Figure~\ref{fig:prof}.
\begin{example}
R> pfl <- prof_lambda(mt)
\end{example}
\texttt{prof\_lambda()} takes \texorpdfstring%
{{\normalfont\ttfamily\hyphenchar\font=-1 min\_lambda}}%
{min\_lambda}, \texorpdfstring%
{{\normalfont\ttfamily\hyphenchar\font=-1 max\_lambda}}%
{max\_lambda}, and \texorpdfstring%
{{\normalfont\ttfamily\hyphenchar\font=-1 nprof}}%
{nprof}
as arguments and internally generates an equi-spaced sequence from \texorpdfstring%
{{\normalfont\ttfamily\hyphenchar\font=-1 min\_lambda}}%
{min\_lambda}
to \texorpdfstring%
{{\normalfont\ttfamily\hyphenchar\font=-1 max\_lambda}}%
{max\_lambda} on the log scale of length \texorpdfstring%
{{\normalfont\ttfamily\hyphenchar\font=-1 nprof}}%
{nprof}. By default, this
sequence ranges from$`<!-- -->`{=html}0$to$`<!-- -->`{=html}15$and is of length$`<!-- -->`{=html}5$.
\begin{example}
R> plot_path(pfl, plot_logLik = FALSE, las = 1, col = coll)
\end{example}

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=1\textwidth]{profiling_plot-1} 
\caption{Full regularization paths for the tuning parameter $\lambda$ using the
default values of \texttt{plot\_path()}.}
\label{fig:prof}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Additional constraints} \label{subsec:otherconstr}

In some applications, the specification of additional constraints on the shift
parameters$$are of interest. Most commonly, either positivity or
negativity for some or all regression coefficients is aimed at. In \texorpdfstring%
{{\normalfont\fontseries{b}\selectfont tramnet}}%
{tramnet},
additional inequality constraints can be specified via the \texorpdfstring%
{{\normalfont\ttfamily\hyphenchar\font=-1 constraints}}%
{constraints} argument,
which are internally handled as \texorpdfstring%
{{\normalfont\ttfamily\hyphenchar\font=-1 constraints[[1]] \%*\% beta $>$ constraints[[2]]}}%
{constraints[[1]] \%*\% beta $>$ constraints[[2]]}. 
Hence, to specify the constraint of strictly positive regression coefficients, 
one would supply an identity matrix of dimension$p$for the left-hand side and
the zero$p$-vector for the right-hand side, as done in the following example.
\begin{example}
R> m0 <- BoxCox(lpsa ~ 1, data = Prostate, extrapolate = TRUE)
R> mt <- tramnet(m0, x, alpha = 0, lambda = 0, constraints = list(diag(8),
+                                                                 rep(0, 8)))
R> coef(mt)

## lcavol lweight    lbph     svi gleason   pgg45 
## 0.9111  0.2996  0.1684  0.3969  0.0133  0.1125 
\end{example}
The coefficients with a negative sign in the model without additional positivity
constraints now shrink to zero, with the other coefficient estimates changing
as well.
\begin{example}
R> summary(mt)$sparsity

\## \[1\] \"8 regression coefficients, 6 of which are non-zero\"
:::

One can compare this model to the implementation in tram, where it is
also possible to specify linear inequality constraints on the regression
coefficients $\text{\boldmath$\beta$}$. Here, it is sufficient to
specify constraints = c(\"age \>= 0\", \"lcp \>= 0\") for the two
non-positive coefficient estimates.

::: example
R\> m \<- BoxCox(lpsa   . - psa, data = Prostate, extrapolate = TRUE, +
constraints = c(\"age \>= 0\", \"lcp \>= 0\")) R\> max(abs(coef(m) -
coef(mt, tol = 0)))

\## \[1\] 1.28e-05
:::

Indeed, both optimizers arrive at virtually the same coefficient
estimates.

#  S3 Methods {#sec:methods}

Building on the S3 infrastructure of the packages
[mlt](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=mlt) and tram, this package
provides corresponding methods for the following generics: `coef()`,
`logLik()`, `plot()`, `predict()`, `simulate()`, and `residuals()`. The
methods' additional `"tramnet"`-specific arguments will be briefly
discussed in this section.

`coef.tramnet()` suppresses the baseline transformation's coefficient
estimates $\hat\text{\boldmath$\vartheta$}$ by default and considers
shift parameter estimates $\hat\text{\boldmath$\beta$}$ below $10^{-6}$
as $0$ to stress the selected variables only. This threshold can be
controlled by the tol argument. Hence, coef(mt, with_baseline = TRUE,
tol = 0) returns all coefficients.

::: example
R\> coef(mtmbo, with_baseline = TRUE, tol = 0)

\## Bs1(lpsa) Bs2(lpsa) Bs3(lpsa) Bs4(lpsa) Bs5(lpsa) Bs6(lpsa)
Bs7(lpsa) \## -1.9775 -1.5055 -1.0335 -0.2778 -0.2778 1.0723 1.5150 \##
Bs8(lpsa) lcavol lweight age lbph svi lcp \## 1.9576 1.0312 0.3380
-0.2068 0.2198 0.4801 -0.2329 \## gleason pgg45 \## 0.0437 0.2157
:::

The `logLik.tramnet()` method allows the log-likelihoods re-computation
under new data (*i.e.*, out-of-sample) and different coefficients (
parm) and weights ( w), as illustrated below.

In the spirit of mlt's plotting methods for classes `"mlt"` and `"ctm"`,
`plot.tramnet()` offers diverse plotting options for objects of class
`"tramnet"`. The specification of new data and the type of plot is
illustrated in the following code chunk and
Figure [1](#fig:plot){reference-type="ref" reference="fig:plot"}.

::: example
R\> par(mfrow = c(3, 2)); K \<- 1e3 R\> plot(mtmbo, type =
\"distribution\", K = K, main = \"A\") \# A, default R\> plot(mtmbo,
type = \"survivor\", K = K, main = \"B\") \# B R\> plot(mtmbo, type =
\"trafo\", K = K, main = \"C\") \# C R\> plot(mtmbo, type = \"density\",
K = K, main = \"D\") \# D R\> plot(mtmbo, type = \"hazard\", K = K, main
= \"E\") \# E R\> plot(mtmbo, type = \"trafo\", newdata = Prostate\[1,
\], col = 1, K = K, main = \"F\") \# F
:::

![Illustration of `plot.tramnet()`'s versatility in visualizing the
response's estimated conditional distribution on various scales,
including cdf, survivor, transformation scale and pdf. Note that, by
default, the plot is produced for each row in the design matrix. In
unstratified linear transformation models, this leads to shifted
versions of the same curve on the transformation function's scale. A:
Estimated conditional distribution function for every observation. B:
Estimated conditional survivor function for every observation. The
conditional survivor function is defined as
$S(y\rvert\text{\boldmath$x$}) = 1 - F_Y(y\rvert\text{\boldmath$x$})$.
C: Conditional most likely transformation for every observation. Note
that every conditional transformation function is a shifted version of
the same curve. D: The conditional density for every observation can be
calculated using
$f_Y(y\rvert\text{\boldmath$x$}) = F'(\text{\boldmath$a$}(y)^\top\text{\boldmath$\vartheta$}- \text{\boldmath$x$}^\top\text{\boldmath$\beta$})\text{\boldmath$a$}'
  (y)^\top\text{\boldmath$\vartheta$}$. E: A distribution function is
fully characterized by its hazard function
$\lambda(y\rvert\text{\boldmath$x$}) = f_Y(y\rvert\text{\boldmath$x$}) / S(y\rvert\text{\boldmath$x$})$,
which is depicted in this panel. F: The newdata argument can be used to
plot the predicted most likely transformation for the provided data, in
this case, the first row of the Prostate
data.](plot_method_fig-1.pdf){#fig:plot}

The `predict.tramnet()` method works in the same way as `predict.mlt()`
and as such supports the types trafo, distribution, survivor, density,
logdensity, hazard, loghazard, cumhazard, and quantile. For type =
\"quantile\", the corresponding probabilities ( prob) have to be
supplied as an argument to evaluate the quantile function.

::: example
R\> predict(mtmbo, type = \"quantile\", prob = 0.2, newdata =
Prostate\[1:5,\])

\## prob \[,1\] \[,2\] \[,3\] \[,4\] \[,5\] \## 0.2 3.4 3.55 3.74 3.72
2.68
:::

Another method offered by this package implements parametric
bootstrap-based sampling. In particular, `simulate.tramnet()` calls the
`simulate.ctm()` function after converting the `"tramnet"` object to a
`"ctm"` object.

::: example
R\> simulate(mtmbo, nsim = 1, newdata = Prostate\[1:5,\], seed = 1)

\## \[1\] 3.56 3.97 4.57 5.48 2.69
:::

Lastly, `residuals.tramnet()` computes the generalized residual $r$
defined as the score contribution for sample $i$ with respect to a newly
introduced intercept parameter $\gamma$, which is restricted to be zero.
In particular,

$$\begin{aligned}
  r = \frac{\partial \ell\left(\text{\boldmath$\vartheta$},\text{\boldmath$\beta$},\gamma;y, \text{\boldmath$s$}, \text{\boldmath$x$}\right)}{\partial
    \gamma} \bigg\rvert_{\gamma = 0}\end{aligned}$$ yields the
generalized residual with respect to $\gamma$ for the model

$$\begin{aligned}
  F_Y(y\rvert\text{\boldmath$s$}, \text{\boldmath$x$}) = F\left(h(y \mid \text{\boldmath$s$}) - \text{\boldmath$x$}^\top \text{\boldmath$\beta$}- \gamma \right).\end{aligned}$$

::: example
R\> residuals(mtmbo)\[1:5\]

\## \[1\] -6.50 -6.36 -6.60 -6.57 -4.17
:::

In residual analysis and boosting, it is common practice to check for
associations between residuals and covariates that are not included in
the model. In the prostate cancer example, one could investigate whether
the variables age and lcp should be included in the model. To illustrate
this particular case, a nonparametric `independence_test()` from package
[coin](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=coin) can be used [@coinjss].
First, the uncoditional transformation model m0 is fitted. Afterward,
the tramnet models excluding age and lcp are estimated, and their
residuals extracted using the `residuals.tramnet()` method. Lastly, an
independence test using a maximum statistic ( teststat = \"max\") and a
Monte Carlo-based approximation of the null distribution based on
resampling $10^6$ times ( distribution = approximate(1e6)) yields the
results printed below.

::: example
R\> library(\"coin\") R\> m0 \<- BoxCox(lpsa   1, data = Prostate,
extrapolate = TRUE) R\> x_no_age_lcp \<- x\[, !colnames(x) R\>
mt_no_age_lcp \<- tramnet(m0, x_no_age_lcp, alpha = 0, lambda = 0) R\> r
\<- residuals(mt_no_age_lcp) R\> it \<- independence_test(r   age + lcp,
data = Prostate, + teststat = \"max\", distribution = approximate(1e6))
R\> pvalue(it, \"single-step\")

\## age 0.023748 \## lcp \<0.000001
:::

Because there is substantial evidence against the independence of the
models' residuals to either lcp or age, we can conclude that it is
worthwhile to include age and lcp in the model. Packages
[trtf](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=trtf) [@pkg:trtf] and
[tbm](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=tbm)
[@hothorn2019tbm; @pkg:tbm] make use of this definition of a residual
for estimating and boosting transformation models, trees, and random
forests. For more theoretical insight, the reader is referred to the
above mentioned publications.
