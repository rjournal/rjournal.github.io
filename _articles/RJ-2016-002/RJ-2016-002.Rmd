title: Gender Prediction Methods Based on First Names with genderizeR
abstract: In recent years, there has been increased interest in methods for gender
  prediction based on first names that employ various open data sources. These methods
  have applications from bibliometric studies to customizing commercial offers for
  web users. Analysis of gender disparities in science based on such methods are published
  in the most prestigious journals, although they could be improved by choosing the
  most suited prediction method with optimal parameters and performing validation
  studies using the best data source for a given purpose. There is also a need to
  monitor and report how well a given prediction method works in comparison to others.
  In this paper, the author recommends a set of tools (including one dedicated to
  gender prediction, the R package called genderizeR), data sources (including the
  genderize.io API), and metrics that could be fully reproduced and tested in order
  to choose the optimal approach suitable for different gender analyses.
