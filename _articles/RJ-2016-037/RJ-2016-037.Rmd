title: 'Qtools: A Collection of Models and Tools for Quantile Inference'
abstract: Quantiles play a fundamental role in statistics. The quantile function defines
  the distribution of a random variable and, thus, provides a way to describe the
  data that is specular but equivalent to that given by the corresponding cumulative
  distribution function. There are many advantages in working with quantiles, starting
  from their properties. The renewed interest in their usage seen in the last years
  is due to the theoretical, methodological, and software contributions that have
  broadened their applicability. This paper presents the R package Qtools, a collection
  of utilities for unconditional and conditional quantiles.
