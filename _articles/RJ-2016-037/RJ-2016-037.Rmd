title: 'Qtools: A Collection of Models and Tools for Quantile Inference'
abstract: Quantiles play a fundamental role in statistics. The quantile function defines
  the distribution of a random variable and, thus, provides a way to describe the
  data that is specular but equivalent to that given by the corresponding cumulative
  distribution function. There are many advantages in working with quantiles, starting
  from their properties. The renewed interest in their usage seen in the last years
  is due to the theoretical, methodological, and software contributions that have
  broadened their applicability. This paper presents the R package *Qtools*, a collection
  of utilities for unconditional and conditional quantiles.

# Introduction

Quantiles have a long history in applied statistics, especially the
median. The analysis of astronomical data by Galileo Galilei in 1632
[@hald_2003 p.149] and geodic measurements by Roger Boscovich in 1757
[@koenker_2005 p.2] are presumably the earliest examples of application
of the least absolute deviation ($L_1$) estimator in its, respectively,
unconditional and conditional forms. The theoretical studies on
quantiles of continuous random variables started to appear in the
statistical literature of the 20th century. In the case of discrete
data, studies have somewhat lagged behind most probably because of the
analytical drawbacks surrounding the discontinuities that characterise
discrete quantile functions. Some forms of approximation to continuity
have been recently proposed to study the large sample behavior of
quantile estimators. For example, @ma_etal_2011 have demonstrated the
asymptotic normality of unconditional sample quantiles based on the
definition of the mid-distribution function [@parzen_2004].
@machado_silva_2005 proposed inferential approaches to the estimation of
conditional quantiles for counts based on data jittering.

Functions implementing quantile methods can be found in common
statistical software. A considerable number of R packages that provide
such functions are available on the Comprehensive R Archive Network
(CRAN). The base package *stats* contains basic functions to estimate
sample quantiles or compute quantiles of common parametric
distributions. The
[*quantreg*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=quantreg) package
[@quantreg] is arguably a benchmark for distribution-free estimation of
linear quantile regression models, as well as the base for other
packages which make use of linear programming (LP) algorithms
[@koenker_dorey; @koenker_park_1996]. Other contributions to the
modelling of conditional quantile functions include packages for
Bayesian regression,
e.g. [*bayesQR*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=bayesQR)
[@benoit_etal] and
[*BSquare*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=BSquare) [@smith_reich],
and the [*lqmm*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=lqmm) package
[@geraci_bottai_2014; @geraci_2104] for random-effects regression.

The focus of this paper is on the R package
[*Qtools*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=Qtools), a collection of
models and tools for quantile inference. These include commands for

-   quantile-based analysis of the location, scale and shape of a
    distribution;

-   transformation-based quantile regression;

-   goodness of fit and restricted quantile regression;

-   quantile regression for discrete data;

-   quantile-based multiple imputation.

The emphasis will be put on the first two topics listed above as they
represent the main contribution of the package, while a short
description of the other topics is given for completeness.

# Unconditional quantiles

## Definition and estimation of quantiles

Let $Y$ be a random variable with cumulative distribution function (CDF)
$F_{Y}$ and support $S_{Y}$. The CDF calculated at $y \in S_{Y}$ returns
the probability $F_{Y}(y) \equiv p = \Pr(Y \leq y)$. The quantile
function (QF) is defined as $Q(p) = \inf_{y}\{F_{Y}(y) \geq p\}$, for
$0 < p < 1$. (Some authors consider $0 \leq p \leq 1$. For practical
purposes, it is simpler to exclude the endpoints 0 and 1.) When $F_{Y}$
is continuous and strictly monotone (hence,
$f_{Y}(y) \equiv F_{Y}'(y) > 0$ for all $y \in S_{Y}$), the quantile
function is simply the inverse of $F_{Y}$. In other cases, the quantile
$p$ is defined, by convention, as the smallest value $y$ such that
$F_{Y}(y)$ is at least $p$.

Quantiles enjoy a number of properties. An excellent overview is given
by @gilchirst_2000. In particular, the **Q-tranformation rule**
[@gilchirst_2000] or equivariance to monotone transformations states
that if $h(\cdot)$ is a non-decreasing function on $\mathbb{R}$, then
$Q_{h(Y)}(p) = h\left\{Q_{Y}(p)\right\}$. Hence
$Q_{Y}(p) = h^{-1}\left\{Q_{h(Y)}(p)\right\}$. Note that this property
does not generally hold for the expected value.

Sample quantiles for a random variable $Y$ can be calculated in a number
of ways, depending on how they are defined [@hyndman_fan_1996]. For
example, the function `quantile()` in the base package *stats* provides
nine different sample quantile estimators, which are based on the sample
order statistics or the inverse of the empirical CDF. These estimators
are distribution-free as they do not depend on any parametric assumption
about $F$ (or $Q$).

Let $Y_{1}, Y_{2}, \ldots, Y_{n}$ be a sample of $n$ independent and
identically distributed (iid) observations from the population $F_{Y}$.
Let $\xi_p$ denote the $p$th population quantile and $\hat{\xi}_p$ the
corresponding sample quantile. (The subscripts will be dropped
occasionally to ease notation, e.g. $F$ will be used in place of $F_{Y}$
or $\xi$ in place of $\xi_{p}$.) In the continuous case, it is well
known that $\sqrt{n}\left(\hat{\xi}_{p} - \xi_{p}\right)$ is
approximately normal with mean zero and variance
$$\label{eq:1}
\omega^2 = \frac{p(1-p)}{\{f_{Y}(\xi_p)\}^2}.   (\#eq:1)$$
A more general result is obtained when the $Y_{i}$'s, $i = 1, \ldots,
n$, are independent but not identically distributed (nid). The density
evaluated at the $p$th quantile, $f(\xi_p)$, is called the
density-quantile function by [@parzen_1979]. Its reciprocal,
$s(p) \equiv 1/f(\xi_p)$, is called the sparsity function [@tukey] or
quantile-density function [@parzen_1979].

As mentioned previously, the discontinuities of $F_{Y}$ when $Y$ is
discrete represent a mathematical inconvenience. @ma_etal_2011 derived
the asymptotic distribution of the sample mid-quantiles, that is, the
sample quantiles based on the mid-distribution function (mid-CDF). The
latter is defined as $F^{mid}_{Y}(y) = F_{Y}(y) - 0.5p_{Y}(y)$, where
$p_{Y}(y)$ denotes the probability mass function [@parzen_2004]. In
particular, they showed that, as $n$ becomes large,
$\sqrt{n}\left(\hat{\xi}^{mid}_{p} - \xi_{p}\right)$ is approximately
normal with mean $0$. Under iid assumptions, the expression for the
sampling variance is similar to that in (\@ref(eq:1)); see @ma_etal_2011
for details.

The package *Qtools* provides the functions `midecdf()` and
`midquantile()`, which return objects of class `"midecdf"` or
`"midquantile"`, respectively, containing: the values or the
probabilities at which mid-cumulative probabilities or mid-quantiles are
calculated (`x`), the mid-cumulative probabilities or the mid-quantiles
(`y`), and the functions that linearly interpolate those coordinates
(`fn`). An example is shown below using data simulated from a Poisson
distribution.

``` r
> library("Qtools")
> set.seed(467)
> y <- rpois(1000, 4)
> pmid <- midecdf(y)
> xmid <- midquantile(y, probs = pmid$y)
> pmid

Empirical mid-ECDF
Call:
midecdf(x = y)

> xmid

Empirical mid-ECDF
Call:
midquantile(x = y, probs = pmid$y)
```

A confidence interval for sample mid-quantiles can be obtained using
`confint.midquantile()`. This function is applied to the output of
`midquantile()` and returns an object of class `"data.frame"` containing
sample mid-quantiles, lower and upper bounds of the confidence intervals
of a given level ($95\%$ by default), along with standard errors as an
attribute named `stderr`. This is shown below using the sample `y`
generated in the previous example.

``` r
> xmid <- midquantile(y, probs = 1:3/4)
> x <- confint(xmid, level = 0.95)
> x

    midquantile    lower    upper
25%    2.540000 2.416462 2.663538
50%    3.822816 3.693724 3.951907
75%    5.254902 5.072858 5.436946

> attr(x, "stderr")
[1] 0.06295447 0.06578432 0.09276875
```

Finally, a plot method is available for both `midecdf()` and
`midquantile()` objects. An illustration is given in Figure [1](#fig:1).
The mid-distribution and mid-quantile functions are discrete and their
values are marked by filled squares. The piecewise linear functions
connecting the filled squares represent continuous versions of the CDF
and QF which interpolate between the steps of, respectively, the
ordinary CDF and quantile functions. Note that the argument `jumps` is a
logical value indicating whether values at jumps should be marked.

``` r
> par(mfrow = c(1,2))
> plot(pmid, xlab = "y", ylab = "CDF", jumps = TRUE)
> points(pmid$x, pmid$y, pch = 15)
> plot(xmid, xlab = "p", ylab = "Quantile", jumps = TRUE)
> points(xmid$x, xmid$y, pch = 15)
```

![Figure 1: Cumulative distribution (a) and quantile (b) functions for
simulated Poisson data. The ordinary cumulative distribution function
(CDF) and quantile function (QF) are represented by step-functions (grey
lines), with the convention that, at the point of discontinuity or jump,
the function takes its value corresponding to the ordinate of the filled
circle as opposed to that of the hollow circle. The mid-CDF and mid-QF
are represented by filled squares, while the piecewise linear functions
(dashed lines) connecting the squares represent continuous versions of,
respectively, the ordinary CDF and QF.](fig1.png){#fig:1 width="100%" alt="graphic without alt text"}

## LSS - Location, scale and shape of a distribution

Since the cumulative distribution and quantile functions are two sides
of the same coin, the location, scale, and shape (LSS) of a distribution
can be examined using one or the other. Well-known quantile-based
measures of location and scale are the median and inter-quartile range
(IQR), respectively. Similarly, there are also a number of
quantile-based measures for skewness and kurtosis
[@groeneveld_meeden_1984; @groeneveld_1998; @jones_etal_2011].

Define the central portion of the distribution as that delimited by the
quantiles $Q(p)$ and $Q(1-p)$, $0 < p < 0.5$, and define the tail
portion as that lying outside these quantiles. Let
$IPR(p) = Q(1-p) - Q(p)$ denote the inter-quantile range at level $p$.
Building on the results by @horn_1983 and @ruppert_1987, @staudte_2014
considered the following identity:
$$\label{eq:2}
\underbrace{\frac{IPR(p)}{IPR(r)}}_\text{kurtosis} = \underbrace{\frac{IPR(p)}{IPR(q)}}_\text{tail-weight} \, \cdot \, \underbrace{\frac{IPR(q)}{IPR(r)}}_\text{peakedness},   (\#eq:2)$$
where $0 < p < q < r < 0.5$. These quantile-based measures of shape are
sign, location and scale invariant. As compared to moment-based indices,
they are also more robust to outliers and easier to interpret
[@groeneveld_1998; @jones_etal_2011].

It is easy to verify that a quantile function can be written as
$$\label{eq:3}
Q(p) = \underbrace{Q(0.5)}_\text{median}\,\, + \,\, \frac{1}{2}\underbrace{IPR(0.25)}_\text{IQR} \, \cdot \, \underbrace{\frac{IPR(p)}{IPR(0.25)}}_\text{shape index} \, \cdot \, \bigg(\underbrace{\frac{Q(p) + Q(1-p) - 2Q(0.5)}{IPR(p)}}_\text{skewness index} - 1\bigg).   (\#eq:3)$$
This identity establishes a relationship between the location (median),
scale (IQR) and shape of a distribution. (This identity appears in
@gilchirst_2000 [p.74] with an error of sign. See also
@benjamini_krieger_1996 [eq.1].) The quantity $IPR(p)/IPR(0.25)$ in
(\@ref(eq:3)) is loosely defined as the shape index [@gilchirst_2000
p.72], although it can be seen as the tail-weight measure given in
(\@ref(eq:2)) when $p < 0.25$. For symmetric distributions, the
contribution of the skewness index vanishes. Note that the skewness
index not only is location and scale invariant, but is also bounded
between $-1$ and $1$ (as opposed to the Pearson's third standardised
moment which can be infinite or even undefined). When this index is near
the bounds $-1$ or $1$, then $Q(1-p) \approx Q(0.5)$ or
$Q(p) \approx Q(0.5)$, respectively.

The function `qlss()` provides a quantile-based LSS summary with the
indices defined in (\@ref(eq:3)) of either a theoretical or an empirical
distribution. It returns an object of class `"qlss"`, which is a list
containing measures of location (median), scale (IQR and IPR), and shape
(skewness and shape indices) for each of the probabilities specified in
the argument `probs` (by default, `probs` = 0.1). The quantile-based LSS
summary of the normal distribution is given in the example below for
$p =0.1$. The argument `fun` can take any quantile function whose
probability argument is named `p` (this is the case for many standard
quantile functions in R, e.g. `qt()`, `qchisq()`, `qf()`, etc. ).

``` r
> qlss(fun = "qnorm", probs = 0.1)

call:
qlss.default(fun = "qnorm", probs = 0.1)

An empirical example is now illustrated using the `faithful` data set,
which contains $272$ observations on waiting time (minutes) between
eruptions and the duration (minutes) of the eruption for the Old
Faithful geyser in Yellowstone National Park, Wyoming, USA. Summary
statistics are given in Table [1](#tab:1-geraci).

Suppose the interest is in describing the distribution of waiting times.
The density is plotted in Figure [2](#fig:2), along with the
mid-quantile function. The distribution is bimodal with peaks at around
$54$ and $80$ minutes. Note that the arguments of the base function
`quantile()`, including the argument `type`, can be passed on to
`qlss()`.

``` r
> y <- faithful$waiting
> par(mfrow = c(1,2))
> plot(density(y))
> plot(midquantile(y, probs = p), jumps = FALSE)
> qlss(y, probs = c(0.05, 0.1, 0.25), type = 7)

call:
qlss.numeric(x = y, probs = c(0.05, 0.1, 0.25), type = 7)

Unconditional Quantile-Based Location, Scale, and Shape

** Location **
Median
[1] 76
** Scale **
Inter-quartile range (IQR)
[1] 24
Inter-quantile range (IPR)
0.05  0.1 0.25
  41   35   24
** Shape **
Skewness index
      0.05        0.1       0.25
-0.3658537 -0.4285714 -0.5000000
Shape index
    0.05      0.1     0.25
1.708333 1.458333 1.000000
```

At $p = 0.1$, the skewness index is approximately $-0.43$, which denotes
a rather strong left asymmetry. As for the shape index, which is equal
to $1.46$, one could say that the tails of this distribution weigh less
than those of a normal distribution ($1.90$), though of course a
comparison between unimodal and bimodal distributions is not meaningful.

# Conditional quantiles

## Linear models

In general, the $p$th linear QR model is of the form
$$\label{eq:4}
Q_{Y|X}(p) = \mathbf{x}^{\top}\boldsymbol \beta(p)   (\#eq:4)$$
where $\mathbf{x}$ is a $k$-dimensional vector of covariates (including
$1$ as first element) and
$\boldsymbol \beta(p) = [\beta_{0}(p), \beta_{1}(p),$
$\ldots, \beta_{k-1}(p)]^{\top}$ is a vector of coefficients. The slopes
$\beta_{j}(p)$, $j = 1,\ldots, k-1$, have the usual interpretation of
partial derivatives. For example, in case of the simple model
$Q_{Y|X}(p) = \beta_{0}(p) + \beta_{1}(p)x$, one obtains
$$\frac{\partial Q_{Y|X}(p)}{\partial x} =  \beta_{1}(p).\\
$$
If $x$ is a dummy variable, then
$\beta_{1}(p) = Q_{Y|X = 1}(p) - Q_{Y|X=0}(p)$, i.e. the so-called
quantile treatment effect [@doksum; @lehmann; @koenker_xiao]. Estimation
can be carried out using LP algorithms which, given a sample
$(\mathbf{x}_{i},y_{i})$, $i=1,\dots,n$, solve
$$\min_{b \in \mathbb{R}^{k}} \sum_{i=1}^{n} \kappa_{p}\left(y_{i} - \mathbf{x}_{i}^{\top}\mathbf{b}\right),$$
where $\kappa_{p}(u) = u(p - I(u < 0))$, $0 < p < 1$, is the check loss
function. Large-$n$ approximation of standard errors can be obtained
from the sampling distribution of the linear quantile estimators
[@koenker_bassett_1978].

![Figure 3: (a) Waiting times between eruptions against durations of
eruptions (dashed vertical line drawn at $3$ minutes) in the Old
Faithful Geyser data set. (b) Mid-CDF of waiting time by duration of
eruption (solid line, shorter than 3 minutes; dashed line, longer than 3
minutes).](fig3.png){#fig:3 width="100%" alt="graphic without alt text"}

Waiting times between eruptions are plotted against the durations of the
eruptions in Figure [3](#fig:3). Two clusters of observations can be
defined for durations below and above 3 minutes [see also
@azzalini_bowman_1990]. The distribution shows a strong bimodality as
already illustrated in Figure [2](#fig:2). A dummy variable for
durations equal to or longer than $3$ minutes is created to define the
two distributions and included as covariate $X$ in a model as the one
specified in (\@ref(eq:4)). The latter is then fitted to the Old
Faithful Geyser data using the function `rq()` in the package *quantreg*
for $p \in \{0.1, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 0.9\}$.

``` r
> require("quantreg")
> y <- faithful$waiting
> x <- as.numeric(faithful$eruptions >= 3)
> fit <- rq(formula = y ~ x, tau = c(0.1, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 0.9))
> fit


Call:
rq(formula = y ~ x, tau = c(0.1, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 0.9))

Coefficients:
            tau= 0.10 tau= 0.25 tau= 0.50 tau= 0.75 tau= 0.90
(Intercept)        47        50        54        59        63
x                  26        26        26        25        25

Degrees of freedom: 272 total; 270 residual
```

From the output above, it is quite evident that the distribution of
waiting times is shifted by an approximately constant amount at all
considered values of $p$. The location-shift hypothesis can be tested by
using the Khmaladze test. The null hypothesis is that two distributions,
say $F_{0}$ and $F_{1}$, differ by a pure location shift
[@koenker_xiao], that is
$$H_{0}: \, F^{-1}_{1}(p) = F^{-1}_{0}(p) + \delta_{0},$$
where $\delta_{0}$ is the quantile treatment effect, constant over $p$.
The location--scale-shift specification of the test considers
$$H_{0}: \, F^{-1}_{1}(p) = \delta_{1}F^{-1}_{0}(p) + \delta_{0}.$$
The alternative hypothesis is that the model is more complex than the
one specified in the null hypothesis. The Khmaladze test is implemented
in *quantreg* (see `?quantreg::KhmaladzeTest` for further details). The
critical values of the test and corresponding significance levels
[@koenker_2005] are not readily available in the same package. These
have been hardcoded in the *Qtools* function `KhmaladzeFormat()` which
can be applied to `"KhmaladzeTest"` objects. For the Old Faithful Geyser
data, the result of the test is not statistically significant at the
$10\%$ level.

``` r
> kt <- KhmaladzeTest(formula = y ~ x, taus = seq(.05, .95, by = .01),
> KhmaladzeFormat(kt, 0.05)

Khmaladze test for the location-shift hypothesis
Joint test is not significant at 10% level
Test(s) for individual slopes:
 not significant at 10% level
```

## Goodness of fit

Distribution-free quantile regression does not require introducing an
assumption on the functional form of the error distribution
[@koenker_bassett_1978], but only weaker quantile restrictions
[@powell_1994]. Comparatively, the linear specification of the
conditional quantile function in Equation \@ref(eq:4) is a much stronger
assumption and thus plays an important role for inferential purposes.

The problem of assessing the goodness of fit (GOF) is rather neglected
in applications of QR. Although some approaches to GOF have been
proposed
[@zheng_1998; @koenker_machado_1999; @he_zhu_2003; @khmaladze_etal_2004],
there is currently a shortage of software code available to users. The
function `GOFTest()` implements a test based on the cusum process of the
gradient vector [@he_zhu_2003]. Briefly, the test statistic is given by
the largest eigenvalue of
$$n^{-1}\sum_{i}^{n} \mathbf{R}_{n}(\mathbf{x}_{i})\mathbf{R}^{\top}_{n}(\mathbf{x}_{i})$$
where
$\mathbf{R}_{n}(\mathbf{t}) = n^{-1/2} \sum_{j=1}^{n} \psi_{p}(r_{j})\mathbf{x}_{j} I(\mathbf{x}_{j} \leq \mathbf{t})$
is the residual cusum (RC) process and $\psi_{p}(r_{j})$ is the
derivative of the loss function $\kappa_{p}$ calculated for residual
$r_{j} = y_{j} - \mathbf{x}_{j}^{\top}\boldsymbol \beta(p)$. The
sampling distribution of this test statistic is non-normal
[@he_zhu_2003] and a resampling approach is used to obtain the $p$-value
under the null hypothesis.

An example is provided further below using the New York Air Quality data
set, which contains $111$ complete observations on daily mean ozone
(parts per billion -- ppb) and solar radiation (Langleys -- Ly). For
simplicity, wind speed and maximum daily temperature, also included in
the data set, are not analysed here.

Suppose that the model of interest is
$$\label{eq:5}
Q_{\text{ozone}}(p) = \beta_{0}(p) + \beta_{1}(p) \cdot \text{Solar.R}.   (\#eq:5)$$
Three conditional quantiles ($p \in \{0.1,0.5,0.9\}$) are estimated and
plotted using the following code:

``` r
> dd <- airquality[complete.cases(airquality), ]
> dd <- dd[order(dd$Solar.R), ]
> fit.rq <- rq(Ozone ~ Solar.R, tau = c(.1, .5, .9), data = dd)
> x <- seq(min(dd$Solar.R), max(dd$Solar.R), length = 200)
> yhat <- predict(fit.rq, newdata = data.frame(Solar.R = x))
> plot(Ozone ~ Solar.R, data = dd)
> apply(yhat, 2, function(y, x) lines(x, y), x = x)
```

![Figure 4: Predicted 10th (solid line), 50th (dashed line), and 90th
(dot-dashed line) centiles of ozone conditional on solar radiation in
the New York Air Quality data set.](fig4.png){#fig:4 width="100%" alt="graphic without alt text"}

As a function of solar radiation, the median of the ozone daily averages
increases by $0.09$ ppb for each Ly increase in solar radiation
(Figure [4](#fig:4)). The 90th centile of conditional ozone shows a
steeper slope at $0.39$ ppb/Ly, about nine times larger than the slope
of the conditional $10$th centile at $0.04$ ppb/Ly.

The RC test applied to the the object `fit.rq` provides evidence of lack
of fit for all quantiles considered, particularly for $p = 0.1$ and
$p = 0.5$. Therefore the straight-line model in Equation \@ref(eq:5) for
these three conditional quantiles does not seem to be appropriate. The
New York Air Quality data set will be analysed again in the next
section, where a transformation-based approach to nonlinear modelling is

## Transformation models

Complex dynamics may result in nonlinear effects in the relationship
between the covariates and the response variable. For instance, in
kinesiology, pharmacokinetics, and enzyme kinetics, the study of the
dynamics of an agent in a system involves the estimation of nonlinear
models; phenomena like human growth, certain disease mechanisms and the
effects of harmful environmental substances such as lead and mercury,
may show strong nonlinearities over time. In this section, the linear
model is abandoned in favor of a more general model of the type
$$\label{eq:6}
Q_{Y|X}(p) = g\left\{\mathbf{x}^{\top}\boldsymbol \beta(p)\right\},   (\#eq:6)$$
for some real-valued function $g$. If $g$ is nonlinear, the alternative
approaches to conditional quantile modelling are

Nonlinear parametric models

:   which may provide substantive interpretability, possibly
    parsimonious (in general more parsimonious than polynomials), and
    valid beyond the observed range of the data. A nonlinear model
    depends on either prior knowledge of the phenomenon or the
    introduction of new, strong theory to explain the observed
    relationship with potential predictive power. Estimation may present
    challenges;

Polynomial models and smoothing splines

:   falling under the label of nonparametric regression, in which the
    complexity of the model is approximated by a sequence of locally
    linear polynomials (a naïve global polynomial trend can be
    considered to be a special case). A nonparametric model need not
    introducing strong assumptions about the relationship and is
    essentially data-driven. Estimation is based on linear
    approximations and, typically, requires the introduction of a
    penalty term to control the degree of smoothing; and

Transformation models

:   a flexible, parsimonious family of parametric transformations is
    applied to the response seeking to obtain approximate linearity on
    the transformed scale. The data provide information about the "best"
    transformation among a family of transformations. Estimation is
    facilitated by the application of methods for linear models.

The focus of this section is on the third approach. More specifically
the functions available in *Qtools* refer to the methods for
transformation-based QR models developed by [@powell_1991],
[@chamberlain_1994], [@mu_he], [@dehbi_etal] and [@geraci_jones_2015].
Examples of approaches to nonlinear QR based on parametric models or
splines can be found in [@koenker_park_1996] and [@yu_jones],
respectively.

The goal of the transformation-based QR is to fit the model
$$\label{eq:7}
Q_{h\left(Y;\lambda_{p}\right)}(p) = \mathbf{x}^{\top}\boldsymbol \beta(p).   (\#eq:7)$$
The assumption is that the transformation $h$ is the inverse of $g$,
$h\left(Y; \lambda_{p}\right) \equiv g^{-1}(Y)$, so that the $p$th
quantile function of the transformed response variable is linear. (In
practice, it is satisfactory to achieve approximate linearity.) The
parameter $\lambda_{p}$ is a low-dimensional parameter that gives some
flexibility to the shape of the transformation and is estimated from the
data. In general, the interest is on predicting $Q_{Y|X}(p)$ and
estimating the effects of the covariates on $Q_{Y|X}(p)$. If $h$ is a
non-decreasing function on $\mathbb{R}$ (as is the case for all
transformations considered here), predictions can be easily obtained
from (\@ref(eq:7)) by virtue of the equivariance property of quantiles,
$$\label{eq:8}
Q_{Y|X}(p) = h^{-1}\left\{\mathbf{x}^{\top}\boldsymbol \beta(p); \lambda_{p}\right\}.   (\#eq:8)$$
The marginal effect of the $j$th covariate $x_{j}$ can be obtained by
differentiating the quantile function $Q_{Y|X}(p)$ with respect to
$x_{j}$. This can be written as the derivative of the composition
$Q \circ \eta$, i.e. 
$$\label{eq:9}
\frac{\partial Q(p)}{\partial x_{j}} = \frac{\partial Q(p)}{\partial \eta(p)} \cdot \frac{\partial \eta(p)}{\partial x_{j}},   (\#eq:9)$$
$\eta(p) = \mathbf{x}^{\top}\boldsymbol \beta(p)$. Once the estimates
$\hat{\boldsymbol{\beta}}(p)$ and $\hat{\lambda}_{p}$ are obtained,
these can be plugged in Equations \@ref(eq:8) and \@ref(eq:9).

The package *Qtools* provides several transformation families, namely
the Box--Cox [@box_cox], Aranda-Ordaz [@aranda_1981], and Jones
[@jones_2007; @geraci_jones_2015] transformations. A distinction between
these families is made in terms of the support of the response variable
to which the transformation is applied and the number of transformation
parameters. The Box--Cox model is a one-parameter family of
transformations which applies to singly bounded variables, $y > 0$. The
Aranda-Ordaz symmetric and asymmetric transformations too have one
parameter and are used when responses are bounded on the unit interval,
$0 < y < 1$ (doubly bounded). [@geraci_jones_2015] developed two
families of transformations which can be applied to either singly or
doubly bounded responses:

Proposal I transformations

:   with one parameter and assuming both symmetric and asymmetric forms;

Proposal II transformations

:   with two parameters, with one parameter modelling the symmetry (or
    lack thereof) of the transformation.

Originally, [@box_cox] proposed using power transformations to address
lack of linearity, homoscedasticity and normality of the residuals in
mean regression modelling. @sakia ([-@sakia p.175]) reported that
"seldom does this transformation fulfil the basic assumptions of
linearity, normality and homoscedasticity simultaneously as originally
suggested by Box & Cox (1964). The Box-Cox transformation has found more
practical utility in the empirical determination of functional
relationships in a variety of fields, especially in econometrics".

Indeed, the practical utility of power transformations has been long
recognised in QR modelling
[@powell_1991; @buchinsky_1995; @chamberlain_1994; @mu_he].
Model \@ref(eq:7) is the Box--Cox QR model if
$$\label{eq:10}
h_{BC}\left(Y;\lambda_{p}\right) =
\begin{cases}
 \dfrac{Y^{\lambda_{p}} - 1}{\lambda_{p}} & \text{if $\lambda_{p}
\neq 0$}\\[.5cm]
\log Y & \text{if $\lambda_{p} = 0$}.
\end{cases}   (\#eq:10)$$
Note that when $\lambda_{p} \neq 0$, the range of this transformation is
not $\mathbb{R}$ but the singly bounded interval
$\left(-1/\lambda_{p},\infty\right)$. This implies that the inversion in
(\@ref(eq:8)) is defined only for
$\lambda_{p} \mathbf{x}^{\top}\boldsymbol \beta(p) + 1 > 0$.

The symmetric Aranda-Ordaz transformation is given by
$$\label{eq:11}
h_{AOs}\left(Y;\lambda_{p}\right) =
\begin{cases}
\dfrac{2}{\lambda_{p}} \quad \dfrac{Y^{\lambda_{p}} -
\left(1-Y\right)^{\lambda_{p}}}{Y^{\lambda_{p}}  +
\left(1-Y\right)^{\lambda_{p}}}& \text{if  $\lambda_{p} \neq
0$},\\[.5cm]
\log\left(\dfrac{Y}{1-Y}\right) & \text{if $\lambda_{p} =
0$}.
\end{cases}   (\#eq:11)$$
(The symmetry here is that
$h_{AOs}\left(\theta;\lambda_p\right) = -h_{AOs}\left(1-\theta;\lambda_p\right)=h_{AOs}\left(\theta;-\lambda_p\right)$.)
There is a range problem with this transformation too since, for all
$\lambda_p \neq 0$, the range of $h_{AOs}$ is not $\mathbb{R}$, but
$\left(-2/|\lambda_{p}|, 2/|\lambda_{p}|\right)$. The asymmetric
Aranda-Ordaz transformation is given by
$$\label{eq:12}
h_{AOa}\left(Y;\lambda_{p}\right) =
\begin{cases}
\log \left\{\dfrac{\left(1-Y\right)^{-\lambda_{p}} -
1}{\lambda_{p}} \right\}& \text{if $\lambda_{p} \neq 0$},\\[.5cm]
\log \left\{-\log\left(1 - Y\right)\right\} & \text{if
$\lambda_{p} = 0$}.
\end{cases}   (\#eq:12)$$
For $\lambda_{p} = 0$, this is equivalent to the complementary log-log.
The asymmetric Aranda-Ordaz transformation does have range $\mathbb{R}$.
Note that $h_{AOa}(Y;1) = \log (Y/(1-Y))$, i.e. the transformation is
symmetric.

To overcome range problems, which give rise to computational
difficulties, [@geraci_jones_2015] proposed to use instead one-parameter
transformations with range $\mathbb{R}$. Proposal I is written in terms
of the variable (say) $W$, where
$$\label{eq:13}
h_I\left(W;\lambda_{p}\right) =
\begin{cases}
\dfrac{1}{2\lambda_{p}}\left(W^{\lambda_{p}} -
\dfrac{1}{W^{\lambda_{p}}}\right)& \text{if $\lambda_{p} \neq
0$}\\[.5cm]
\log W & \text{if $\lambda_{p} = 0$},
\end{cases}   (\#eq:13)$$
which takes on four forms depending on the relationship of $W$ to $Y$,
as described in Table [2](#tab:2). For each of domains $(0,\infty)$ and
$(0,1)$, there are symmetric and asymmetric forms.

:::

Since the transformation in (\@ref(eq:13)) has range $\mathbb{R}$ for
all $\lambda_{p}$, it admits an explicit inverse transformation. In
addition, in the case of a single covariate, every estimated quantile
that results will be monotone increasing, decreasing or constant,
although different estimated quantiles can have different shapes from
this collection. [@geraci_jones_2015] also proposed a transformation
that unifies the symmetric and asymmetric versions of $h_{I}$ into a
single two-parameter transformation, namely
$$\label{eq:14}
h_{II}\left(W;\lambda_p\right) = h_I\left(W_{\delta_p};\lambda_p\right),   (\#eq:14)$$
where $h_I$ is given in (\@ref(eq:13)) and
$$W_{\delta_{p}} = h_{BC}\left(1+W;\delta_p\right) =
\begin{cases}
 \dfrac{(1+W)^{\delta_{p}} - 1}{\delta_{p}} & \text{if $\delta_{p} > 0$}\\[.5cm]
\log (1+W) & \text{if $\delta_{p} = 0$},
\end{cases}$$
with $W=Y$, if $Y > 0$, and $W=Y/(1-Y)$, if $Y \in (0,1)$. The
additional parameter $\delta_{p}$ controls the asymmetry: symmetric
forms of $h_{I}$ correspond to $\delta_p = 1$ while asymmetric forms of
$h_{I}$ to $\delta_p = 0$.

All transformation models discussed above can be fitted using a
two-stage (TS) estimator [@chamberlain_1994; @buchinsky_1995] whereby
$\boldsymbol \beta(p)$ is estimated conditionally on a fine grid of
values for the transformation parameter(s). Alternatively, point
estimation can be approached using the RC process [@mu_he], which is
akin to the process that leads to the RC test introduced in the previous
section. The RC estimator avoids the troublesome inversion of the
Box-Cox and Aranda-Ordaz transformations, but it is computationally more
intensive than the TS estimator.

There are several methods for interval estimation, including those based
on large-$n$ approximations and the ubiquitous bootstrap. Both the TS
and RC estimators have an asymptotic normal distribution. The
large-sample properties of the TS estimator for monotonic quantile
regression models have been studied by [@powell_1991] [see also
@chamberlain_1994; @machado_mata]. Under regularity conditions, it can
be shown that the TS estimator is unbiased and will converge to a normal
distribution with a sandwich-type limiting covariance matrix which is
easy to calculate. In contrast, the form of the covariance matrix of the
sampling distribution for the RC estimator is rather complicated and its
estimation requires resampling [@mu_he]. Finally, if the transformation
parameter is assumed to be known, then conditional inference is
apposite. In this case, the estimation procedures simplify to those for
standard quantile regression problems.

In *Qtools*, model fitting for one-parameter transformation models can
be carried out using the function `tsrq()`. The `formula` argument
specifies the model for the linear predictor as in (\@ref(eq:7)), while
the argument `tsf` provides the desired transformation $h$ as specified
in Equations \@ref(eq:10)-\@ref(eq:13): `"bc"` for the Box--Cox model,
`"ao"` for Aranda-Ordaz families, and `"mcjI"` for proposal I
transformations. Additional arguments in the function `tsrq()` include

`symmetry`

:   a logical flag to specify the symmetric or asymmetric version of
    `"ao"` and `"mcjI"`;

`dbounded`

:   a logical flag to specify whether the response variable is doubly
    bounded (default is strictly positive, i.e. singly bounded);

`lambda`

:   a numerical vector to define the grid of values for estimating
    $\lambda_p$; and `conditional`, a logical flag indicating whether
    $\lambda_{p}$ is assumed to be known (in which case the argument
    `lambda` provides such known value).

There are other functions to fit transformation models. The function
`rcrq()` fits one-parameter transformation models using the RC
estimator. The functions `tsrq2()` and `nlrq2()` are specific to
@geraci_jones_2015's ([-@geraci_jones_2015]) Proposal II
transformations. The former employs a two-way grid search while the
latter is based on Nelder-Mead optimization as implemented in `optim()`.
Simulation studies in [@geraci_jones_2015] suggest that, although
computationally slower, a two grid search is numerically more stable
than the derivative-free approach.

A summary of the basic differences between all fitting functions is
given in Table [3](#tab:3). The table also shows the available methods
in `summary.rqt()` to estimate standard errors and confidence intervals
for the model's parameters. Unconditional inference is carried out
jointly on $\boldsymbol \beta(p)$ and the transformation parameter by
means of bootstrap using the package
[*boot*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=boot)
[@boot; @davison_hinkley]. Large-$n$ approximations
[@powell_1991; @chamberlain_1994; @machado_mata] are also available for
the one-parameter TS estimator under iid or nid assumptions.

When `summary.rqt()` is executed with the argument `conditional = TRUE`,
confidence interval estimation for $\boldsymbol \beta_{p}$ is performed
with one of the several methods developed for linear quantile regression
estimators [@koenker_2005 p.110] (see options `"rank"`, `"iid"`,
`"nid"`, `"ker"`, and `"boot"` in `quantreg::summary.rq()`).

In the New York Air Quality data example, a linear model was found
unsuitable to describe the relationship between ozone and solar
radiation. At closer inspection, Figure [4](#fig:4) reveals that the
conditional distribution of ozone may in fact be nonlinearly associated
with solar radiation, at least for some of the conditional quantiles.
The model
$$\label{eq:15}
Q_{h_{Is}\{\text{ozone}\}}(p) = \beta_{0}(p) + \beta_{1}(p) \cdot \text{Solar.R},   (\#eq:15)$$
where $h_{Is}$ denotes the symmetric version of (\@ref(eq:13)) for a
singly bounded response variable, is fitted for the quantiles
$p \in \{0.1,0.5,0.9\}$ using the following code:

``` r
> system.time(fit.rqt <- tsrq(Ozone ~ Solar.R, data = dd, tsf = "mcjI",
+    symm = TRUE, dbounded = FALSE, lambda = seq(1, 3, by = 0.005),
+    conditional = FALSE, tau = c(.1, .5, .9)))
   user  system elapsed
    0.5     0.0     0.5

tsrq(formula = Ozone ~ Solar.R, data = dd, tsf = "mcjI", symm = TRUE,
    dbounded = FALSE, lambda = seq(1, 3, by = 0.005), conditional = FALSE,
    tau = c(0.1, 0.5, 0.9))

Proposal I symmetric transformation (singly bounded response)

Optimal transformation parameter:
tau = 0.1 tau = 0.5 tau = 0.9
    2.210     2.475     1.500

Coefficients linear model (transformed scale):
             tau = 0.1  tau = 0.5 tau = 0.9

Degrees of freedom: 111 total; 109 residual
```

The TS estimator makes a search for $\lambda_{p}$ over the grid
$1.000, 1.005, \ldots, 2.995, 3.000$. The choice of the search interval
usually results from a compromise between accuracy and performance: the
coarser the grid, the faster the computation but the less accurate the
estimate. A reasonable approach would be to start with a coarse,
wide-ranging grid (e.g. `seq(-5, 5, by = 0.5)`), then center the
interval about the resulting estimate using a finer grid, and re-fit the
model.

The output above reports the estimates $\boldsymbol{\hat{\beta}}(p)$ and
$\hat{\lambda}_p$ for each quantile level specified in `tau`. Here, the
quantities of interest are the predictions on the ozone scale and the
marginal effect of solar radiation, which can obtained using the
function `predict.rqt()`.

``` r
> x <- seq(9, 334, length = 200)
> qhat <- predict(fit.rqt, newdata = data.frame(Solar.R = x),
+    type = "response")
> dqhat <- predict(fit.rqt, newdata = data.frame(Solar.R = x),
+    type = "maref", namevec = "Solar.R")
The linear component of the marginal effect is calculated as derivative of
 Ozone ~ beta1 * Solar.R
 with respect to Solar.R
```

The calculations above are based on a sequence of 200 ozone values in
the interval $[9,334]$ Ly, as provided via the argument `newdata` (if
this argument is missing, the function returns the fitted values). There
are three types of predictions available:

`link`

:   predictions of conditional quantiles on the transformed scale
    (\@ref(eq:7)),
    i.e. $\hat{Q}_{h\left(Y;\hat{\lambda}_{p}\right)}(p) = \mathbf{x}^{T}\hat{\boldsymbol{\beta}}(p)$;

`response`

:   predictions of conditional quantiles on the original scale
    (\@ref(eq:8)),
    i.e. $\hat{Q}_{Y|X}(p) = \\ h^{-1}\left\{\mathbf{x}^{\top}\hat{\boldsymbol{\beta}}(p); \hat{\lambda}_{p}\right\}$;
    and

`maref`

:   predictions of the marginal effect (\@ref(eq:9)).

In the latter case, the argument `namevec` is used to specify the name
of the covariate with respect to which the marginal effect has to be
calculated. The function `maref.rqt()` computes derivatives symbolically
using the *stats* function `deriv()` and these are subsequently
evaluated numerically. While the nonlinear component of the marginal
effect in Equation \@ref(eq:9) (i.e. $\partial Q(p)/\partial \eta(p)$)
is rather straightforward to derive for any of the transformations
(\@ref(eq:10))-(\@ref(eq:13)), the derivative of the linear predictor
(i.e. $\partial \eta(p)/\partial x_{j}$) requires parsing the `formula`
argument in order to obtain an expression suitable for `deriv()`. The
function `maref.rqt()` can handle simple expressions with common
functions like `log()`, `exp()`, etc. , interaction terms, and `"AsIs"`
terms (i.e. `I()`). However, using functions that are not recognised by
`deriv()` will trigger an error.

set.](fig5.png){#fig:5 width="100%" alt="graphic without alt text"}

The predicted quantiles of ozone and the marginal effects of solar
radiation are plotted in Figure [5](#fig:5) using the following code:

``` r
> par(mfrow = c(1, 2))
> plot(Ozone ~ Solar.R, data = dd, xlab = "Solar radiation (lang)",
+    ylab = "Ozone (ppb)")
> for(i in 1:3) lines(x, qhat[ ,i], lty = c(1, 2, 4)[i], lwd = 2)
> plot(range(x), range(dqhat), type = "n", xlab = "Solar radiation (lang)",
+    ylab = "Marginal effect")
> for(i in 1:3) lines(x, dqhat[ ,i], lty = c(1, 2, 4)[i], lwd = 2)
```

The effect of solar radiation on different quantiles of ozone levels
shows a nonlinear behavior, especially at lower ranges of radiation
(below $50$ Ly) and on the median ozone. It might be worth testing the
goodness-of-fit of the model. In the previous analysis, it was found
evidence of lack of fit for the linear specification (\@ref(eq:5)). In
contrast, the output reported below indicates that, in general, the
goodness of fit of the quantile models based on the transformation model
(\@ref(eq:15)) has improved since the test statistics are now smaller at
all values of $p$. However, such improvement is not yet satisfactory for
the median.

Quantile 0.9: Test statistic = 0.0212; p-value = 0.127
```

The TS and RC estimators generally provide similar estimates and
predictions. However, computation based on the cusum process tends to be
somewhat slow, as shown further below. This is also true for the RC test
provided by `GOFTest()`.

``` r
> system.time(fit.rqt <- rcrq(Ozone ~ Solar.R, data = dd, tsf = "mcjI",

An example using doubly bounded transformations is demonstrated using
the A-level Chemistry Scores data set. The latter is available from
*Qtools* and it consists of 31022 observations of A-level scores in
Chemistry for England and Wales students, 1997. The data set also
includes information of prior academic achievement as assessed with
General Certificate of Secondary Education (GCSE) average scores. The
goal is to evaluate the ability of GCSE to predict A-level scores. The
latter are based on national exams in specific subjects (e.g. chemistry)
with grades ranging from A to F. For practical purposes, scores are
converted numerically as follows: A = 10, B = 8, C = 6, D = 4, E = 2,
and F = 0. The response is therefore doubly bounded between 0 ad 10. It
should be noted that this variable is discrete, although, for the sake
of simplicity, here it is assumed that the underlying process is
continuous.

The model considered here is
$$\label{eq:16}
Q_{h_{AOa}\{\text{score}\}}(p) = \beta_{0}(p) + \beta_{1}(p) \cdot \text{gcse},   (\#eq:16)$$
where $h_{AOa}$ denotes the asymmetric Aranda-Ordaz transformation in
(\@ref(eq:12)). This model is fitted for $p = 0.9$:

``` r
> data(Chemistry)
> fit.rqt <- tsrq(score ~ gcse, data = Chemistry, tsf = "ao", symm = FALSE,
+    lambda = seq(0, 2, by = 0.01), tau = 0.9)
```

![Figure 6: Predicted 90th centile of A-level scores conditional on GCSE
scores (a) and corresponding estimated marginal effect (b) using the
asymmetric Aranda-Ordaz transformation in the A-level Chemistry Scores
data set.](fig6.png){#fig:6 width="100%" alt="graphic without alt text"}

The predicted $90$th centile of A-level scores conditional on GCSE and
the marginal effect of GCSE are plotted in Figure [6](#fig:6). There is
clearly a positive, nonlinear association between the two scores. The
nonlinearity is partly explained by the floor and ceiling effects which
result from the boundedness of the measurement scale. Note, however,
that the S-shaped curve is not symmetric about the inflection point. As
a consequence, the marginal effect is skewed to the left. Indeed, the
estimate $\hat{\lambda}_{0.9} = 0$ and the narrow confidence interval
give support to a complementary log-log transformation:

Alternatively, one can estimate the parameter $\delta_{p}$ using a
two-parameter transformation:

``` r
> coef(tsrq2(score ~ gcse, data = chemsub, dbounded = TRUE,
+    lambda = seq(0, 2, by = 0.1), delta = seq(0, 2, by = 0.1),
+    tau = 0.9), all = TRUE)

(Intercept)        gcse      lambda       delta
 -4.1442274   0.8681246   0.0000000   0.0000000
```

These results confirm the asymmetric nature of the relationship since
$\hat{\delta}_{0.9} = 0$. Similar results (not shown) were obtained with
`nlrq2()`.

In conclusion, the package *Qtools* offers several options in terms of
transformations and estimation algorithms, the advantages and
disadvantages of which are discussed by [@geraci_jones_2015]. In
particular, they found that the symmetric Proposal I transformation
improves considerably on the Box-Cox method and marginally on the
Aranda-Ordaz transformation in terms of mean squared error of the
predictions. Also, asymmetric transformations do not seem to improve
sufficiently often on symmetric transformations to be especially
recommendable. However, the Box-Cox and the symmetric Aranda-Ordaz
transformations should not be used when individual out-of-range
predictions represent a potential inconvenience as, for example, in
multiple imputation (see section further below). Finally, in some
situations transformation-based quantile regression may be competitive
as compared to methods based on smoothing, as demonstrated by a recent
application to anthropometric charts [@boghossian_etal].

## Conditional LSS

Quantile-based measures of location, scale, and shape can be assessed
*conditionally* on covariates. A simple approach is to a fit a linear
model as in (\@ref(eq:4)) or a transformation-based model as in
(\@ref(eq:7)), and then predict $\hat{Q}_{Y|X}(p)$ to obtain the
conditional LSS measures in Equation \@ref(eq:3) for specific values of
$\mathbf{x}$.

Estimation of conditional LSS can be carried out by using the function
`qlss.formula()`. The conditional model is specified in the argument
`formula`, while the probability $p$ is given in `probs`. (As seen in
Equation \@ref(eq:3), the other probabilities of interest to obtain the
decomposition of the conditional quantiles are $1-p$, $0.25$, $0.5$, and
$0.75$.) The argument `type` specifies the required type of regression
model, more specifically `"rq"` for linear models and `"rqt"` for
transformation-based models. The function `qlss.formula()` will take any
additional argument to be passed to `quantreg::rq()` or `tsrq()`
(e.g. `subset`, `weights`, etc. ).

Let's consider the New York Air Quality data example discussed in the
previous section and assume that the transformation model (\@ref(eq:15))
holds for the quantiles $p \in \{0.05, 0.1, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75,$
$0.9, 0.95\}$. Then the conditional LSS summary of the distribution of
ozone conditional on solar radiation for $p = 0.05$ and $p = 0.1$ is
calculated as follows:

``` r
> fit.qlss <- qlss(formula = Ozone ~ Solar.R, data = airquality, type =
+    "rqt", tsf = "mcjI", symm = TRUE, dbounded = FALSE,  lambda =
+    seq(1, 3, by = 0.005), probs = c(0.05, 0.1))
> fit.qlss

call:
qlss.formula(formula = Ozone ~ Solar.R, probs = c(0.05, 0.1),
    data = airquality, type = "rqt", tsf = "mcjI", symm = TRUE,
    dbounded = FALSE, lambda = seq(1, 3, by = 0.005))

Conditional Quantile-Based Location, Scale, and Shape
-- Values are averaged over observations --

** Location **
Median
[1] 30.2258
** Scale **
Inter-quartile range (IQR)
[1] 43.40648
Inter-quantile range (IPR)
    0.05      0.1
88.02909 73.93430
**Shape**
Skewness index
     0.05       0.1
0.5497365 0.5180108
Shape index
    0.05      0.1
1.960315 1.661648
```

The output, which is of class `"qlss"`, is a named list with the same
LSS measures seen in the case of unconditional quantiles. However, these
are now conditional on solar radiation. By default, the predictions are
the fitted values, which are averaged over observations for printing
purposes. An optional data frame for predictions can be given via the
argument `newdata` in `predict.qlss()`. If `interval = TRUE`, the latter
computes confidence intervals at the specified `level` using `R`
bootstrap replications (it is, therefore, advisable to set the seed
before calling `predict.qlss()`). The conditional LSS measures can be
conveniently plotted using the `plot.qlss()` function as shown in the
code below. The argument `z` is required and specifies the covariate
used for plotting. Finally, the argument `whichp` specifies one
probability (and one only) among those given in `probs` that should be
used for plotting (e.g. $p = 0.1$ in the following example).

``` r
> set.seed(567)
> x <- seq(9, 334, length = 200)
> qhat <- predict(fit.qlss, newdata = data.frame(Solar.R = x),
+    interval = TRUE, level = 0.90, R = 500)
> plot(qhat, z = x, whichp = 0.1, interval = TRUE, type = "l",
+    xlab = "Solar radiation (lang)", lwd = 2)
```

Figure [7](#fig:7) shows that both the median and the IQR of ozone
increase nonlinearly with increasing solar radiation. The distribution
of ozone is skewed to the right and the degree of asymmetry is highest
at low values of solar radiation. This is due to the extreme curvature
of the median which takes on values close to the $10$th centile
(Figure [5](#fig:5)). (Recall that the index approaches 1 when
$Q(p) \approx Q(0.5)$.) However, the sparsity of observations at the
lower end of the observed range of solar radiation determines
substantial uncertainty as reflected by the wider confidence interval
(Figure [7](#fig:7)). At $p = 0.1$, the conditional shape index is on
average equal to $1.66$ and it increases monotonically from $1.32$ to
about $1.85$, remaining always below the tail-weight threshold of a
normal distribution ($1.90$).

## Restricted quantile regression

Besides a loss of precision, high sparsity (low density) might also lead
to a violation of the basic property of monotonicity of quantile
functions. Quantile crossing occurs when
$\mathbf{x}_{i}^{\top}\hat{\boldsymbol \beta}(p) > \mathbf{x}_{i}^{\top}\hat{\boldsymbol \beta}(p')$
for some $\mathbf{x}_{i}$ and $p < p'$. This problem typically occurs in
the outlying regions of the design space [@koenker_2005] where also
sparsity occurs more frequently. Balanced designs with larger sample
sizes would then offer some assurance against quantile crossing,
provided, of course, that the QR models are correctly specified. Model
misspecification, indeed, can still be a cause of crossing of the
quantile curves. Restricted regression quantiles (RRQ) [@he_1997] might
offer a practical solution when little can be done in terms of
modelling. This approach applies to a subclass of linear models
$$Y = \mathbf{x}^{\top}\beta + \epsilon$$
and linear heteroscedastic models
$$Y = \mathbf{x}^{\top}\beta + \left(\mathbf{x}^{\top}\gamma\right)\,\epsilon,$$
where $\mathbf{x}^{\top}\gamma > 0$ and $\epsilon \sim F$. Basically, it
consists in fitting a reduced regression model passing through the
origin. The reader is referred to [@he_1997] for details. Here, it is
worth stressing that when the restriction does not hold, i.e. if the
model is more complex than a location--scale-shift model, then RRQ may
yield unsatisfactory results [@he_1997]. See also [@zhao_2000] for an
examination of the asymptotic properties of the restricted QR estimator.
In particular, the relative efficiency of RRQ as compared to RQ depends
on the error distribution. For some common unimodal distributions,
[@zhao_2000] showed that RRQ in iid models is more efficient than RQ.
This property is lost when the error is asymmetric. In contrast, the
efficiency of RRQ in heteroscedastic models is comparable to that of RQ
even for small samples.

![Figure 8: Predicted quantiles of number of bindings conditional on
esterase concentration using regression quantiles (a) and restricted
regression quantiles (b) in the Esterase data set.](fig8.png){#fig:8
width="100%" alt="graphic without alt text"}

The package *Qtools* provides the functions `rrq()`, `rrq.fit()` and
`rrq.wfit()` which are, respectively, the restricted analogs of `rq()`,
`rq.fit()`, and `rq.wfitv` in *quantreg*. S3 methods `print()`,
`coef()`, `predict()`, `fitted()`, `residuals()`, and `summary()` are
available for objects of class `"rrq"`. In particular, confidence
intervals are obtained using the functions `boot()` and `boot.ci()` from
package *boot*. Future versions of the package will develop the function
`summary.rrq()` to include asymptotic standard errors [@zhao_2000]. An
application is shown below using an example discussed by [@zhao_2000].
The data set, available from *Qtools*, consists of $118$ measurements of
esterase concentrations and number of bindings counted in binding
experiments.

``` r
> data("esterase")
> taus <- c(.1, .25, .5, .75, .9)
> fit.rq <- rq(Count ~ Esterase, data = esterase, tau = taus)
> yhat1 <- fitted(fit.rq)
> fit.rrq <- rrq(Count ~ Esterase, data = esterase, tau = taus)
> yhat2 <- fitted(fit.rrq)
```

The predicted $90$th centile curve crosses the $50$th and $75$th curves
at lower esterase concentrations (Figure [8](#fig:8)). The crossing is
removed in predictions based on RRQs.

As discussed above, the reliability of the results depends on the
validity of the restriction carried by RRQ. A quick check can be
performed using the location--scale-shift specification of the Khmaladze
test.

``` r
> kt <- KhmaladzeTest(formula = Count ~ Esterase, data = esterase,
+ taus = seq(.05,.95,by = .01), nullH = "location-scale")
> KhmaladzeFormat(kt, 0.05)

Khmaladze test for the location-shift hypothesis
Joint test is not significant at 10% level
Test(s) for individual slopes:
 not significant at 10% level
```

The quantile crossing problem can be approached also by directly
rearranging the fitted values $\hat{Q}_{Y|X = \mathbf{x}}(p)$ to obtain
monotone (in $p$) predictions for each $\mathbf{x}$
[@chernozhukov_etal]. This method is implemented in the package
[*Rearrangement*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=Rearrangement)
[@rearrangement]. As compared to RRQ, this approach is more general as
it is not confined to, for example, location--scale-shift models
[@chernozhukov_etal]; however, in contrast to RRQ, it does not yield
estimates of parameters (e.g. slopes) of the model underlying the final
monotonised curves. Such estimates, available from `"rrq"` objects, may
be of practical utility when summarising the results.

## Conditional quantiles of discrete data

Modelling conditional functions of discrete data is less common and, on
a superficial level, might even appear as an unnecessary complication.
However, a deeper look at its rationale will reveal that a
distribution-free analysis can provide insightful information in the
discrete case as it does in the continuous case. Indeed, methods for
conditional quantiles of continuous distributions can be---and have
been---adapted to discrete responses.

The package *Qtools* offers some limited functionalities for count and
binary data. Further research is needed to develop the theory of QR for
discrete data and to improve computational algorithms. Therefore, the
user should use these functions with caution.

Let $Y$ be a count variable such as, for example, the number of car
accidents during a week or the number of times a patient visits their
doctor during a year. As usual, $X$ denotes a vector of covariates.
Poisson regression, which belongs to the family of generalised linear
models (GLMs), is a common choice for this kind of data, partly because
of its availability in many statistical packages. Symbolically,
$Y \sim \textrm{Pois}(\theta)$, where
$\theta \equiv \mathbb{E}(Y|X = \mathbf{x}) = h^{-1}\left(\mathbf{x}^{\top}\boldsymbol{\beta}\right)$
and $h$ is the logarithmic link function. Note that the variance also is
equal to $\theta$. Indeed, moments of order higher than $2$ governing
the shape of the distribution depend on the same parameter. Every
component of the conditional LSS in a Poisson model is therefore
controlled by $\theta$. If needed, more flexibility can be achieved
using a distribution-free approach.

[@machado_silva_2005] proposed the model
$$\label{eq:17}
Q_{h\left(Z;p\right)}(p) = \mathbf{x}^{\top}\boldsymbol \beta(p),   (\#eq:17)$$
where $Z = Y + U$ is obtained by jittering $Y$ with a $[0,1)$-uniform
noise $U$, independent of $Y$ and $X$. In principle, any monotone
transformation $h$ can be considered. Given the continuity between
counts induced by jittering, standard inference for linear quantile
functions [@koenker_bassett_1978] can be applied to fit (\@ref(eq:17)).
In practice, a sample of $M$ jittered responses $Z$ is taken to estimate
$\hat{\boldsymbol \beta}_{m}(p)$, $m = 1,\ldots,M$; the noise is then
averaged out,
$\hat{\boldsymbol \beta}(p) = \frac{1}{M} \sum_{m} \hat{\boldsymbol \beta}_{m}(p)$.

@machado_silva_2005's ([-@machado_silva_2005]) methods, including
large-$n$ approximations for standard errors, are implemented in the
function `rq.counts()`. The `formula` argument specifies a linear model
as in (\@ref(eq:17)), while the argument `tsf` provides the desired
transformation $h$. By default, this is the $\log$ transformation
(i.e. Box-Cox with parameter $\lambda_{p} = 0$) but other
transformations are allowed. Note that `GOFTest()` can be applied to
`"rq.counts"` objects as well.

*Qtools* provides functions for modelling binary responses as well.
First of all, it is useful to note that the classical GLM for a binary
response $Y \sim \mathrm{Bin}(1,\pi)$ establishes a relationship between
the probability $\Pr\left(Y = 1\right) = \pi$ and a set of predictors
$\mathbf{x}$. The application of QR to binary outcomes relies on the
continuous latent variable regression formulation
$$\label{eq:18}
Y^{*} = \mathbf{x}^{\top}\boldsymbol{\beta} + \epsilon   (\#eq:18)$$
and assumes that the binary observations are the result of the
dichotomization $Y = I\left(Y^{*} > 0\right)$, with $Y^{*}$ unobserved.

Maximum score estimation, originally developed by
[@manski_1975; @manski_1985], is equivalent to estimating the
conditional quantiles of the latent variable $Y^{*}$. However, the
optimization problem offers numerical challenges due to the the
piecewise linearity of the indicator function and the nonconvexity of
the loss function. The function `rq.bin()` is the main function to
obtain binary regression quantiles. It is a wrapper for the function
`rqbin.fit()` which calls Fortran code written for simulated annealing
estimation [@goffe_etal_1994]. *Qtools* offers a limited number of
functions for objects of class `"rq.bin"` including `coef()` and
`predict()`. These methods should be considered still experimental. In
particular, the user should be aware that the estimates obtained from
the fitting procedure may be sensitive to different settings of the
simulated annealing algorithm. The latter can be controlled using
`rqbinControl()`.

## Quantile-based multiple imputation

Regression models play an important role in conditional imputation of
missing values. QR can be used as an effective approach for multiple
imputation (MI) when location-shift models are inadequate
[@munoz_rueda_2009; @bottai_zhen_2013; @geraci_2016].

In *Qtools*, `mice.impute.rq()` and `mice.impute.rrq()` are auxiliary
functions written to be used along with the functions of the R package
[*mice*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=mice) [@mice]. The former is
based on the standard QR estimator (`rq.fit()`) while the latter on the
restricted counterpart (`rrq.fit()`). Both imputation functions allow
for the specification of the transformation-based QR models discussed
previously. The equivariance property is useful to achieve linearity of
the conditional model and to ensure that imputations lie within some
interval when imputed variables are bounded. An example is available
from the help file `?mice.impute.rq` using the `nhanes` data set. See
also [@geraci_2016] for a thorough description of these methods.

# Final remarks

Quantiles have long occupied an important place in statistics. The
package *Qtools* builds on recent methodological and computational
developments of quantile functions and related methods to promote their
application in statistical data modelling.
