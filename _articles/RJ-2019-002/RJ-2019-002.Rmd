title: Connecting R with D3 for dynamic graphics, to explore multivariate data with
  tours
abstract: The tourr package in R has several algorithms and displays for showing multivariate
  data as a sequence of low-dimensional projections. It can display as a movie but
  has no capacity for interaction, such as stop/go, change tour type, drop/add variables.
  The tourrGui package provides these sorts of controls, but the interface is programmed
  with the dated RGtk2 package. This work explores using custom messages to pass data
  from R to D3 for viewing, using the Shiny framework. This is an approach that can
  be generally used for creating all sorts of interactive graphics.
