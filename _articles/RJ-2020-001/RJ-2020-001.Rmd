title: 'Mapping Smoothed Spatial Effect Estimates from Individual-Level Data: MapGAM '
abstract: 'We introduce and illustrate the utility of MapGAM, a user-friendly R package
  that provides a unified framework for estimating, predicting and drawing inference
  on covariate-adjusted spatial effects using individual-level data. The package also
  facilitates visualization of spatial effects via automated mapping procedures. MapGAM
  estimates covariate-adjusted spatial associations with a univariate or survival
  outcome using generalized additive models that include a non-parametric bivariate
  smooth term of geolocation parameters. Estimation and mapping methods are implemented
  for continuous, discrete, and right-censored survival data. In the current manuscript,
  we summarize the methodology implemented in MapGAM and illustrate the package using
  two example simulated datasets: the first considering a case-control study design
  from the state of Massachusetts and the second considering right-censored survival
  data from California.'
