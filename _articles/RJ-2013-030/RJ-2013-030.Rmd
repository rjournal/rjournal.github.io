title: 'CompLognormal: An R Package for Composite Lognormal Distributions'
abstract: In recent years, composite models based on the lognormal distribution have
  become popular in actuarial sciences and related areas. In this short note, we present
  a new R package for computing the probability density function, cumulative density
  function, and quantile function, and for generating random numbers of any composite
  model based on the lognormal distribution. The use of the package is illustrated
  using a real data set.
