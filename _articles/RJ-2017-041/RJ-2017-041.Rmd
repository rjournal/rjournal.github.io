title: 'CRTgeeDR: an R Package for Doubly Robust Generalized Estimating Equations
  Estimations in Cluster Randomized Trials with Missing Data'
abstract: Semi-parametric approaches based on generalized estimating equations (GEE)
  are widely used to analyze correlated outcomes in longitudinal settings. In this
  paper, we present a package CRTgeeDR developed for cluster randomized trials with
  missing data (CRTs). For use of inverse probability weighting to adjust for missing
  data in cluster randomized trials, we show that other software lead to biased estimation
  for non-independence working correlation structure. CRTgeeDR solves this problem.
  We also extend the ability of existing packages to allow augmented Doubly Robust
  GEE estimation (DR). Simulation studies demonstrate the consistency of estimators
  implemented in CRTgeeDR compared to packages such as geepack and the gains associated
  with the use of the DR for analyzing a binary outcome using a logistic regression.
  Finally, we illustrate the method on data from a sanitation CRT in developing countries.
