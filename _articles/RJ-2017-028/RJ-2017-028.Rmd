title: 'checkmate: Fast Argument Checks for Defensive R Programming'
abstract: 'Dynamically typed programming languages like R allow programmers to write
  generic, flexible and concise code and to interact with the language using an interactive
  Read-eval-print-loop (REPL). However, this flexibility has its price: As the R interpreter
  has no information about the expected variable type, many base functions automatically
  convert the input instead of raising an exception. Unfortunately, this frequently
  leads to runtime errors deeper down the call stack which obfuscates the original
  problem and renders debugging challenging. Even worse, unwanted conver sions can
  remain undetected and skew or invalidate the results of a statistical analysis.
  As a resort, assertions can be employed to detect unexpected input during runtime
  and to signal understandable and traceable errors. The package checkmate provides
  a plethora of functions to check the type and related properties of the most frequently
  used R objects and variable types. The package is mostly written in C to avoid any
  unnecessary performance overhead. Thus, the programmer can conveniently write concise,
  well-tested assertions which outperforms custom R code for many applications. Fur
  thermore, checkmate simplifies writing unit tests using the framework testthat (Wickham,
  2011) by extending it with plenty of additional expectation functions, and registered
  C routines are available for package developers to perform assertions on arbitrary
  SEXPs (internal data structure for R objects implemented as struct in C) in compiled
  code.'
