title: 'checkmate: Fast Argument Checks for Defensive R Programming'
abstract: 'Dynamically typed programming languages like R allow programmers to write
  generic, flexible and concise code and to interact with the language using an interactive
  Read-eval-print-loop (REPL). However, this flexibility has its price: As the R interpreter
  has no information about the expected variable type, many base functions automatically
  convert the input instead of raising an exception. Unfortunately, this frequently
  leads to runtime errors deeper down the call stack which obfuscates the original
  problem and renders debugging challenging. Even worse, unwanted conversions can
  remain undetected and skew or invalidate the results of a statistical analysis.
  As a resort, assertions can be employed to detect unexpected input during runtime
  and to signal understandable and traceable errors. The package *checkmate* provides
  a plethora of functions to check the type and related properties of the most frequently
  used R objects and variable types. The package is mostly written in C to avoid any
  unnecessary performance overhead. Thus, the programmer can conveniently write concise,
  well-tested assertions which outperforms custom R code for many applications. Furthermore,
  *checkmate* simplifies writing unit tests using the framework *testthat* [@wickham_2011]
  by extending it with plenty of additional expectation functions, and registered
  C routines are available for package developers to perform assertions on arbitrary
  SEXPs (internal data structure for R objects implemented as struct in C) in compiled
  code.'

# Defensive programming in R {#sec:introduction}

Most dynamic languages utilize a weak type system where the type of
variable must not be declared, and R is no exception in this regard. On
the one hand, a weak type system generally reduces the code base and
encourages rapid prototyping of functions. On the other hand, in
comparison to strongly typed languages like C/C++, errors in the program
flow are much harder to detect. Without the type information, the R
interpreter just relies on the called functions to handle their input in
a meaningful way. Unfortunately, many of R's base functions are
implemented with the REPL in mind. Thus, instead of raising an
exception, many functions silently try to auto-convert the input. E.g.,
instead of assuming that the input `NULL` does not make sense for the
function `mean()`, the value `NA` of type numeric is returned and
additionally a warning message is signaled. While this behaviour is
acceptable for interactive REPL usage where the user can directly react
to the warning, it is highly unfavorable in packages or
non-interactively executed scripts. As the generated missing value is
passed to other functions deeper down the call stack, it will eventually
raise an error. However, the error will be reported in a different
context and associated with different functions and variable names. The
link to origin of the problem is missing and debugging becomes much more
challenging. Furthermore, the investigation of the call stack with tools
like `traceback()` or `browser()` can result in an overwhelming number
of steps and functions. As the auto-conversions cascade nearly
unpredictably (as illustrated in Table [1](#tab:ex_base_funs)), this may
lead to undetected errors and thus to misinterpretation of the reported
results.

  ----------------- ----------------- ----------------- --------------- ---------------------

  : Table 1: Input and output for some simple mathematical functions
  from the *base* package (R-3.4.0). Outputs marked with "(w)" have
  issued a warning message.
:::

As a final motivating example, consider the following function which
uses the base functions `diff()` and `range()` to calculate the
range $r = x_\text{max} - x_\text{min}$ of a numerical input vector `x`:

``` r
  myrange <- function(x) {
    diff(range(x))
  }
```

This function is expected to return a single numerical value,
e.g. `myrange(1:10)` returns `9`. However, the calls `myrange(NULL)` and
`myrange(integer(0))` also return such an unsuspicious, single numeric
value: `-Inf`. Both calls signal warnings, but warnings can rather
easily be overlooked and are hard to track down. It would arguably be
much better to directly get an error message informing the user that
something unintended is happening. In the worst case the warnings do not
surface and -- if this piece of code is embedded in a larger analysis --
wrong conclusions are drawn.

The described problems lead to a concept called "defensive programming"
where the programmer is responsible for manually checking function
arguments. Reacting to unexpected input as soon as possible by signaling
errors instantaneously with a helpful error message is the key aspect of
this programming paradigm. A similar concept is called "design by
contract" which demands the definition of formal, precise and verifiable
input and in return guarantees a sane program flow if all preconditions
hold. For `myrange()`, it would be necessary to insist that `x` is a
numeric vector with at least one element to ensure a meaningful result.
Additionally, missing values must be dealt with, either by completely
prohibit them or by ensuring a meaningful return value. The package
[*checkmate*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=checkmate) assists the
programmer in writing such assertions in a concise way for the most
important R variable types and objects. For `myrange()`, adding the line

``` r
  assertNumeric(x, min.len = 1, any.missing = FALSE)
```

would be sufficient to ensure a sane program flow.

# Related work {#sec:related_work}

Many packages contain custom code to perform argument checks. These
either rely on (a) the base function `stopifnot()` or (b) hand-written
cascades of `if-else` blocks containing calls to `stop()`. Option (a)
can be considered a quick hack because the raised error messages lack
helpful details or instructions for the user. Option (b) is the natural
way of doing argument checks in R but quickly becomes tedious. For this
reason many packages have their own functions included, but there are
also some packages on CRAN whose sole purpose are argument checks.

The
package [*assertthat*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=assertthat) [@wickham_2017]
provides the "drop-in replacement" `assert_that()` for R's `stopifnot()`
while generating more informative help messages. This is achieved by
evaluating the expression passed to the function `assert_that()` in an
environment where functions and operators from the base package (e.g. 
`as.numeric()` or `‘==‘`) are overloaded by more verbose counterparts.
E.g., to check a variable to be suitable to pass to the `log()`
function, one would require a numeric vector with all positive elements
and no missing values:

``` r
  assert_that(is.numeric(x), length(x) > 0, all(!is.na(x)), all(x >= 0))
```

For example, the output of the above statement for the input
`c(1, NA, 3)` reads `"Error: Elements 2 of !is.na(x) are not true"`.
Additionally, *assertthat* offers some additional convenience functions
like `is.flag()` to check for single logical values or `has_name()` to
check for presence of specific names. These functions also prove useful
if used with `see_if()` instead of `assert_that()` which turns the
passed expression into a predicate function returning a logical value.

The package
[*assertive*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=assertive) [@cotton_2016]
is another popular package for argument checks. Its functionality is
split over 16 packages containing over 400 functions, each specialized
for a specific class of assertions: For instance,
[*assertive.numbers*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=assertive.numbers)
specializes on checks of numbers and
[*assertive.sets*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=assertive.sets)
offers functions to work with sets. The functions are grouped into
functions starting with `is_` for predicate functions and functions
starting with `assert_` to perform `stopifnot()`-equivalent operations.
The author provides a "checklist of checks" as package vignette to
assist the user in picking the right functions for common situations
like checks for numeric vectors or for working with files. Picking up
the `log()` example again, the input check with *assertive* translates
to:

``` r
  assert_is_numeric(x)
  assert_is_non_empty(x)
  assert_all_are_not_na(x)
  assert_all_are_greater_than_or_equal_to(x, 0)
```

The error message thrown by the first failing assertion for the input
`c(1, NA, 3)` reads `"is_not_na : The values of x are sometimes NA."`.
Additionally, a `data.frame` is printed giving detailed information
about "bad values":

``` r
    There was 1 failure:
    Position Value   Cause
  1        2    NA missing
```

Moreover, the package
[*assertr*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=assertr) [@fischetti_2016]
focuses on assertions for
[*magrittr*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=magrittr) [@bache_2014]
pipelines and data frame operations in
[*dplyr*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=dplyr) [@wickham_2016], but
is not intended for generic runtime assertions.

# The *checkmate* package {#sec:checkmate}

## Design goals {#ssec:design}

The package has been implemented with the following goals in mind:

Runtime

:   To minimize any concern about the extra computation time required
    for assertions, most functions directly jump into compiled code to
    perform the assertions directly on the SEXPs. The functions also
    have been extensively optimized to first perform inexpensive checks
    in order to be able to skip the more expensive ones.

Memory

:   In many domains the user input can be rather large, e.g. long
    vectors and high dimensional matrices are common in text mining and
    bioinformatics. Basic checks, e.g. for missingness, are already
    quite time consuming, but if intermediate objects of the same
    dimension have to be created, runtimes easily get out of hand. For
    example, `any(x < 0)` with `x` being a large numeric matrix
    internally first allocates a logical matrix `tmp` with the same
    dimensions as `x`. The matrix `tmp` is then passed in a second step
    to `any()` which aggregates the logical matrix to a single logical
    value and `tmp` is marked to be garbage collected. Besides a
    possible shortage of available memory, which may cause the machine
    to swap or the R interpreter to terminate, runtime is wasted with
    unnecessary memory management. *checkmate* solves this problem by
    looping directly over the elements and thereby avoiding any
    intermediate objects.

Code completion

:   The package aims to provide a single function for all frequently
    used R objects and their respective characteristics and attributes.
    This way, the built-in code completion of advanced R editors assist
    in finding the suitable further restrictions. For example, after
    typing the function name and providing the object to check
    (`"assertNumeric(x,"`), many editors look up the function and
    suggest additional function arguments via code completion. In this
    example, checks to restrict the length, control the missingness or
    setting lower and upper bounds are suggested. These suggestions are
    restrictions on `x` specific for the respective base type (numeric).
    Such context-sensitive assistance helps writing more concise
    assertions.

The focus on runtime and memory comes at the price of error messages
being less informative in comparison to *assertthat* or *assertive*.
Picking up the previous example with input `c(1, NA, 3)`, *checkmate*'s
`assertNumeric(x, any.missing = FALSE, lower = 0)` immediately raises an
exception as soon as the `NA` is discovered at position 2. The package
refrains from reporting an incomplete list of positions of missing
values, instead the error message just reads
`"Assertion on ’x’ failed: Contains missing values."`. Thus, the
implementations in *assertive* or *assertr* are better suited to find
bad values in data and especially in data frames. *checkmate* is
designed to amend functions with quick assertions in order to ensure a
sane program flow. Nevertheless, the provided information is sufficient
to quickly locate the error and start investigations with the debugging
tools provided by R.

## Naming scheme {#ssec:naming}

The core functions of the package follow a specific naming scheme: The
first part (prefix) of a function name determines the action to perform
w.r.t. the outcome of the respective check while the second part of a
function name (suffix) determines the base type of the object to check.
The first argument of all functions is always the object `x` to check
and further arguments specify additional restrictions on `x`.

### Prefixes

There are currently four families of functions, grouped by their prefix,
implemented in *checkmate*:

assert\*

:   Functions prefixed with "assert" throw an exception if the
    corresponding check fails and the checked object is returned
    invisibly on success. This family of functions is suitable for many
    different tasks. Besides argument checks of user input, this family
    of functions can also be used as a drop-in replacement for
    `stopifnot()` in unit tests using the internal test mechanism of R
    as described in Writing R Extensions [@rcoreteam_2016], Subsection
    1.1.5. Furthermore, as the object to check is returned invisibly,
    the functions can also be used inside *magrittr* pipelines.

test\*

:   Functions prefixed with "test" are predicate functions which return
    `TRUE` if the respective check is successful and `FALSE` otherwise.
    This family of functions is best utilized if different checks must
    be combined in a non-trivial manner or custom error messages are
    required.

expect\*

:   Functions prefixed with "expect" are intended to be used together
    with
    [*testthat*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=testthat) [@wickham_2011]:
    the check is translated to an expectation which is then forwarded to
    the active *testthat* reporter. This way, *checkmate* extends the
    facilities of *testthat* with dozens of powerful helper functions to
    write efficient and comprehensive unit tests. Note that *testthat*
    is an optional dependency and the `expect`-functions only work if
    *testthat* is installed. Thus, to use *checkmate* as an *testthat*
    extension, *checkmate* must be listed in `Suggests` or `Imports` of
    a package.

check\*

:   Functions prefixed with "check" return the error message as a string
    if the respective check fails, and `TRUE` otherwise. Functions with
    this prefix are the workhorses called by the "assert", "test" and
    "expect" families of functions and prove especially useful to
    implement custom assertions. They can also be used to collect error
    messages in order to generate reports of multiple check violations
    at once.

The prefix and the suffix can be combined in both "camelBack" and
"underscore_case" fashion. In other words, checkmate offers all
functions with the "assert", "test" and "check" prefix in both
programming style flavors: `assert_numeric()` is a synonym for
`assertNumeric()` the same way `testDataFrame()` can be used instead of
`test_data_frame()`. By supporting the two most predominant coding
styles for R, most programmers can stick to their favorite style while
implementing runtime assertions in their packages.

### Suffixes

While the prefix determines the action to perform on a successful or
failed check, the second part of each function name defines the base
type of the first argument `x`, e.g. `integer`, `character` or `matrix`.
Additional function arguments restrict the object to fulfill further
properties or attributes.

#### Atomics and Vectors

The most important built-in atomics are supported via the suffixes
`*Logical`, `*Numeric`, `*Integer`, `*Complex`, `*Character`, `*Factor`,
and `*List` (strictly speaking, "numeric" is not an atomic type but a
naming convention for objects of type `integer` or `double`). Although
most operations that work on real values also are applicable to natural
numbers, the contrary is often not true. Therefore numeric values
frequently need to be converted to integer, and `*Integerish` ensures a
conversion without surprises by checking double values to be "nearby" an
integer w.r.t. a machine-dependent tolerance. Furthermore, the object
can be checked to be a `vector`, an `atomic` or an atomic vector (a
`vector`, but not `NULL`).

All functions can optionally test for missing values (any or all
missing), length (exact, minimum and maximum length) as well as names
being

::: enumerate*
not present,

present and not `NA`/empty,

present, not `NA`/empty and unique, or

present, not `NA`/empty, unique and additionally complying to R's
variable naming scheme.
:::

There are more type-specific checks, e.g. bound checks for numerics or
regular expression matching for characters. These are documented in full
detail in the manual.

#### Scalars

Atomics of length one are called scalars. Although R does not
differentiate between scalars and vectors internally, scalars deserve
particular attention in assertions as arguably most function arguments
are expected to be scalar. Although scalars can also be checked with the
functions that work on atomic vectors and additionally restricting to
length 1 via argument `len`, *checkmate* provides some useful
abbreviations: `*Flag` for logical scalars, `*Int` for an integerish
value, `*Count` for a non-negative integerish values, `*Number` for
numeric scalars and `*String` for scalar character vectors. Missing
values are prohibited for all scalar values by default as scalars are
usually not meant to hold data where missingness occurs naturally (but
can be allowed explicitly via argument `na.ok`). Again, additional
type-specific checks are available which are described in the manual.

#### Compound types

The most important compound types are matrices/arrays (vectors of type
logical, numeric or character with attribute `dim`) and data frames
(lists with attribute `row.names` and class `data.frame` storing atomic
vectors of same length). The package also includes checks for the
popular `data.frame` alternatives
[*data.table*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=data.table) [@dowle_2017]
and
[*tibble*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=tibble) [@wickham_2017-1].
Some checkable characteristics conclude the internal type(s),
missingness, dimensions or dimension names.

#### Miscellaneous

On top of the already described checks, there are functions to work with
sets (`*Subset`, `*Choice` and `*SetEqual`), environments
(`*Environment`) and objects of class "Date" (`*Date`). The `*Function`
family checks R functions and its arguments and `*OS` allows to check if
R is running on a specific operating system. The functions `*File` and
`*Directory` test for existence and access rights of files and
directories, respectively. The function `*PathForOutput` allows to check
whether a directory can be used to store files in it. Furthermore,
*checkmate* provides functions to check the class or names of arbitrary
R objects with `*Class` and `*Names`.

#### Custom checks

Extensions are possible by writing a `check*` function which returns
`TRUE` on success and an informative error message otherwise. The
exported functionals `makeAssertionFunction()`, `makeTestFunction()` and
`makeExpectationFunction()` can wrap this custom check function to
create the required counterparts in such a way that they seamlessly fit
into the package. The vignette demonstrates this with a check function
for square matrices.

## DSL for argument checks {#ssec:dsl}

Most basic checks can alternatively be performed using an implemented
Domain Specific Language (DSL) via the functions `qassert()`, `qtest()`
or `qexpect()`. All three functions have two arguments: The arbitrary
object `x` to check and a "rule" which determines the checks to perform
provided as a single string. Each rules consist of up to three parts:

1.  The first character determines the expected class of `x`, e.g. "n"
    for numeric, "b" for boolean, "f" for a factor or "s" for a string
    (more can be looked up in the manual). By using a lowercase letter,
    missing values are permitted while an uppercase letter disallows
    missingness.

2.  The second part is the length definition. Supported are "?" for
    length 0 or length 1, "+" for length $\geq 1$ as well as arbitrary
    length specifications like "1"/"==1" for exact length 1 or "\<10"
    for length $<10$.

3.  The third part triggers a range check, if applicable, in interval
    notation (e.g., "$[0,1)$" for values $0 \leq x < 1$). If the
    boundary value on an open side of the interval is missing, all
    values of `x` will be checked for being $>-\infty$ or $< \infty$,
    respectively.

Although this syntax requires some time to familiarize with, it allows
to write extensive argument checks with very few keystrokes. For
example, the previous check for the input of `log()` translates to the
rule `"N+[0,]"`. More examples can be found in
Table [2](#tab:dsl_examples)

:::

As the function signature is really simplistic, it is perfectly suited
to be used from compiled code written in C/C++ to check arbitrary
`SEXP`s. For this reason *checkmate* provides header files which
third-party packages can link against. Instructions can be found in the
package vignette.

# Benchmarks {#sec:benchmarks}

This small benchmark study picks up the $\log()$ example once again:
testing a vector to be numeric with only positive, non-missing values.

## Implementations {#ssec:implementations}

Now we compare *checkmate*'s `assertNumeric()` and `qassert()` (as
briefly described in the previous Section [3.3](#ssec:dsl)) with
counterparts written with R's `stopifnot()`, *assertthat*'s
`assert_that()` and a series of *assertive*'s `assert_*()` functions:

``` r
  checkmate <- function(x) \{ assertNumeric(x, any.missing = FALSE, lower = 0) \}
  qcheckmate <- function(x) \{ qassert(x, "N[0,]") \}
  R <- function(x) \{ stopifnot(is.numeric(x), all(!is.na(x)), all(x >= 0)) \}
  assertthat <- function(x) \{ assert_that(is.numeric(x), all(!is.na(x)), all(x >= 0)) \}
  assertive <- function(x) \{ assert_is_numeric(x); assert_all_are_not_na(x);
    assert_all_are_greater_than_or_equal_to(x, 0) \}
```

To allow measurement of failed assertions, the wrappers are additionally
wrapped into a `try()` statement. Note that all functions perform the
checks in the same order: First they check for type numeric, then for
missing values and finally for all elements being non-negative. The
source code for this benchmark study is hosted on *checkmate*'s project
page in the directory `inst/benchmarks`.

## Setup

The benchmark was performed on an Intel i5-6600 with 16   running
R-3.4.0 on a 64bit Arch Linux installation using a 4.10.11 kernel. The
package versions are 1.8.2 for *checkmate*, 0.2 for *assertthat* and
0.3.5 for *assertive*. R, the linked OpenBLAS and all packages have been
compiled with the GNU Compiler Collection (GCC) in version 6.3.1 and
tuned with `march=native` on optimization level `-O2`. To compare
runtime differences,
[*microbenchmark*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=microbenchmark) [@mersmann_2015]
is set to do 100 replications. The implemented wrappers have also been
compared to their byte-compiled version (using `compiler::cmpfun`) with
no notable difference in performance. The just-in-time compiler which is
enabled per default as of R-3.4.0 causes a small but non-crucial
decrease in performance for all implementations. The presented results
are extracted from the uncompiled versions of these wrappers, with the
JIT enabled on the default level 3.

Memory consumption is measured with the `benchexec` [@beyer_2015]
framework, version 1.10. Unlike R's `gc()` which only keeps track of
allocations of SEXPs, `benchexec` measures all allocations (e.g., using
C's `malloc`) and also works well with threads and child processes. Note
that setting an upper memory limit is mandatory to ensure comparable
measurements for memory consumption. Here, all processes are started
with an upper limit of 2  .

## Results

The benchmark is performed on four different inputs and the resulting
timings are presented in Figure [1](#fig:benchmark).

assertion "$x$ must be a numeric vector with all elements positive and

Note that the runtimes on the $x$-axis are on $\log_{10}$-scale and use
different units of measurement.

top left

:   Input `x` is a scalar character value, i.e. of wrong type. This
    benchmark serves as a measurement of overhead: the first performed
    (and cheapest) assertion on the type of `x` directly fails. In fact,
    all assertion frameworks only require microseconds to terminate. R
    directly jumps into compiled code via a `Primitive` and therefore
    has the least overhead. *checkmate* on the other hand has to jump
    into the compiled code via the `.Call` interface which is comparably
    slower. The implementation in *assertthat* is faster than
    *checkmate* (as it also primarily calls primitives) but slightly
    slower than `stopifnot()`. The implementation in *assertive* is the
    slowest. However, in case of assertions (in comparison to tests
    returning logical values), the runtimes for a successful check are
    arguably more important than for a failed check because the latter
    raises an exception which usually is a rare event in the program
    flow and thus not time-critical. Therefore, the next benchmark might
    be more relevant for many applications.

:   Here, the input `x` is a valid numeric value. The implementations
    now additionally check for both missingness and negative values
    without raising an exception. The DSL variant `qassert()` is the
    fastest implementation, followed by *checkmate*'s `assertNumeric()`.
    Although `qassert()` and `assertNumeric()` basically call the same
    code internally, `qassert()` has less overhead due to its minimalist
    interface. R's `stopifnot()` is a tad slower (comparing the median
    runtimes) but still faster than *assertthat* (5x slowdown in
    comparison to `qassert()`). *assertive* is \>70x slower than
    `qassert()`.

bottom left

:   Input `x` is now a long vector with $10^6$ numeric elements. This
    vector is generated using `runif()` and thus all values are valid
    (no negative or missing values). *checkmate* has the fastest
    versions with a speedup of approximately 3.5x compared to R's
    `stopifnot()` and `assert_that()`. In comparison to its
    alternatives, *checkmate* avoids intermediate objects as described
    in [3.1](#ssec:design): Instead of allocating a `logical(1e6)`
    vector first to aggregate it in a second step, *checkmate* directly
    operates on the numeric input. That is also the reason why
    `stopifnot()` and `assertthat()` have high variance in their
    runtimes: The garbage collector occasionally gets triggered to free
    memory which requires a substantial amount of time.

    *assertive* is orders of magnitude slower for this input (\>1200x)
    because it follows a completely different philosophy: Instead of
    focusing on speed, *assertive* gathers detailed information while
    performing the assertion. This yields report-like error messages
    (e.g., the index and reason why an assertion failed, for each
    element of the vector) but is comparably slow.

bottom right

:   Input `x` is again a large vector, but the first element is a
    missing value. Here, all implementations first successfully check
    the type of `x` and then throw an error about the missing value at
    position 1. Again, *checkmate* avoids allocating intermediate
    objects which in this case yields an even bigger speedup: While the
    other packages first check $10^6$ elements for missingness to create
    a `logical(1e6)` vector which is then passed to `any()`, *checkmate*
    directly stops after analyzing the first element of `x`. This
    obvious optimization yields a speedup of 25x in comparison to R and
    *assertthat* and a 7000x speedup in comparison to *assertive*.

    Note that this is the best case scenario for early stopping to
    demonstrate the possible effect memory allocation can have on the
    runtime. Triggering the assertion on the last element of the vector
    results in runtimes roughly equivalent to the previous benchmark
    displayed at bottom left. A randomly placed bad value yields
    runtimes in the range of these two extremes.

Memory has been measured using `x = runif(1e7)` as input (similar to the
setup of the benchmark shown in the bottom left of
Figure [1](#fig:benchmark)). Measurements are repeated 100 times in
independent calls of `Rscript` via the command line tool `runexec` and
summarized by the mean and standard deviation. A no-operation (startup
of R, creating the vector `x` and terminating) requires 105.0 ± .4  .
The same script which additionally loads the *checkmate* package and
performs the assertion with the above defined wrapper `checkmate()` does
not increase the memory footprint (105.1 ± .2  ) notably. Same for the
previously defined wrapper `qcheckmate()` (105.0 ± .1  ). The equivalent
assertion using base R requires 185.1 ± .1  , about the same as the
implementation in *assertthat* (185.1 ± .1  ). Using *assertive*,
1601.8 ± .6   are required to run the script.

Summed up, *checkmate* is the fastest option to perform expensive checks
and only causes a small decrease in performance for trivial, inexpensive
checks which fail quickly (top left). Although the runtime differences
seem insignificant for small input (top right), the saved microseconds
can easily sum up to minutes or hours if the respective assertion is
located in a hot spot of the program and therefore is called millions of
times. By avoiding intermediate objects, assertions have virtually no
memory overhead. This saves runtime in the garbage collection, and even
becomes much more important as data grows bigger.

# Conclusion {#sec:conclusion}

Runtime assertions are a necessity in R to ensure a sane program flow,
but R itself offers very limited capabilities to perform these kind of
checks. *checkmate* allows programmers and package developers to write
assertions in a concise way without unnecessarily sacrificing runtime
performance nor increasing the memory footprint. Compared to the
presented alternatives, assertions with *checkmate* are faster, tailored
for bigger data and (with the help of code completion) more convenient
to write. They generate helpful error messages, are extensively tested
for correctness and suitable for large and extensive software projects
([*mlr*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=mlr) [@bischl_2016],
[*BatchJobs*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=BatchJobs) [@bischl_2015]
and
[*batchtools*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=batchtools) [@batchtools]
already make heavy use of *checkmate*). Furthermore, *checkmate* offers
capabilities to perform assertions on SEXPs in compiled code via a
domain specific language and extends the popular unit testing framework
*testthat* with many helpful expectation functions.
