title: 'krippendorffsalpha: An R Package for Measuring Agreement Using Krippendorff''s
  Alpha Coefficient'
abstract: ' R package [krippendorffsalpha](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=krippendorffsalpha)
  provides tools for measuring agreement using Krippendorff''s $\alpha$ coefficient,
  a well-known nonparametric measure of agreement (also called inter-rater reliability
  and various other names). This article first develops Krippendorff''s $\alpha$ in
  a natural way and situates $\alpha$ among statistical procedures. Then, the usage
  of package [krippendorffsalpha](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=krippendorffsalpha)
  is illustrated via analyses of two datasets, the latter of which was collected during
  an imaging study of hip cartilage. The package permits users to apply the $\alpha$
  methodology using built-in distance functions for the nominal, ordinal, interval,
  or ratio levels of measurement. User-defined distance functions are also supported.
  The fitting function can accommodate any number of units, any number of coders,
  and missingness. Bootstrap inference is supported, and the bootstrap computation
  can be carried out in parallel. '
