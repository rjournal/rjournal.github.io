title: 'SMR: An R package for computing the externally studentized normal midrange
  distribution'
abstract: 'The main purpose of this paper is to present the main algorithms underlining
  the con struction and implementation of the SMR package, whose aim to compute studentized
  normal midrange distribution. Details on the externally studentized normal midrange
  and standardized normal midrange distributions are also given. The package follows
  the same structure as the prob ability functions implemented in R. That is: the
  probability density function (dSMR), the cumulative distribution function (pSMR),
  the quantile function (qSMR) and the random number generating function (rSMR). The
  pseudocodes and illustrative examples of how to use the package are presented.'
