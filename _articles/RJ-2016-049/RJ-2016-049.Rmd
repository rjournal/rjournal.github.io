title: 'dCovTS: Distance Covariance/Correlation for Time Series'
abstract: The distance covariance function is a new measure of dependence between
  random vectors. We drop the assumption of iid data to introduce distance covariance
  for time series. The R package dCovTS provides functions that compute and plot distance
  covariance and correlation functions for both univariate and multivariate time series.
  Additionally it includes functions for testing serial independence based on distance
  covariance. This paper describes the theoretical background of distance covariance
  methodology in time series and discusses in detail the implementation of these methods
  with the R package dCovTS.
