title: A New Versatile Discrete Distribution
abstract: This paper introduces a new flexible distribution for discrete data. Approximate
  moment estimators of the parameters of the distribution, to be used as starting
  values for numerical opti mization procedures, are discussed. “Exact” moment estimation,
  effected via a numerical procedure, and maximum likelihood estimation, are considered.
  The quality of the results produced by these estimators is assessed via simulation
  experiments. Several examples are given of fitting instances of the new distribution
  to real and simulated data. It is noted that the new distribution is a member of
  the exponential family. Expressions for the gradient and Hessian of the log-likelihood
  of the new distribution are derived. The former facilitates the numerical maximization
  of the likelihood with optim(); the latter provides means of calculating or estimating
  the covariance matrix of of the parame ter estimates. A discrepancy between estimates
  of the covariance matrix obtained by inverting the Hessian and those obtained by
  Monte Carlo methods is discussed.
