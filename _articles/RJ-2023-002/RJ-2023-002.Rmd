title: 'DGLMExtPois: Advances in Dealing with Over and Under-dispersion in a Double
  GLM Framework'
abstract: In recent years the use of regression models for under-dispersed count data,
  such as COM-Poisson or hyper-Poisson models, has increased. In this paper the DGLMExtPois
  package is presented. DGLMExtPois includes a new procedure to estimate the coefficients
  of a hyper-Poisson regression model within a GLM framework. The estimation process
  uses a gradient-based algorithm to solve a nonlinear constrained optimization problem.
  The package also provides an implementation of the COM-Poisson model, proposed by
  @huang, to make it easy to compare both models. The functionality of the package
  is illustrated by fitting a model to a real dataset. Furthermore, an experimental
  comparison is made with other related packages, although none of these packages
  allow you to fit a hyper-Poisson model.
