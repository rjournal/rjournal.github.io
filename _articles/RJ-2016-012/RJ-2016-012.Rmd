title: Heteroscedastic Censored and Truncated Regression with crch
abstract: The crch package provides functions for maximum likelihood estimation of
  censored or truncated regression models with conditional heteroscedasticity along
  with suitable standard methods to summarize the fitted models and compute predictions,
  residuals, etc. The supported distributions include leftor right-censored or truncated
  Gaussian, logistic, or student-t distributions with potentially different sets of
  regressors for modeling the conditional location and scale. The models and their
  R implementation are introduced and illustrated by numerical weather prediction
  tasks using precipitation data for Innsbruck (Austria).
