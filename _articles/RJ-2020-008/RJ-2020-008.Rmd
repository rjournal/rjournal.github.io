title: Linear Fractional Stable Motion with the rlfsm R Package
abstract: 'Linear fractional stable motion is a type of a stochastic integral driven
  by symmetric alpha-stable LÃ©vy motion. The integral could be considered as a non-Gaussian
  analogue of the fractional Brownian motion. The present paper discusses R package
  rlfsm created for numerical procedures with the linear fractional stable motion.
  It is a set of tools for simulation of these processes as well as performing statistical
  inference and simulation studies on them. We introduce: tools that we developed
  to work with that type of motions as well as methods and ideas underlying them.
  Also we perform numerical experiments to show finite-sample behavior of certain
  estimators of the integral, and give an idea of how to envelope workflow related
  to the linear fractional stable motion in S4 classes and methods. Supplementary
  materials, including codes for numerical experiments, are available online. rlfsm
  could be found on CRAN and gitlab.'
