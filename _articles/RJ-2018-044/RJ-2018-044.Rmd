title: 'revengc: An R package to Reverse Engineer Summarized Data'
abstract: Decoupled (e.g. separate averages) and censored (e.g. > 100 species) variables
  are continually reported by many well-established organizations, such as the World
  Health Organization (WHO), Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and
  World Bank. The challenge therefore is to infer what the original data could have
  been given summarized information. We present an R package that reverse engineers
  censored and/or decoupled data with two main functions. The cnbinom.pars() function
  estimates the average and dispersion parameter of a censored univariate frequency
  table. The rec() function reverse engineers summarized data into an uncensored bivariate
  table of probabilities.
