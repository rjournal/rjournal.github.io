title: 'Farewell''s Linear Increments Model for Missing Data: The FLIM package'
abstract: Missing data is common in longitudinal studies. We present a package for
  Farewell’s Linear Increments Model for Missing Data (the FLIM package), which can
  be used to fit linear models for observed increments of longitudinal processes and
  impute missing data. The method is valid for data with regular observation patterns.
  The end result is a list of fitted models and a hypothetical complete dataset corresponding
  to the data we might have observed had individuals not been missing. The FLIM package
  may also be applied to longitudinal studies for causal analysis, by considering
  counterfactual data as missing data for instance to compare the effect of different
  treatments when only data from observational studies are available. The aim of this
  article is to give an introduction to the FLIM package and to demonstrate how the
  package can be applied.
