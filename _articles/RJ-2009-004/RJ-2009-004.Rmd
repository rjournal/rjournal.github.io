title: Easier parallel computing in R with snowfall and sfCluster
abstract: Many statistical analysis task in areas such as bioinformatics are computationally
  very intensive, while lots of them rely on embarrasingly parallel computations (Ananth
  Grama, 2003). Multiple computers or even multiple processor cores on standard desktop
  computers, which are widespread available nowadays, can easily contribute to faster
  analyses.
