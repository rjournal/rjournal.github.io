title: 'The R Package smicd: Statistical Methods for Interval-Censored Data'
abstract: ' The package allows the use of two new statistical methods for the analysis
  of interval-censored data: 1) direct estimation/prediction of statistical indicators
  and 2) linear (mixed) regression analysis. Direct estimation of statistical indicators,
  for instance, poverty and inequality indicators, is facilitated by a non parametric
  kernel density algorithm. The algorithm is able to account for weights in the estimation
  of statistical indicators. The standard errors of the statistical indicators are
  estimated with a non parametric bootstrap. Furthermore, the package offers statistical
  methods for the estimation of linear and linear mixed regression models with an
  interval-censored dependent variable, particularly random slope and random intercept
  models. Parameter estimates are obtained through a stochastic expectation-maximization
  algorithm. Standard errors are estimated using a non parametric bootstrap in the
  linear regression model and by a parametric bootstrap in the linear mixed regression
  model. To handle departures from the model assumptions, fixed (logarithmic) and
  data-driven (Box-Cox) transformations are incorporated into the algorithm. '
