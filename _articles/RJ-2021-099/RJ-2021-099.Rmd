title: Analysis of Corneal Data in R with the rPACI Package
abstract: In ophthalmology, the early detection of keratoconus is still a crucial
  problem. Placido disk corneal topographers are essential in clinical practice, and
  many indices for diagnosing corneal irregularities exist. The main goal of this
  work is to present the R package rPACI, providing several functions to handle and
  analyze corneal data. This package implements primary indices of corneal irregularity
  (based on geometrical properties) and compound indices built from the primary ones,
  either using a generalized linear model or as a Bayesian classifier using a hybrid
  Bayesian network and performing approximate inference. rPACI aims to make the analysis
  of corneal data accessible for practitioners and researchers in the field. Moreover,
  a shiny app was developed to use rPACI in any web browser in a truly user-friendly
  graphical interface without installing R or writing any R code. It is openly deployed
  at https://admaldonado.shinyapps.io/rPACI/.
