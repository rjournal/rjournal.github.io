	abstract = {For the past two decades the Cox proportional hazards model has been used extensively to examine the covariate effects on the hazard function for the failure time variable. On the other hand, the accelerated failure time model, which simply regresses the logarithm of the survival time over the covariates, has seldom been utilized in the analysis of censored survival data. In this article, we review some newly developed linear regression methods for analysing failure time observations. These procedures have sound theoretical justification and can be implemented with an efficient numerical method. The accelerated failure time model has an intuitive physical interpretation and would be a useful alternative to the Cox model in survival analysis.},

Feed forward neural networks were recently considered for flexible non-linear modelling of censored survival data through the generalization of both discrete and continuous time models. We show that by treating the time interval as an input variable in a standard feed forward network with logistic activation and entropy error function, it is possible to estimate smoothed discrete hazards as conditional probabilities of failure. We considered an easily implementable approach with a fast selection criteria of the best configurations. Examples on data sets from two clinical trials are provided. The proposed artificial neural network (ANN) approach can be applied for the estimation of the functional relationships between covariates and time in survival data to improve model predictivity in the presence of complex prognostic relationships.},

	abstract = {Common tasks encountered in epidemiology, including disease incidence estimation and causal inference, rely on predictive modelling. Constructing a predictive model can be thought of as learning a prediction function (a function that takes as input covariate data and outputs a predicted value). Many strategies for learning prediction functions from data (learners) are available, from parametric regressions to machine learning algorithms. It can be challenging to choose a learner, as it is impossible to know in advance which one is the most suitable for a particular dataset and prediction task. The super learner (SL) is an algorithm that alleviates concerns over selecting the one ‘right’ learner by providing the freedom to consider many, such as those recommended by collaborators, used in related research or speciﬁed by subject-matter experts. Also known as stacking, SL is an entirely prespeciﬁed and ﬂexible approach for predictive modelling. To ensure the SL is well speciﬁed for learning the desired prediction function, the analyst does need to make a few important choices. In this educational article, we provide stepby-step guidelines for making these decisions, walking the reader through each of them and providing intuition along the way. In doing so, we aim to empower the analyst to tailor the SL speciﬁcation to their prediction task, thereby ensuring their SL performs as well as possible. A ﬂowchart provides a concise, easy-to-follow summary of key suggestions and heuristics, based on our accumulated experience and guided by SL optimality theory.},

	abstract = {The performance of clinical tests for disease screening is often evaluated using the area under the receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC). Recent developments have extended the traditional setting to the AUC with binary time-varying failure status. Without considering covariates, our first theme is to propose a simple and easily computed nonparametric estimator for the time-dependent AUC. Moreover, we use generalized linear models with time-varying coefficients to characterize the time-dependent AUC as a function of covariate values. The corresponding estimation procedures are proposed to estimate the parameter functions of interest. The derived limiting Gaussian processes and the estimated asymptotic variances enable us to construct the approximated confidence regions for the AUCs. The finite sample properties of our proposed estimators and inference procedures are examined through extensive simulations. An analysis of the AIDS Clinical Trials Group (ACTG) 175 data is further presented to show the applicability of the proposed methods.

	abstract = {For modern evidence-based medicine, a well thought-out risk scoring system for predicting the occurrence of a clinical event plays an important role in selecting prevention and treatment strategies. Such an index system is often established based on the subject’s “baseline” genetic or clinical markers via a working parametric or semi-parametric model. To evaluate the adequacy of such a system, C-statistics are routinely used in the medical literature to quantify the capacity of the estimated risk score in discriminating among subjects with different event times. The C-statistic provides a global assessment of a fitted survival model for the continuous event time rather than focuses on the prediction of t-year survival for a fixed time. When the event time is possibly censored, however, the population parameters corresponding to the commonly used C-statistics may depend on the study-specific censoring distribution. In this article, we present a simple C-statistic without this shortcoming. The new procedure consistently estimates a conventional concordance measure which is free of censoring. We provide a large sample approximation to the distribution of this estimator for making inferences about the concordance measure. Results from numerical studies suggest that the new procedure performs well in finite sample.},

	abstract = {Modelling of censored survival data is almost always done by Cox proportional-hazards regression. However, use of parametric models for such data may have some advantages. For example, non-proportional hazards, a potential difficulty with Cox models, may sometimes be handled in a simple way, and visualization of the hazard function is much easier. Extensions of the Weibull and log-logistic models are proposed in which natural cubic splines are used to smooth the baseline log cumulative hazard and log cumulative odds of failure functions. Further extensions to allow non-proportional effects of some or all of the covariates are introduced. A hypothesis test of the appropriateness of the scale chosen for covariate effects (such as of treatment) is proposed. The new models are applied to two data sets in cancer. The results throw interesting light on the behaviour of both the hazard function and the hazard ratio over time. The tools described here may be a step towards providing greater insight into the natural history of the disease and into possible underlying causes of clinical events. We illustrate these aspects by using the two examples in cancer.},

G-computation is an alternative because of its high statistical power. Machine learning is also increasingly used because of its possible robustness to model misspecification. In this paper, we aimed to propose an approach that combines machine learning and G-computation when both the outcome and the exposure status are binary and is able to deal with small samples. We evaluated the performances of several methods, including penalized logistic regressions, a neural network, a support vector machine, boosted classification and regression trees, and a super learner through simulations. We proposed six different scenarios characterised by various sample sizes, numbers of covariates and relationships between covariates, exposure statuses, and outcomes. We have also illustrated the application of these methods, in which they were used to estimate the efficacy of barbiturates prescribed during the first 24~h of an episode of intracranial hypertension. In the context of GC, for estimating the individual outcome probabilities in two counterfactual worlds, we reported that the super learner tended to outperform the other approaches in terms of both bias and variance, especially for small sample sizes. The support vector machine performed well, but its mean bias was slightly higher than that of the super learner. In the investigated scenarios, G-computation associated with the super learner was a performant method for drawing causal inferences, even from small sample sizes.},

Accurately predicting the time of an event of interest is of primary importance in survival analysis. Many different algorithms have been proposed for survival prediction. However, for a given prediction problem it is rarely, if ever, possible to know in advance which algorithm will perform the best. In this paper we propose two algorithms for constructing super learners in survival data prediction where the individual algorithms are based on proportional hazards. A super learner is a flexible approach to statistical learning that finds the best weighted ensemble of the individual algorithms. Finding the optimal combination of the individual algorithms through minimizing cross-validated risk controls for over-fitting of the final ensemble learner. Candidate algorithms may range from a basic Cox model to tree-based machine learning algorithms, assuming all candidate algorithms are based on the proportional hazards framework. The ensemble weights are estimated by minimizing the cross-validated negative log partial likelihood. We compare the performance of the proposed super learners with existing models through extensive simulation studies. In all simulation scenarios, the proposed super learners are either the best fit or near the best fit. The performances of the newly proposed algorithms are also demonstrated with clinical data examples.},

  abstract = {When trying to learn a model for the prediction of an outcome given a set of covariates, a statistician has many estimation procedures in their toolbox. A few examples of these candidate learners are: least squares, least angle regression, random forests, and spline regression. Previous articles (van der Laan and Dudoit (2003); van der Laan et al. (2006); Sinisi et al. (2007)) theoretically validated the use of cross validation to select an optimal learner among many candidate learners. Motivated by this use of cross validation, we propose a new prediction method for creating a weighted combination of many candidate learners to build the super learner. This article proposes a fast algorithm for constructing a super learner in prediction which uses V-fold cross-validation to select weights to combine an initial set of candidate learners. In addition, this paper contains a practical demonstration of the adaptivity of this so called super learner to various true data generating distributions. This approach for construction of a super learner generalizes to any parameter which can be defined as a minimizer of a loss function.}

  abstract = {Background:  Super learning is an ensemble machine learning approach used increasingly as an alternative to classical prediction techniques. When implementing super learning, however, not tuning the hyperparameters of the algorithms in it may adversely affect the performance of the super learner. Methods: In this case study, we used data from a Canadian electronic prescribing system to predict when primary care physicians prescribed antidepressants for indications other than depression. The analysis included 73,576 antidepressant prescriptions and 373 candidate predictors. We derived two super learners: one using tuned hyperparameter values for each machine learning algorithm identified through an iterative grid search procedure and the other using the default values. We compared the performance of the tuned super learner to that of the super learner using default values (``untuned'') and a carefully constructed logistic regression model from a previous analysis. Results: The tuned super learner had a scaled Brier score (R2) of 0.322 (95\% [confidence interval] CI = 0.267, 0.362). In comparison, the untuned super learner had a scaled Brier score of 0.309 (95\% CI = 0.256, 0.353), corresponding to an efficiency loss of 4\% (relative efficiency 0.96; 95\% CI = 0.93, 0.99). The previously-derived logistic regression model had a scaled Brier score of 0.307 (95\% CI = 0.245, 0.360), corresponding to an efficiency loss of 5\% relative to the tuned super learner (relative efficiency 0.95; 95\% CI = 0.88, 1.01). Conclusions: In this case study, hyperparameter tuning produced a super learner that performed slightly better than an untuned super learner. Tuning the hyperparameters of individual algorithms in a super learner may help optimize performance.},
