title: 'On Some Extensions to GA Package: Hybrid Optimisation, Parallelisation and
  Islands EvolutionOn some extensions to GA package: hybrid optimisation, parallelisation
  and islands evolution'
abstract: Genetic algorithms are stochastic iterative algorithms in which a population
  of individuals evolve by emulating the process of biological evolution and natural
  selection. The R package GA provides a collection of general purpose functions for
  optimisation using genetic algorithms. This paper describes some enhancements recently
  introduced in version 3 of the package. In particular, hybrid GAs have been implemented
  by including the option to perform local searches during the evolution. This allows
  to combine the power of genetic algorithms with the speed of a local optimiser.
  Another major improvement is the provision of facilities for parallel computing.
  Parallelisation has been implemented using both the master-slave approach and the
  islands evolution model. Several examples of usage are presented, with both real-world
  data examples and benchmark functions, showing that often high-quality solutions
  can be obtained more efficiently.
