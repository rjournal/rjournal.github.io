Dear Professor van der Loo and Professor Cook,
\bigskip

Please consider our revised article titled "GenMarkov:  Modeling Generalized Multivariate Markov Chains in R" for publication in the R Journal.

We have made all the minor revisions requested. In addition, given that the point-by-point answer was apparently not received, we sent the responses to the referees corresponding to the first round of revisions once more.

We believe the article is suitable for publication.
