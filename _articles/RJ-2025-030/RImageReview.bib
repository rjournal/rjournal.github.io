	abstract = {DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) are critical cellular lesions that represent a high risk for genetic instability. DSBs initiate repair mechanisms by recruiting sensor proteins and mediators. DSB biomarkers, like phosphorylated histone 2AX (γH2AX) and p53-binding protein 1 (53BP1), are detectable by immunofluorescence as either foci or distinct patterns in the vicinity of DSBs. The correlation between the number of foci and the number of DSBs makes them a useful tool for quantification of DNA damage in precision medicine, forensics and cancer research. The quantification and characterization of foci ideally uses large cell numbers to achieve statistical validity. This requires software tools that are suitable for the analysis of large complex data sets, even for users with limited experience in digital image processing. This includes, for example, pre-processing, transformation and presentation of the data in a less complex structure for further data analysis. There are numerous software solutions for the analysis of foci. This review gives an overview of open source image processing software packages, including graphical user interfaces (GUIs) such as CellProfiler, Icy and ImageJ/Fiji. Software packages like CellProfiler and Icy enable to gain high-content information about DSB biomarkers. Programming languages, like Python, are discussed briefly.},

	abstract = {For many ecological analyses powerful statistical tools are required for a profound analysis of spatial and time based data sets. In order to avoid many common errors of analysis and data acquisition a graphical user interface can help to focus on the task of the analysis and minimize the time to fulfill certain tasks in a programming language like R. In this paper we present a graphical user interface for {R} embedded in the ecological modeling software Bio7 which is based on an Eclipse rich client platform. We demonstrate that within the Bio7 platform {R} can not only be effectively combined with Java but also with the powerful components of Eclipse. Additionally we present some custom Bio7 components which interact with {R} and make use of some useful advanced concepts and libraries of this connection. Our overview on the Bio7 {R} interface also emphasizes a broad applicability for disciplines beyond ecological modeling.},

The individual variability of patients and their diverse responses to treatment options casts doubt on “one-fits-all” therapeutic strategies. Thus, biomarker-based stratification of patients into smaller cohorts is recommended. Indeed, the enormous progress in “omics” technologies has greatly supported this medical model which focused on determining disease predisposition, delivering early and targeted prevention, and/or tailoring the right therapy for each patient at the right time. Especially in the field of precision cancer therapy, the growing understanding of tumor heterogeneity and individual treatment responses has enabled the identification of adequate biomarkers. This review focuses on biomarkers for genotoxicity assessment by different methods, their characteristics, technical advances and their potential clinical applications.},

	abstract = {Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is a highly aggressive form of non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma with a long-term survival rate of around 60\% upon standard treatment with rituximab and chemotherapy. While this marks a great improvement over the pre-rituximab/pre-biologicals era, DLBCLs remain a heterogeneous disease with marked variability in clinical outcome. Efforts have been undertaken to predict its course based on characteristics such as the activated B-cell (ABC) versus germinal centre B-cell (GCB) types, but so far none of these has had much impact on treatment and outcome, and the international prognostic index, based on clinical and basic laboratory features, remains the best risk predictor. This review focuses on 13 biomarkers that have been described in the context of diagnostic tests, clinical studies or basic research related to solid and haematological malignancies in general or DLBCL in particular. These include biomarkers of the DNA repair response such as the phosphorylated histone variant 2AX (γH2AX), p53 binding protein (53BP1), Ataxia telangiectasia mutated protein (ATM), Ataxia telangiectasia and Rad3-related protein (ATR), the DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK) and Rad51 as well as proto-oncogene products like Myc, B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2), breast cancer 1 (BRCA1) and signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3). We have also included 8-Hydroxy-2'-desoxyguanosine (8-OHdG), a marker for oxidative stress, and discuss a link between two proteins involved in apoptosis, the proteasome activator 28γ (PA28γ) and tumour suppressor p53. Our investigation revealed a connection between almost all biomarkers, which are based on methods such as indirect immunofluorescence, fluorescence in-situ hybridization or immunohistochemistry.},

  abstract  = {Supervised machine learning algorithms consider the relationship between dependent and independent variables rather than the relationship between the instances. Machine learning algorithms try to learn the relationship between the input and output from the historical data in order to attain precise predictions about unseen future. Conventional foretelling algorithms are usually based on a model learned and trained from historical data. The instances in the historical data may vary in its characteristics. The variation may be a result of difference in case's pertinence degree to some cases compared to others. However, the problem with such machine learning algorithms is their dealing with the whole data without considering this variation. This paper presents a novel technique to the trained model to improve the prediction accuracy. The proposed method clusters the data using K-means clustering algorithm, and then applies the prediction algorithm to every cluster. The value of K which gives the highest accuracy is selected. The authors performed comparative study of the proposed technique and popular prediction methods namely Linear Regression, Ridge, Lasso, and Elastic. On analysing on five datasets with different sizes and different number of clusters, it was observed that the accuracy of the proposed technique is better from the point of view of Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), and coefficient of determination (Rz).},

	abstract = {Data visualization is an essential and powerful tool to generate hypotheses, uncover patterns, and disseminate ﬁndings. It is crucial that introductory statistics courses train students to become critical authors and consumers of data visualization. Ludic data sets might help teaching statistics to students by making graphics more enjoyable, using images as instantaneous feedback, encouraging to discover hidden patterns, and reducing their focus on traditional hypothesis testing. Those data sets that have hidden images can be diﬃcult to come by for teachers. These considerations have led to the development of a package that could easily create data sets from images for educational purposes. The purpose of this study is to present image2data, an R package that generates data sets from images. In this study, we show how to install the package, explain the basic arguments, and show three examples on how it can be used for teaching. Future studies could evaluate the effectiveness and motivation generated by using hidden images in data sets. Our hope is that by using hidden image in data sets, students will be inspired to decrypt data sets and discover the unexpected.},

	abstract = {Microbead-based technologies represent elegant and versatile approaches for highly parallelized quantitative multiparameter assays. They also form the basis of various techniques for detection and quantification of nucleic acids and proteins. Nucleic acid-based methods include hybridization assays, solid-phase PCR, sequencing, and trapping assays. Microbead assays have been improved in the past decades and are now important tools in routine and point-of-care diagnostics as well as in life science. Its advances include low costs, low workload, high speed and high-throughput automation. The potential of microbead-based assays therefore is apparent, and commercial applications can be found in the detection and discrimination of single nucleotide polymorphism, of pathogens, and in trapping assays. This review provides an overview on microbead-based platforms for biosensing with a main focus on nucleic acid detection (including amplification strategies and on selected probe systems using fluorescent labeling). Specific sections cover chemical properties of microbeads, the coupling of targets onto solid surfaces, microbead probe systems (mainly oligonucleotide probes), microbead detection schemes (with subsections on suspension arrays, microfluidic devices, and immobilized microbeads), quantification of nucleic acids, PCR in solution and the detection of amplicons, and methods for solid-phase amplification. We discuss selected trends such as microbead-coupled amplification, heterogeneous and homogenous DNA hybridization assays, real-time assays, melting curve analysis, and digital microbead assays. We finally discuss the relevance and trends of the methods in terms of high-level multiplexed analysis and their potential in diagnosis and personalized medicine. Contains 211 references. Figure ᅟ},

	abstract = {Lens epithelium-derived growth factor splice variant of 75 kDa (LEDGF/p75) is an autoantigen over-expressed in solid tumors and acts as a stress-related transcriptional co-activator. Participation of autoimmune responses in the pathophysiology of benign prostatic hyperplasia (PBH) and a corresponding immunosuppressive therapy by TNFalpha antagonists has been recently suggested. Thus, autoAb testing could aid in the diagnosis of BPH patients profiting from such therapy. We generated CRISPR/Cas9 modified HEp-2 LEDGF knock-out (KO) and HEp-2 LEDGF/p75 over-expressing (OE) cells and examined IgG autoantibody reactivity to LEDGF/p75 in patients with prostate cancer (PCa, n = 89), bladder cancer (BCa, n = 116), benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH, n = 103), and blood donors (BD, n = 60) by indirect immunofluorescence assay (IFA). Surprisingly, we could not detect elevated binding of autoAbs against LEDGF/p75 in cancer patients, but autoAb reactivity to LEDGF/p75 OE cells in about 50\% of patients with BPH was unexpectedly significantly increased. Furthermore, a line immunoassay enabling the detection of 18 different autoAbs revealed a significantly increased occurrence of anti-dsDNA autoAbs in 34\% of BPH patients in contrast to tumor patients and BD. This finding was confirmed by anti-mitochondrial (mDNA) autoAb detection with the Crithidia luciliae immunofluorescence test, which also showed a significantly higher prevalence (34\%) of anti-mDNA autoAbs in BPH. In summary, our study provided further evidence for the occurrence of autoimmune responses in BPH. Furthermore, LEDGF/p75 over-expression renders HEp-2 cells more autoantigenic and an ideal target for autoAb analysis in BPH with a potential therapy consequence.},

Due to the discovery of new molecules and new emerging bioanalytical problems, there is an ongoing demand for a technology platform that provides a broad range of assays with a user-friendly flexibility and rapid adaptability to new applications. Here we describe a highly versatile microscopy platform, VideoScan, for the rapid and simultaneous analysis of various assay formats based on fluorescence microscopic detection. The technological design is equally suitable for assays in solution, microbead-based assays and cell pattern recognition. The multiplex real-time capability for tracking of changes under dynamic heating conditions makes it a useful tool for PCR applications and nucleic acid hybridization, enabling kinetic data acquisition impossible to obtain by other technologies using endpoint detection. The paper discusses the technological principle of the platform regarding data acquisition and processing. Microbead-based and solution applications for the detection of diverse biomolecules, including antigens, antibodies, peptides, oligonucleotides and amplicons in small reaction volumes, are presented together with a high-content detection of autoimmune antibodies using a HEp-2 cell assay. Its adaptiveness and versatility gives VideoScan a competitive edge over other bioanalytical technologies.},

It offers several advantages, including the absence of an amplification step and the ability to analyze low-grade samples. Despite its considerable strengths, the popularity of the nCounter platform in experimental research stabilized in 2022 and 2023, and this trend may continue in the upcoming years. Such stagnation could potentially be attributed to the absence of a standardized analytical pipeline or the indication of optimal processing methods for nCounter data analysis. To standardize the description of the nCounter data analysis workflow, we divided it into five distinct steps: data pre-processing, quality control, background correction, normalization and differential expression analysis. Next, we evaluated eleven R packages dedicated to nCounter data processing to point out functionalities belonging to these steps and provide comments on their applications in studies of mRNA and miRNA samples.},

  abstract   = {R is a free open-source implementation of the S statistical computing language and programming environment. The current status of R is a command line driven interface with no advanced cross-platform graphical user interface (GUI), but it includes tools for building such. Over the past years, proprietary and non-proprietary GUI solutions have emerged, based on internal or external tool kits, with different scopes and technological concepts. For example, Rgui.exe and Rgui.app have become the de facto GUI on the Microsoft Windows and Mac OS X platforms, respectively, for most users. In this paper we discuss RKWard which aims to be both a comprehensive GUI and an integrated development environment for R. RKWard is based on the KDE software libraries. Statistical procedures and plots are implemented using an extendable plugin architecture based on ECMAScript (JavaScript), R, and XML. RKWard provides an excellent tool to manage different types of data objects; even allowing for seamless editing of certain types. The objective of RKWard is to provide a portable and extensible R interface for both basic and advanced statistical and graphical analysis, while not compromising on flexibility and modularity of the R programming environment itself.},

@article{ye_generative_2024,
	abstract = {Generative AI (GenAI) has witnessed remarkable progress in recent years and demonstrated impressive performance in various generation tasks in different domains such as computer vision and computational design. Many researchers have attempted to integrate GenAI into visualization framework, leveraging the superior generative capacity for different operations. Concurrently, recent major breakthroughs in GenAI like diffusion models and large language models have also drastically increased the potential of GenAI4VIS. From a technical perspective, this paper looks back on previous visualization studies leveraging GenAI and discusses the challenges and opportunities for future research. Specifically, we cover the applications of different types of GenAI methods including sequence, tabular, spatial and graph generation techniques for different tasks of visualization which we summarize into four major stages: data enhancement, visual mapping generation, stylization and interaction. For each specific visualization sub-task, we illustrate the typical data and concrete GenAI algorithms, aiming to provide in-depth understanding of the state-of-the-art GenAI4VIS techniques and their limitations. Furthermore, based on the survey, we discuss three major aspects of challenges and research opportunities including evaluation, dataset, and the gap between end-to-end GenAI methods and visualizations. By summarizing different generation algorithms, their current applications and limitations, this paper endeavors to provide useful insights for future GenAI4VIS research.},

@article{belcher_demystifying_2023,
	abstract = {Image-based machine learning methods are becoming among the most widely-used forms of data analysis across science, technology, engineering, and industry. These methods are powerful because they can rapidly and automatically extract rich contextual and spatial information from images, a process that has historically required a large amount of human labor. A wide range of recent scientific applications have demonstrated the potential of these methods to change how researchers study the ocean . However, despite their promise, machine learning tools are still under-exploited in many domains including species and environmental monitoring, biodiversity surveys, fisheries abundance and size estimation, rare event and species detection, the study of animal behavior, and citizen science. Our objective in this article is to provide an approachable, end-to-end guide to help researchers apply image-based machine learning methods effectively to their own research problems. Using a case study, we describe how to prepare data, train and deploy models, and overcome common issues that can cause models to underperform. Importantly, we discuss how to diagnose problems that can cause poor model performance on new imagery to build robust tools that can vastly accelerate data acquisition in the marine realm. Code to perform analyses is provided at https://github.com/heinsense2/AIO\_CaseStudy.},

	abstract = {Data science as a flourishing interdisciplinary domain of computer and mathematical sciences is playing an important role in guiding the porous material research streams. In the present narrative review, we have examined recent trends and issues in data-driven methods used in the image-based porous material research studies relevant to water resources researchers and scientists. Initially, the recent trends in porous material data-related issues have been investigated through search engine queries in terms of data source, data storage hub, programing languages, and software packages. Subsequent to a diligent analysis of the existing trends, a review of the common concepts of porous material research and data science are presented through six categories comprising big data, data regression, classification, image segmentation, geometry reconstruction, and image data resolution. We provide: (a) a focus on image-based and pore scale methods which has not been presented previously, (b) a detailed search engine research for trend investigation, and (c) practical examples and comparison of data storage in porous media image-based research. By reading this review article, an overall image of the active and popular interdisciplinary research domains can be obtained. Readers will also be informed of the latest data-driven efforts and recommended research directions for tackling the image-based porous material problems relevant to water resources research. We concluded that porous material image reconstruction and resolution improvement techniques are unique means to reveal unprecedented details of micro-structures that may have been missed in a medium quality tomography image.},

@article{niedballa_imageseg_2022,
	abstract = {Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and deep learning are powerful and robust tools for ecological applications, and are particularly suited for image data. Image segmentation (the classification of all pixels in images) is one such application and can, for example, be used to assess forest structural metrics. While CNN-based image segmentation methods for such applications have been suggested, widespread adoption in ecological research has been slow, likely due to technical difficulties in implementation of CNNs and lack of toolboxes for ecologists. Here, we present R package imageseg which implements a CNN-based workflow for general purpose image segmentation using the U-Net and U-Net++ architectures in R. The workflow covers data (pre)processing, model training and predictions. We illustrate the utility of the package with image recognition models for two forest structural metrics: tree canopy density and understorey vegetation density. We trained the models using large and diverse training datasets from a variety of forest types and biomes, consisting of 2877 canopy images (both canopy cover and hemispherical canopy closure photographs) and 1285 understorey vegetation images. Overall segmentation accuracy of the models was high with a Dice score of 0.91 for the canopy model and 0.89 for the understorey vegetation model (assessed with 821 and 367 images respectively). The image segmentation models performed significantly better than commonly used thresholding methods, and generalized well to data from study areas not included in training. This indicates robustness to variation in input images and good generalization strength across forest types and biomes. The package and its workflow allow simple yet powerful assessments of forest structural metrics using pretrained models. Furthermore, the package facilitates custom image segmentation with single or multiple classes and based on colour or grayscale images, for example, for applications in cell biology or for medical images. Our package is free, open source and available from CRAN. It will enable easier and faster implementation of deep learning-based image segmentation within R for ecological applications and beyond.},

However, most reference datasets are constructed from single-cell RNA-sequencing data and cannot be used to annotate datasets that do not measure gene expression. Here we introduce ‘bridge integration’, a method to integrate single-cell datasets across modalities using a multiomic dataset as a molecular bridge. Each cell in the multiomic dataset constitutes an element in a ‘dictionary’, which is used to reconstruct unimodal datasets and transform them into a shared space. Our procedure accurately integrates transcriptomic data with independent single-cell measurements of chromatin accessibility, histone modifications, DNA methylation and protein levels. Moreover, we demonstrate how dictionary learning can be combined with sketching techniques to improve computational scalability and harmonize 8.6 million human immune cell profiles from sequencing and mass cytometry experiments. Our approach, implemented in version 5 of our Seurat toolkit (http://www.satijalab.org/seurat), broadens the utility of single-cell reference datasets and facilitates comparisons across diverse molecular modalities.},
