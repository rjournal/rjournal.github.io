title: 'sae: An R Package for Small Area Estimation'
abstract: We describe the R package sae for small area estimation. This package can
  be used to obtain model-based estimates for small areas based on a variety of models
  at the area and unit levels, along with basic direct and indirect estimates. Mean
  squared errors are estimated by analytical approximations in simple models and applying
  bootstrap procedures in more complex models. We describe the package functions and
  show how to use them through examples.
