title: 'BondValuation: An R Package for Fixed Coupon Bond Analysis'
abstract: The purpose of this paper is to introduce the R package BondValuation for
  the analysis of large datasets of fixed coupon bonds. The conceptual heterogeneity
  of fixed coupon bonds traded in the global markets imposes a high degree of complexity
  on their comparative analysis. Contrary to baseline fixed income theory, in practice,
  most bonds feature coupon period irregularities. In addition, there are a multitude
  of day count methods that determine the interest accrual, the cash flows and the
  discount factors used in bond valuation. Several R packages, e.g., fBonds, RQuantLib,
  and YieldCurve, provide tools for fixed income analysis. Nevertheless, none of them
  is capable of evaluating bonds featuring irregular first and/or final coupon periods,
  and neither provides adequate coverage of day count conventions currently used in
  the global bond markets. The R package BondValuation closes this gap using the generalized
  valuation methodology presented in Djatschenko (2019).
