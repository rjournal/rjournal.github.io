title: Nonparametric Tests for the Interaction in Two-way Factorial Designs Using
  R
abstract: 'An increasing number of R packages include nonparametric tests for the
  interaction in two-way factorial designs. This paper briefly describes the different
  methods of testing and reports the resulting p-values of such tests on datasets
  for four types of designs: between, within, mixed, and pretest-posttest designs.
  Potential users are advised only to apply tests they are quite familiar with and
  not be guided by p-values for selecting packages and tests.'
