title: 'ggmap: Spatial Visualization with ggplot2'
abstract: In spatial statistics the ability to visualize data and models superimposed
  with their basic social landmarks and geographic context is invaluable. ggmap is
  a new tool which enables such visualization by combining the spatial information
  of static maps from Google Maps, OpenStreetMap, Stamen Maps or CloudMade Maps with
  the layered grammar of graphics implementation of ggplot2. In addition, several
  new utility functions are introduced which allow the user to access the Google Geocoding,
  Distance Matrix, and Directions APIs. The result is an easy, consistent and modular
  framework for spatial graphics with several convenient tools for spatial data analysis.
