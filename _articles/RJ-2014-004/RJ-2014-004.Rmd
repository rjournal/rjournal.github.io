title: 'brainR: Interactive 3 and 4D Images of High Resolution Neuroimage Data'
abstract: We provide software tools for displaying and publishing interactive 3-dimensional
  (3D) and 4-dimensional (4D) figures to html webpages, with examples of high-resolution
  brain imaging. Our framework is based in the R statistical software using the rgl
  package, a 3D graphics library. We build on this package to allow manipulation of
  figures including rotation and translation, zooming, coloring of brain substructures,
  adjusting transparency levels, and addition/or removal of brain structures. The
  need for better visualization tools of ultra high dimensional data is ever present;
  we are providing a clean, simple, web-based option. We also provide a package (brainR)
  for users to readily implement these tools.
