title: 'Sumo: An Authenticating Web Application with an Embedded R Session'
abstract: Sumo is a web application intended as a template for developers. It is distributed
  as a Java ‘war’ file that deploys automatically when placed in a Servlet container’s
  ‘webapps’ directory. If a user supplies proper credentials, Sumo creates a session-specific
  Secure Shell connection to the host and a user-specific R session over that connection.
  Developers may write dynamic server pages that make use of the persistent R session
  and user-specific file space. The supplied example plots a data set conditional
  on preferences indicated by the user; it also displays some static text. A companion
  server page allows the user to interact directly with the R session. Sumo’s novel
  feature set complements previous efforts to supply R functionality over the internet.
