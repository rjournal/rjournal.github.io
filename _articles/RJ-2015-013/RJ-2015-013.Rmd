title: 'fslr: Connecting the FSL Software with R'
abstract: We present the package fslr, a set of R functions that interface with FSL
  (FMRIB Software Library), a commonly-used open-source software package for processing
  and analyzing neuroimaging data. The fslr package performs operations on ‘nifti’
  image objects in R using command-line functions from FSL, and returns R objects
  back to the user. fslr allows users to develop image processing and analysis pipelines
  based on FSL functionality while interfacing with the functionality provided by
  R. We present an example of the analysis of structural magnetic resonance images,
  which demonstrates how R users can leverage the functionality of FSL without switching
  to shell commands. Glossary of acronyms MRI Magnetic Resonance Imaging/Image FSL
