title: 'ICAOD: An R Package for Finding Optimal designs for Nonlinear Statistical
  Models by Imperialist Competitive Algorithm'
abstract: ' Optimal design ideas are increasingly used in different disciplines to
  rein in experimental costs. Given a nonlinear statistical model and a design criterion,
  optimal designs determine the number of experimental points to observe the responses,
  the design points and the number of replications at each design point. Currently,
  there are very few free and effective computing tools for finding different types
  of optimal designs for a general nonlinear model, especially when the criterion
  is not differentiable. We introduce an R package [ICAOD](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=ICAOD)
  to find various types of optimal designs and they include locally, minimax and Bayesian
  optimal designs for different nonlinear statistical models. Our main computational
  tool is a novel metaheuristic algorithm called imperialist competitive algorithm
  (ICA) and inspired by socio-political behavior of humans and colonialism. We demonstrate
  its capability and effectiveness using several applications. The package also includes
  several theory-based tools to assess optimality of a generated design when the criterion
  is a convex function of the design. '
