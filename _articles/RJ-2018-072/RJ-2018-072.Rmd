title: 'Explanations of Model Predictions with live and breakDown Packages '
abstract: Complex models are commonly used in predictive modeling. In this paper we
  present R packages that can be used for explaining predictions from complex black
  box models and attributing parts of these predictions to input features. We introduce
  two new approaches and corresponding packages for such attribution, namely live
  and breakDown. We also compare their results with existing implementations of state-of-the-art
  solutions, namely, lime (Pedersen and Benesty, 2018) which implements Locally Interpretable
  Model-agnostic Explanations and iml (Molnar et al., 2018) which implements Shapley
  values.
