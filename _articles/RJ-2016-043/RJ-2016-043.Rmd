# Introduction

Analysis and visualization of geographic data are often core components
of the analytical workflow for researchers and data scientists; as such,
access to open and reliable geographic datasets are of paramount
importance. The United States Census Bureau provides access to such data
in the form of its TIGER/Line shapefile products [@censustiger2016]. The
files are extracts from the Census Bureau's Master Address
File/Topologically Integrated Geographic Encoding and Referencing
(TIGER) database, which in turn are released to the public as
shapefiles, a common format for encoding geographic data as vectors
(e.g.Â points, lines, and polygons). Available TIGER/Line shapefiles
include all of the Census Bureau's areal enumeration units, such as
states, counties, Census tracts, and Census blocks; transportation data
such as roads and railways; and both linear and areal hydrography. The
TIGER/Line files are updated annually, and include attributes that allow
them to be joined with other tabular data, including demographic data
products released by the Census Bureau.

The [*tigris*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=tigris) package aims
to simplify the process of working with these datasets for R users
[@walker2016]. With functions in *tigris*, R users can specify the data
type and geography for which they would like to obtain geographic data,
and return the corresponding TIGER/Line data as an R object of class
`"Spatial*DataFrame"`. This article provides an overview of the *tigris*
package, and gives examples that show how it can contribute to common
geographic visualization and spatial analysis workflows in R. Examples
in the article include a discussion of how *tigris* helps R users
retrieve and work with data from the US Census Bureau, as well as an
applied example of how *tigris* can fit within a common geospatial
workflow in R, in which data from the United States Internal Revenue
Service are visualized with both static and interactive cartography.

# Geographic data and Census visualization in R

The TIGER/Line files were first released by the US Census Bureau in
ASCII format in 1989, and represented street centerline data for the
entire United States. Since then, the Census Bureau has expanded the
coverage of the TIGER/Line data, and transitioned the core format of the
publicly-available files to the shapefile in 2007. TIGER/Line shapefiles
include boundary files, which encompass the boundaries of governmental
units or other areal units for which the Census Bureau tabulates data.
This includes the core Census hierarchy of areal units from the Census
block (analogous to a city block) to the entire United States, as well
as common geographic entities such as city boundaries. The Census Bureau
distinguishes between legal entities, which have official government
standing, and statistical entities, which have no legal definition but
are used for the tabulation of data. The Census Bureau also makes
available shapefiles of geographic features, which include entities such
as roads, rivers, and railroads. All TIGER/Line shapefiles are
distributed in a geographic coordinate system using the North American
Datum of 1983 (NAD83) [@census2014].

As the TIGER/Line datasets are available in shapefile format, they can
be read into and translated to R objects by the
[*rgdal*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=rgdal) package [@rgdal2].
*rgdal* is an R interface to the open-sourced Geospatial Data
Abstraction Library, or GDAL, an open-source translator that can convert
between numerous common vector and raster spatial data formats [@GDAL].
When loaded into R, shapefiles will be represented as objects of class
`"Spatial*"` by the [*sp*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=sp)
package [@bivand2013]. Most Census datasets obtained by *tigris* will be
loaded as objects of class `"SpatialPolygonsDataFrame"` given that they
represent Census areal entities; selected geographic features, such as
roads, linear water features, and landmarks, may be represented as
objects of class `"SpatialLinesDataFrame"` or
`"SpatialPointsDataFrame"`. `"Spatial*DataFrames"` are R objects that
represent spatial data as closely as possible to regular R data frames,
yet also contain information about the feature geometry and coordinate
system of the data [see @bivand2013 for more information].

Several R packages provide access to Census geographic and demographic
data. The *UScensus2000* (no longer on CRAN) and
[*UScensus2010*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=UScensus2010)
packages by Zack Almquist allow for access to several geographic
datasets for the 2000 and 2010 Censuses, including blocks, Census
tracts, and counties [@almquist2010]. These datasets can also be linked
to demographic data from the 2000 and 2010 Censuses, which are stored in
related, external packages. The
[*USABoundaries*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=USABoundaries)
package similarly provides access to some Census geographic boundary
files such as zip code tabulation areas (ZCTAs) and counties; it also
makes available historical boundary files dating back to 1629
[@mullen2015]. Another R package,
[*choroplethr*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=choroplethr), wraps
[*ggplot2*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=ggplot2) [@wickham] to
map data from the US Census Bureau's American Community Survey
aggregated to common Census geographies [@lamstein2015]. The purpose of
the *tigris* package is to help R users work with US Census Bureau
geographic data by granting direct access to the Census shapefiles via a
simple, uniform interface. Further, as *tigris* interfaces directly with
Census Bureau data stores, it ensures access to high-quality and
up-to-date geographic data for R projects.

# Core functionality of *tigris* {#core-functionality-of}

The core functionality of *tigris* consists of a series of functions,
each corresponding to a single Census Bureau geography of interest, that
grant access to geographic data from the US Census Bureau. *tigris*
allows R users to obtain both the core TIGER/Line shapefiles as well as
the Census Bureau's Cartographic Boundary Files. Cartographic Boundary
Files, following the @Census2015, \"are simplified representations of
selected geographic areas from the Census Bureau's MAF/TIGER geographic
database\" [@Census2015].

To download geographic data using *tigris*, the R user calls the
function corresponding to the desired geography. For example, to obtain
a `"SpatialPolygonsDataFrame"` of US states from the TIGER/Line dataset,
the user calls the `states()` function in *tigris*, which can then be
plotted with the `plot()` function from the
[*sp*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=sp) package, which is loaded
by *tigris* automatically:

``` r
library(tigris)
us_states <- states()
plot(us_states)
```

![Figure 1: Basic plot of US states retrieved from the Census TIGER/Line
database.](states.png){#figure:states width="100%" alt="graphic without alt text"}

The `states()` function call instructs *tigris* to fetch a TIGER/Line
shapefile from the US Census Bureau that represents the boundaries of
the 50 US states, the District of Columbia, and US territories. *tigris*
then uses *rgdal* to load the data into the user's R session as an
object of class `"Spatial*DataFrame"`. Many functions in *tigris* have a
parameter, `cb`, that if set to `TRUE` will direct *tigris* to load a
cartographic boundary file instead. Cartographic boundary files default
to a simplified resolution of 1:500,000; in some cases, as with states,
resolutions of 1:5 million and 1:20 million are available. For example,
an R user could specify the following modifications to the `states()`
function, and retrieve a simplified dataset.

``` r
us_states_20m <- states(cb = TRUE, resolution = "20m")
ri <- us_states[us_states$NAME == "Rhode Island", ]
ri_20m <- us_states_20m[us_states_20m$NAME == "Rhode Island", ]
plot(ri)
plot(ri_20m, border = "red", add = TRUE)
```

![Figure 2: Difference between default TIGER/Line and 1:20 million
cartographic boundary outlines of Rhode
Island.](rhode-island.png){#figure:rhode_island width="100%" alt="graphic without alt text"}

The plot illustrates some of the differences between the TIGER/Line
shapefiles and the cartographic boundary files, in this instance for the
state of Rhode Island. The TIGER/Line shapefiles are the most detailed
datasets in interior areas, and represent the legal boundaries for
coastal areas which extend three miles beyond the shoreline. The
Cartographic Boundary Files have less detail in interior areas, but are
clipped to the shoreline of the United States, which may be preferable
for thematic mapping but can introduce additional detail for coastal
features. A full list of the geographic datasets available through
*tigris* is found in Table 1; datasets with an asterisk are available as
both TIGER/Line and cartographic boundary files.

  denoted with an asterisk are also available as cartographic boundary
  files.

When Census data are available for download at sub-national levels, they
are referenced by their Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS)
codes, which are codes that uniquely identify geographic entities in the
Census database. When applicable, *tigris* uses smart state and county
lookup to simplify the process of data acquisition for R users. This
allows users to obtain data by supplying the name or postal code of the
desired state -- along with the name of the desired county, when
applicable -- rather than their FIPS codes. In the following example,
the R user fetches roads data for Kalawao County Hawaii, the smallest
county in the United States by area, located on the northern coast of
the island of Moloka'i.

``` r
kw_roads <- roads("HI", "Kalawao")
plot(kw_roads)
```

![Figure 3: Roads in Kalawao County,
Hawaii.](kalawao.png){#figure:kalawao width="100%" alt="graphic without alt text"}

While many Census shapefiles correspond to these common geographic
identifiers in the United States, not all datasets are identifiable in
this way. A good example is the Zip Code Tabulation Area (ZCTA), a
geographic dataset developed by the US Census Bureau to approximate zip
codes, postal codes used by the United States Postal Service. Social
data in the United States are commonly distributed at the zip code
level, including an example later in this article; however, zip codes
themselves are not coherent geographic entities, and change frequently.
ZCTAs, then, function as proxies for zip codes, and are built from
Census blocks in which a plurality of addresses on a given block have a
given zip code [@censuszip].

ZCTAs commonly cross county lines and even cross state lines in certain
instances; as such, the US Census Bureau only makes the entire ZCTA
dataset of over 33,000 zip codes available for download. Often, analysts
will not need all of these ZCTAs for a given project. *tigris* allows
users to subset ZCTAs on load with the `starts_with` parameter, which
accepts a vector of strings that contains the beginning digits of the
ZCTAs that the analyst wants to load into R. The example below retrieves
ZCTAs in the area around Fort Worth, Texas.

``` r
fw_zips <- zctas(cb = TRUE, starts_with = "761")
plot(fw_zips)
```

![Figure 4: Zip Code Tabulation Areas that start with \"761\" (near Fort
Worth, Texas).](fortworthzips.png){#figure:fortworthzips width="100%" alt="graphic without alt text"}

When *tigris* downloads Census shapefiles to the R user's computer, it
uses the [*rappdirs*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=rappdirs)
package to cache the downloads for future access [@rappdirs]. In turn,
once the R user has downloaded the Census geographic data, *tigris* will
know where to look for it and will not need to re-download. To turn off
this behavior, a *tigris* user can set
`options(tigris_use_cacheÂ =Â FALSE)` after loading the package; this will
direct *tigris* to download shapefiles to a temporary directory on the
user's computer instead, and load data into R from there.

The Census Bureau releases updated TIGER/Line shapefiles every year, and
these yearly updates are available to *tigris* users. *tigris* defaults
to the 2015 shapefiles, which at the time of this writing is the most
recent year available.. However, *tigris* users can supply a different
year to a *tigris* function as a named argument to obtain data for a
different year; for example, `yearÂ =Â 2014` in the function call will
fetch TIGER/Line shapefiles or cartographic boundary files from 2014.
Additionally, R users can set this as a global option in their R session
by entering the command `options(tigris_yearÂ =Â 2014)`.

# Data manipulation with tigris

The primary utility of the *tigris* package is for consistent and quick
data access for R users with a minimum of code. As *tigris* loads
objects of class `"Spatial*"` from the *sp* package, data analysis and
visualization using the acquired data can be handled with R's suite of
cartographic and spatial analysis packages, which will be addressed
later in the article. However, *tigris* does include two functions,
`rbind_tigris()` and `geo_join()`, to assist with common operations when
working with Census Bureau geographic data: combining datasets with one
another, or merging them to tabular data.

Some Census shapefiles, like roads, are only available by county;
however, an R user may want a roads dataset that represents multiple
counties. *tigris* has built-in functionality to handle these
circumstances. Data loaded into R by *tigris* functions are assigned a
special `"tigris"` attribute that identifies the type of geographic data
represented by the object. This attribute can be checked with the
function `tigris_type()`:

``` r
> tigris_type(kw_roads)
[1] "road"
```

Objects with the same `"tigris"` attributes can then be combined into a
single object using the function `rbind_tigris()`. In the example below,
the user loads data for Maui County, which comprises the remainder of
the island of Moloka'i as well as the islands of Maui and Lana'i. As the
roads data do not explicitly contain information about counties, an
identifying `"county"` column is specified in the example below. The
data are then plotted and colored by county; Kalawao County is colored
red in the figure.

``` r
maui_roads <- roads("HI", "Maui")
kw_roads$county <- "Kalawao"
maui_roads$county <- "Maui"
maui_kw_roads <- rbind_tigris(kw_roads, maui_roads)
plot(maui_kw_roads, col = c("red", "black")[as.factor(maui_kw_roads$county)])
```

![Figure 5: Roads in Maui County and Kalawao County,
Hawaii.](maui_kw.png){#figure:maui_kw width="100%" alt="graphic without alt text"}

The `rbind_tigris()` function also accepts a list of *sp* objects with
the same `"tigris"` attributes. This is particularly useful in the event
that an analyst needs a dataset that covers the United States, but is
only available at sub-national levels. An example of this is the Public
Use Microdata Area (PUMA), the Census geography at which
individual-level microdata samples are associated. PUMAs are available
by state in *tigris* via the `pumas()` function; however, an analyst
will commonly want PUMA geography for the entire United States to
facilitate national-level analyses. In this example, `rbind_tigris()`
can be used with `lapply()` to fetch PUMA datasets for each state and
then combine them into a dataset covering the continental United States.

*tigris* includes a built-in data frame named `fips_codes` that used to
match state and county names with Census FIPS codes in the various
functions in the package. It can also be used to generate vectors of
codes to be passed to *tigris* functions as in this example, so that the
analyst does not have to generate the full list of state codes by hand.

``` r
us_states <- unique(fips_codes$state)[1:51]
continental_states <- us_states[!us_states %in% c("AK", "HI")]
us_pumas <- rbind_tigris(
  lapply(
    continental_states, function(x) {
      pumas(state = x, cb = TRUE)
    }
  )
)
plot(us_pumas)
```

![Figure 6: Public Use Microdata Areas (PUMAs) for the continental
United States, generated with `rbind_tigris`. ](pumas.png){#figure:pumas
width="100%" alt="graphic without alt text"}

The above code directs R to iterate through the state codes for the
continental United States, fetching PUMA geography for each state and
storing it in a list which `rbind_tigris()` then combines into a
continental PUMA dataset.

The other data manipulation function in *tigris*, `geo_join()`, is
designed to assist with the common but sometimes-messy process of
merging tabular data to US Census Bureau shapefiles. Such joined data
can then be used for statistical mapping, such as a choropleth map that
shows variation in an attribute by the shading of polygons.

In the example below, an analyst uses functions in *tigris* to help
create a choropleth map that shows how the areas represented by
legislators in the Texas State House of Representatives, the lower house
of the Texas state legislature, vary by political party. By convention
in the United States, areas represented by members of the Republican
Party are shaded in red, and areas represented by members of the
Democratic Party are shaded in blue.

To accomplish this, the analyst loads in a CSV containing information on
party representation in Texas by legislative district, and uses the
`state_legislative_districts()` function to retrieve boundaries for the
legislative districts. The two datasets can then be joined with
`geo_join()`. The first argument in the `geo_join()` call represents the
object of class `"Spatial*DataFrame"`; the second argument represents a
regular R data frame. The third and fourth arguments specify the columns
in the spatial data frame and regular data frame, respectively, to be
used to match the rows; if the names of these columns are the same, that
name can be passed as a named argument to the `by` parameter, which is
unused here. Once the two datasets are joined, they can be visualized
with *sp* plotting functions.

``` r
df <- read.csv("http://personal.tcu.edu/kylewalker/data/txlege.csv", 
               stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
districts <- state_legislative_districts("TX", house = "lower", cb = TRUE)
txlege <- geo_join(districts, df, "NAME", "District")
txlege$color <- ifelse(txlege$Party == "R", "red", "blue")
plot(txlege, col = txlege$color)
legend("topright", legend = c("Republican", "Democrat"), 
       fill = c("red", "blue"))
```

![Figure 7: State legislative districts for the Texas State House of
Representatives, colored by the party affiliations of their
representatives. Data derived from *The Texas Tribune*,
<https://www.texastribune.org/directory/> ](txlege.png){#figure:txlege
width="100%" alt="graphic without alt text"}

As the plot illustrates, Democrats in Texas tend to represent areas in
and around major cities such as Dallas, Houston, and Austin, as well as
areas along the United States-Mexico border. Republicans, on the other
hand, tend to represent rural areas in addition to suburban areas on the
edges of metropolitan areas in the state.

# Analytic visualization in R using data obtained with *tigris* {#analytic-visualization-in-r-using-data-obtained-with}

To this point, this paper has employed simplified examples to
demonstrate the functionality of *tigris*; the following scenario
combines these examples into an applied analytic and visualization
workflow. The goal here is to show how *tigris* fits in with a broader
spatial analysis workflow in R. R has a plethora of packages available
for geographic visualization and spatial analysis; for analysts working
with United States geographies, *tigris* can contribute to the analytic
process by providing ample data access with a minimum of code, and
without having to retrieve datasets outside of R.

This example demonstrates how to create metropolitan area maps of
taxation data from the United States Internal Revenue Service (IRS),
which are made available at the zip code level [@irs]. As discussed
earlier, zip codes are not physical areas but rather designations given
by the United States Postal Service (USPS) to guide mail routes; as
such, ZCTAs will be used instead, and accessed with the `zctas`
function.

As ZCTAs do not have a clear correspondence between their boundaries and
those of other Census units, ZCTA boundaries will commonly cross those
of metropolitan areas, which are county-based. However, *tigris*
provides programmatic access to metropolitan area boundaries as well,
which in turn can be used to identify intersecting ZCTAs through spatial
overlay with the *sp* package. The resultant spatial data can then be
merged to data from the IRS and visualized.

Such a workflow could resemble the following. An analyst reads in raw
data from the IRS website as an R data frame, and uses the
[*dplyr*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=dplyr) package [@dplyr2] to
subset the data frame and identify the average total income reported to
the IRS by zip code in thousands of dollars in 2013, assigning it to the
variable `df`. In the original IRS dataset, `A02650` represents the
aggregate total income reported to the IRS by zip code in thousands of
dollars, and `N02650` represents the number of tax returns that reported
total income in that zip code.

``` r
library(dplyr)
library(stringr)
library(readr)

# Read in the IRS data
zip_data <- "https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-soi/13zpallnoagi.csv"
df <- read_csv(zip_data) %>%
  mutate(zip_str = str_pad(as.character(ZIPCODE), width = 5, 
                           side = "left", pad = "0"), 
         incpr = A02650 / N02650) %>%
  select(zip_str, incpr)
```

The analyst then defines a function that will leverage *tigris* to read
in Census ZCTA and metropolitan area datasets as objects of class
`"SpatialPolygonsDataFrame"`, and return the ZCTAs that intersect a
given metropolitan area as defined by the analyst.

``` r
library(tigris)
library(sp)

# Write function to get ZCTAs for a given metro
get_zips <- function(metro_name) {
  zips <- zctas(cb = TRUE)
  metros <- core_based_statistical_areas(cb = TRUE)
  # Subset for specific metro area 
  # (be careful with duplicate cities like "Washington")
  my_metro <- metros[grepl(sprintf("^%s", metro_name), 
                           metros$NAME, ignore.case = TRUE), ]
  # Find all ZCTAs that intersect the metro boundary
  metro_zips <- over(my_metro, zips, returnList = TRUE)[[1]]
  my_zips <- zips[zips$ZCTA5CE10 %in% metro_zips$ZCTA5CE10, ]
  # Return those ZCTAs
  return(my_zips)
}
```

The analyst can then fetch ZCTA geography for a given metropolitan area,
which in this example will be Dallas-Fort Worth, Texas, and merge the
IRS income data to it with `geo_join()`. For visualization, this example
uses the [*tmap*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=tmap) package
[@Tennekes2015], an excellent option for creating high-quality
cartographic products in R, to create a choropleth map. To provide
spatial reference to the Census tracts on the map, major roads obtained
with the `primary_roads()` function in *tigris* are added to the map as
well.

``` r
library(tmap)
rds <- primary_roads()
dfw <- get_zips("Dallas")
dfw_merged <- geo_join(dfw, df, "ZCTA5CE10", "zip_str")
tm_shape(dfw_merged, projection = "+init=epsg:26914") + 
  tm_fill("incpr", style = "quantile", n = 7, palette = "Greens", title = "") + 
  tm_shape(rds, projection = "+init=epsg:26914") + 
  tm_lines(col = "darkgrey") + 
  tm_layout(bg.color = "ivory", 
            title = "Average income by zip code \n(in $1000s US), Dallas-Fort Worth", 
            title.position = c("right", "top"), title.size = 1.1, 
            legend.position = c(0.85, 0), legend.text.size = 0.75, 
            legend.width = 0.2) + 
  tm_credits("Data source: US Internal Revenue Service", 
            position = c(0.002, 0.002))
```

![Figure 8: Map of average reported total income to the Internal Revenue
Service by zip code for the Dallas-Fort Worth, Texas metropolitan area
in 2013, created with tmap.](zip_income.png){#figure:zip_income
width="100%" alt="graphic without alt text"}

Given that both geographic data obtained through *tigris* and the IRS
data are available for the entire country, an R developer could extend
this example and create a web application that generates interactive
income maps based on user input with the
[*shiny*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=shiny) package [@shiny3].
Below is an example of such an application, which is viewable online at
<http://walkerke.shinyapps.io/tigris-zip-income>; the code for the
application can be viewed at
<http://github.com/walkerke/tigris-zip-income>.

![Figure 9: Interactive Leaflet map of average reported total income to
the Internal Revenue Service by zip code for the Los Angeles, California
metropolitan area in 2013, built in
Shiny.](zip_income_shiny.png){#figure:zip_income_shiny width="100%" alt="graphic without alt text"}

In the application, the user selects a metropolitan area from the
drop-down menu, instructing the Shiny server to generate an interactive
choropleth map of average reported total income by zip code from the
IRS, as in the above example, but in this instance using the
[*leaflet*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=leaflet) package
[@leaflet2]. The application uses the same process described above for
the static map to subset the data; in this instance, however, the Shiny
server makes these computations on-the-fly in response to user input. In
the figure, the Los Angeles, California metropolitan area is selected;
however, all metropolitan areas in the United States are available to
users of the application. While both of these cartographic examples
require considerable R infrastructure to process the data and ultimately
create the visualizations, *tigris* plays a key role in each by
providing direct access to reliable spatial data programmatically from
R.

# Conclusion

This paper has summarized the functionality of the *tigris* package for
retrieving and working with shapefiles from the United States Census
Bureau. Access to high-quality spatial data is essential for the
geospatial analyst, but can be difficult to access. For R users working
on projects that can benefit from United States Census Bureau data,
*tigris* provides direct access to the Census Bureau's TIGER/Line and
cartographic boundary files using a simple and consistent API. In turn,
tasks such as looking up FIPS codes to identify the correct datasets to
download or combining several Census datasets are reduced to a few lines
of R code in *tigris*.

More significantly, the utility of *tigris* is exemplified when included
in a larger geospatial project that incorporates US Census data, such as
the static and interactive maps of IRS data included in this article.
These examples illustrate some clear advantages that R has over
traditional desktop Geographic Information Systems software for
geographic analysis and visualization. To create an interactive
application showing IRS data by zip code as in Figure 9, a GIS analyst
would traditionally have to search out and download the data from the
web; load it into a desktop GIS for merging and calculating new columns;
publish the data to a server; and build the application with a web
mapping client and web application framework, often requiring several
software applications. As shown in this article, this entire process now
can take place inside of an R script, helping ensure quality and
reproducibility. For projects that require US Census Bureau geographic
data, *tigris* aims to fit well within these types of workflows.
