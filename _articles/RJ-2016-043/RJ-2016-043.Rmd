title: 'tigris: An R Package to Access and Work with Geographic Data from the US Census
  Bureau'
abstract: TIGER/Line shapefiles from the United States Census Bureau are commonly
  used for the mapping and analysis of US demographic trends. The tigris package provides
  a uniform interface for R users to download and work with these shapefiles. Functions
  in tigris allow R users to request Census geographic datasets using familiar geographic
  identifiers and return those datasets as objects of class "Spatial*DataFrame". In
  turn, tigris ensures consistent and high-quality spatial data for R usersâ€™ cartographic
  and spatial analysis projects that involve US Census data. This article provides
  an overview of the functionality of the tigris package, and concludes with an applied
  example of a geospatial workflow using data retrieved with tigris.
