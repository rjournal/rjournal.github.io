title: Creating and Deploying an Application with (R)Excel and R
abstract: We present some ways of using R in Excel and build an example application
  using the package rpart. Starting with simple interactive use of rpart in Excel,
  we eventually package the code into an Excel-based application, hiding all details
  (including R itself) from the end user. In the end, our application implements a
  service-oriented architecture (SOA) with a clean separation of presentation and
  computation layer.
