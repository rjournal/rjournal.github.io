title: 'condSURV: An R Package for the Estimation of the Conditional Survival Function
  for Ordered Multivariate Failure Time Data'
abstract: One major goal in clinical applications of time-to-event data is the estimation
  of survival with censored data. The usual nonparametric estimator of the survival
  function is the time-honored Kaplan-Meier product-limit estimator. Though this estimator
  has been implemented in several R packages, the development of the condSURV R package
  has been motivated by recent contributions that allow the estimation of the survival
  function for ordered multivariate failure time data. The condSURV package provides
  three different approaches all based on the Kaplan-Meier estimator. In one of these
  approaches these quantities are estimated conditionally on current or past covariate
  measures. Illustration of the software usage is included using real data.
