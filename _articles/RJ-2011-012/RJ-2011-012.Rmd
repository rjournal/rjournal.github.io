title: 'glm2: Fitting Generalized Linear Models with Convergence Problems'
abstract: The R function glm uses step-halving to deal with certain types of convergence
  problems when using iteratively reweighted least squares to fit a generalized linear
  model. This works well in some circumstances but non-convergence remains a possibility,
  particularly with a non-standard link function. In some cases this is because step-halving
  is never invoked, despite a lack of convergence. In other cases step-halving is
  invoked but is unable to induce convergence. One remedy is to impose a stricter
  form of step-halving than is currently available in glm, so that the deviance is
  forced to decrease in every iteration. This has been implemented in the glm2 function
  available in the glm2 package. Aside from a modified computational algorithm, glm2
  operates in exactly the same way as glm and provides improved convergence properties.
  These improvements are illustrated here with an identity link Poisson model, but
  are also relevant in other contexts.
