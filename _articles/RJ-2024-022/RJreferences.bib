   abstract = {The main way of analyzing biological sequences is by comparing and aligning them to each other. It remains difficult, however, to compare modern multi-billionbase DNA data sets. The difficulty is caused by the nonuniform (oligo)nucleotide composition of these sequences, rather than their size per se. To solve this problem, we modified the standard seed-and-extend approach (e.g., BLAST) to use adaptive seeds. Adaptive seeds are matches that are chosen based on their rareness, instead of using fixed-length matches. This method guarantees that the number of matches, and thus the running time, increases linearly, instead of quadratically, with sequence length. LAST, our open source implementation of adaptive seeds, enables fast and sensitive comparison of large sequences with arbitrarily nonuniform composition.},

   abstract = {Profile hidden Markov models (profile HMMs) and probabilistic inference methods have made important contributions to the theory of sequence database homology search. However, practical use of profile HMM methods has been hindered by the computational expense of existing software implementations. Here I describe an acceleration heuristic for profile HMMs, the "multiple segment Viterbi" (MSV) algorithm. The MSV algorithm computes an optimal sum of multiple ungapped local alignment segments using a striped vector-parallel approach previously described for fast Smith/Waterman alignment. MSV scores follow the same statistical distribution as gapped optimal local alignment scores, allowing rapid evaluation of significance of an MSV score and thus facilitating its use as a heuristic filter. I also describe a 20-fold acceleration of the standard profile HMM Forward/Backward algorithms using a method I call "sparse rescaling". These methods are assembled in a pipeline in which high-scoring MSV hits are passed on for reanalysis with the full HMM Forward/Backward algorithm. This accelerated pipeline is implemented in the freely available HMMER3 software package. Performance benchmarks show that the use of the heuristic MSV filter sacrifices negligible sensitivity compared to unaccelerated profile HMM searches. HMMER3 is substantially more sensitive and 100- to 1000-fold faster than HMMER2. HMMER3 is now about as fast as BLAST for protein searches.},

Our analyses show that these species exhibit many mosaic genomic features of lobe- and ray-finned fishes.

Transcriptome analyses confirm the homology between the lung and swim bladder and reveal the presence of functional lung-related genes in early ray-finned fishes. Furthermore, we functionally validate the essential role of a jawed vertebrate highly conserved element for cardiovascular development. Our results imply the ancestors of jawed vertebrates already had the potential gene networks for cardio-respiratory systems supporting air breathing.},

   journal = {BMC Genomics},
   volume = {21},

   pages = {741},
   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Finding orthologs remains an important bottleneck in comparative genomics analyses. While the authors of software for the quick comparison of protein sequences evaluate the speed of their software and compare their results against the most usual software for the task, it is not common for them to evaluate their software for more particular uses, such as finding orthologs as reciprocal best hits (RBH). Here we compared RBH results obtained using software that runs faster than blastp. Namely, lastal, diamond, and MMseqs2. RESULTS: We found that lastal required the least time to produce results. However, it yielded fewer results than any other program when comparing the proteins encoded by evolutionarily distant genomes. The program producing the most similar number of RBH to blastp was diamond ran with the "ultra-sensitive" option. However, this option was diamond's slowest, with the "very-sensitive" option offering the best balance between speed and RBH results. The speeding up of the programs was much more evident when dealing with eukaryotic genomes, which code for more numerous proteins. For example, lastal took a median of approx. 1.5% of the blastp time to run with bacterial proteomes and 0.6% with eukaryotic ones, while diamond with the very-sensitive option took 7.4% and 5.2%, respectively. Though estimated error rates were very similar among the RBH obtained with all programs, RBH obtained with MMseqs2 had the lowest error rates among the programs tested. CONCLUSIONS: The fast algorithms for pairwise protein comparison produced results very similar to blast in a fraction of the time, with diamond offering the best compromise in speed, sensitivity and quality, as long as a sensitivity option, other than the default, was chosen.},

   abstract = {MOTIVATION: Over the last decades, vast numbers of sequences were deposited in public databases. Bioinformatics tools allow homology and consequently functional inference for these sequences. New profile-based homology search tools have been introduced, allowing reliable detection of remote homologs, but have not been systematically benchmarked. To provide such a comparison, which can guide bioinformatics workflows, we extend and apply our previously developed benchmark approach to evaluate the 'next generation' of profile-based approaches, including CS-BLAST, HHSEARCH and PHMMER, in comparison with the non-profile based search tools NCBI-BLAST, USEARCH, UBLAST and FASTA. METHOD: We generated challenging benchmark datasets based on protein domain architectures within either the PFAM + Clan, SCOP/Superfamily or CATH/Gene3D domain definition schemes. From each dataset, homologous and non-homologous protein pairs were aligned using each tool, and standard performance metrics calculated. We further measured congruence of domain architecture assignments in the three domain databases. RESULTS: CSBLAST and PHMMER had overall highest accuracy. FASTA, UBLAST and USEARCH showed large trade-offs of accuracy for speed optimization. CONCLUSION: Profile methods are superior at inferring remote homologs but the difference in accuracy between methods is relatively small. PHMMER and CSBLAST stand out with the highest accuracy, yet still at a reasonable computational cost. Additionally, we show that less than 0.1% of Swiss-Prot protein pairs considered homologous by one database are considered non-homologous by another, implying that these classifications represent equivalent underlying biological phenomena, differing mostly in coverage and granularity.

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Numerous tools exist for biological sequence comparisons and search. One case of particular interest for immunologists is finding matches for linear peptide T cell epitopes, typically between 8 and 15 residues in length, in a large set of protein sequences. Both to find exact matches or matches that account for residue substitutions. The utility of such tools is critical in applications ranging from identifying conservation across viral epitopes, identifying putative epitope targets for allergens, and finding matches for cancer-associated neoepitopes to examine the role of tolerance in tumor recognition. RESULTS: We defined a set of benchmarks that reflect the different practical applications of short peptide sequence matching. We evaluated a suite of existing methods for speed and recall and developed a new tool, PEPMatch. The tool uses a deterministic k-mer mapping algorithm that preprocesses proteomes before searching, achieving a 50-fold increase in speed over methods such as the Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST) without compromising recall. PEPMatch's code and benchmark datasets are publicly available. CONCLUSIONS: PEPMatch offers significant speed and recall advantages for peptide sequence matching. While it is of immediate utility for immunologists, the developed benchmarking framework also provides a standard against which future tools can be evaluated for improvements.

Development of the SCOP 1.x series concluded with SCOP 1.75. The ASTRAL compendium provides several databases and tools to aid in the analysis of the protein structures classified in SCOP, particularly through the use of their sequences. SCOPe extends version 1.75 of the SCOP database, using automated curation methods to classify many structures released since SCOP 1.75. We have rigorously benchmarked our automated methods to ensure that they are as accurate as manual curation, though there are many proteins to which our methods cannot be applied. SCOPe is also partially manually curated to correct some errors in SCOP. SCOPe aims to be backward compatible with SCOP, providing the same parseable files and a history of changes between all stable SCOP and SCOPe releases. SCOPe also incorporates and updates the ASTRAL database. The latest release of SCOPe, 2.03, contains 59 514 Protein Data Bank (PDB) entries, increasing the number of structures classified in SCOP by 55% and including more than 65% of the protein structures in the PDB.},

We demonstrate Rsubread's ability to detect exon-exon junctions de novo and to quantify expression at the level of either genes, exons or exon junctions. The resulting read counts can be input directly into a wide range of downstream statistical analyses using other Bioconductor packages. Using SEQC data and simulations, we compare Rsubread to TopHat2, STAR and HTSeq as well as to counting functions in the Bioconductor infrastructure packages. We consider the performance of these tools on the combined quantification task starting from raw sequence reads through to summary counts, and in particular evaluate the performance of different combinations of alignment and counting algorithms. We show that Rsubread is faster and uses less memory than competitor tools and produces read count summaries that more accurately correlate with true values.},

   abstract = {MOTIVATION: Insertions and deletions (indels) of short DNA segments, along with substitutions, are the most frequent molecular evolutionary events. Indels were shown to affect numerous macro-evolutionary processes. Because indels may span multiple positions, their impact is a product of both their rate and their length distribution. An accurate inference of indel-length distribution is important for multiple evolutionary and bioinformatics applications, most notably for alignment software. Previous studies counted the number of continuous gap characters in alignments to determine the best-fitting length distribution. However, gap-counting methods are not statistically rigorous, as gap blocks are not synonymous with indels. Furthermore, such methods rely on alignments that regularly contain errors and are biased due to the assumption of alignment methods that indels lengths follow a geometric distribution. RESULTS: We aimed to determine which indel-length distribution best characterizes alignments using statistical rigorous methodologies. To this end, we reduced the alignment bias using a machine-learning algorithm and applied an Approximate Bayesian Computation methodology for model selection. Moreover, we developed a novel method to test if current indel models provide an adequate representation of the evolutionary process. We found that the best-fitting model varies among alignments, with a Zipf length distribution fitting the vast majority of them.
