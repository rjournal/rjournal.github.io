title: 'stringr: modern, consistent string processing'
abstract: String processing is not glamorous, but it is frequently used in data cleaning
  and preparation. The existing string functions in R are powerful, but not friendly.
  To remedy this, the stringr package provides string functions that are simpler and
  more consistent, and also fixes some functionality that R is missing compared to
  other programming languages.
