title: 'SIMEXBoost: An R package for Analysis of High-Dimensional Error-Prone Data
  Based on Boosting Method'
abstract: ' Boosting is a powerful statistical learning method. Its key feature is
  the ability to derive a strong learner from simple yet weak learners by iteratively
  updating the learning results. Moreover, boosting algorithms have been employed
  to do variable selection and estimation for regression models. However, measurement
  error usually appears in covariates. Ignoring measurement error can lead to biased
  estimates and wrong inferences. To the best of our knowledge, few packages have
  been developed to address measurement error and variable selection simultaneously
  by using boosting algorithms. In this paper, we introduce an R package [SIMEXBoost](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=SIMEXBoost),
  which covers some widely used regression models and applies the simulation and extrapolation
  method to deal with measurement error effects. Moreover, the package [SIMEXBoost](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=SIMEXBoost)
  enables us to do variable selection and estimation for high-dimensional data under
  various regression models. To assess the performance and illustrate the features
  of the package, we conduct numerical studies. '
