title: Bayesian Testing, Variable Selection and Model Averaging in Linear Models using
  R with BayesVarSel
abstract: In this paper, objective Bayesian methods for hypothesis testing and variable
  selection in linear models are considered. The focus is on BayesVarSel, an R package
  that computes posterior probabilities of hypotheses/models and provides a suite
  of tools to properly summarize the results. We introduce the usage of specific functions
  to compute several types of model averaging estimations and predictions weighted
  by posterior probabilities. BayesVarSel contains exact algorithms to perform fast
  computations in problems of small to moderate size and heuristic sampling methods
  to solve large problems. We illustrate the functionalities of the package with several
  data examples.
