title: 'dad: an R Package for Visualisation, Classification and Discrimination of
  Multivariate Groups Modelled by their Densities'
abstract: 'Multidimensional scaling (MDS), hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA), and
  discriminant analysis (DA) are classical techniques which deal with data made of
  n individuals and p variables. When the individuals are divided into T groups, the
  R package dad associates with each group a multivariate probability density function
  and then carries out these techniques on the densities, which are estimated by the
  data under consideration. These techniques are based on distance measures between
  densities: chi-square, Hellinger, Jeffreys, Jensen-Shannon, and L p for discrete
  densities, Hellinger , Jeffreys, L2 , and 2-Wasserstein for Gaussian densities,
  and L2 for numeric non-Gaussian densities estimated by the Gaussian kernel method.
  Practical methods help the user to give meaning to the outputs in the context of
  MDS and HCA and to look for an optimal prediction in the context of DA based on
  the one-leave-out misclassification ratio. Some functions for data management or
  basic statistics calculations on groups are annexed.'
