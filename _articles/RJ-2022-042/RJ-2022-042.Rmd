title: 'WLinfer: Statistical Inference for Weighted Lindley Distribution'
abstract: ' New distributions are still being suggested for better fitting of a distribution
  to data, as it is one of the most fundamental problems in terms of the parametric
  approach. One of such is weighted Lindley (WL) distribution [@ghitany:2011]. Even
  though WL distribution has become increasingly popular as a possible alternative
  to traditional distributions such as gamma and log normal distributions, fitting
  it to data has rarely been addressed in existing R packages. This is the reason
  we present the [WLinfer](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=WLinfer) package that
  implements overall statistical inference for WL distribution. In particular, WLinfer
  enables one to conduct the goodness of fit test, point estimation, bias correction,
  interval estimation, and the likelihood ratio test simply with the `WL` function
  which is at the core of this package. To assist users who are unfamiliar with WL
  distribution, we present a brief review followed by an illustrative example with
  R codes. '
