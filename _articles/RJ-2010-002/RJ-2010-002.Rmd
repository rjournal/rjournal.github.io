title: 'Online Reproducible Research: An Application to Multivariate Analysis of Bacterial
  DNA Fingerprint Data'
abstract: This paper presents an example of online reproducible multivariate data
  analysis. This example is based on a web page providing an online computing facility
  on a server. HTML forms contain editable R code snippets that can be executed in
  any web browser thanks to the Rweb software. The example is based on the multivariate
  analysis of DNA fingerprints of the internal bacterial flora of the poultry red
  mite Dermanyssus gallinae. Several multivariate data analysis methods from the ade4
  package are used to compare the fingerprints of mite pools coming from various poultry
  farms. All the computations and graphical displays can be redone interactively and
  further explored online, using only a web browser. Statistical methods are detailed
  in the duality diagram framework, and a discussion about online reproducibility
  is initiated.
