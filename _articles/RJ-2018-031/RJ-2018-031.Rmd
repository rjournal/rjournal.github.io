title: 'SetMethods: an Add-on R Package for Advanced QCA'
abstract: This article presents the functionalities of the R package SetMethods, aimed
  at performing advanced set-theoretic analyses. This includes functions for performing
  set-theoretic multi-method research, set-theoretic theory evaluation, Enhanced Standard
  Analysis, diagnosing the impact of temporal, spatial, or substantive clusterings
  of the data on the results obtained via Qualitative Com parative Analysis (QCA),
  indirect calibration, and visualising QCA results via XY plots or radar charts.
  Each functionality is presented in turn, the conceptual idea and the logic behind
  the procedure being first summarized, and afterwards illustrated with data from
  Schneider et al. (2010).
