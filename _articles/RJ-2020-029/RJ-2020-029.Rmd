title: Provenance of Râ€™s Gradient Optimizers
abstract: ' Gradient optimization methods (function minimizers) are well-represented
  in both the base and package universe of R (R Core Team, 2019). However, some of
  the methods and the codes developed from them were published before standards for
  hardware and software were established, in particular the IEEE arithmetic (IEEE,
  1985). There have been cases of unexpected behaviour or outright errors, and these
  are the focus of the histoRicalg project. A summary history of some of the tools
  in R for gradient optimization methods is presented to give perspective on such
  methods and the occasions where they could be used effectively.'
