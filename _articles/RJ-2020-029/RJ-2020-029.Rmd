title: Provenance of R's Gradient Optimizers
abstract: Gradient optimization methods (function minimizers) are well-represented
  in both the base and package universe of R [@citeR]. However, some of the methods
  and the codes developed from them were published before standards for hardware and
  software were established, in particular the IEEE arithmetic [@IEEE754A]. There
  have been cases of unexpected behaviour or outright errors, and these are the focus
  of the **histoRicalg** project. A summary history of some of the tools in R for
  gradient optimization methods is presented to give perspective on such methods and
  the occasions where they could be used effectively.

# The task

Ignoring exogenous data (assume that it is supplied when needed), our
problem is to find

$$argmin{_x}{f(x)}$$

where $x$ is our set of $n$ parameters and $f()$ is a scalar real
function of those parameters. The gradient of $f(x)$ is the vector
valued function
$$g(x) = \partial{f(x)}/\partial{x}.$$
The Hessian of $f(x)$ is the matrix of second partial derivatives
$$H(x) = \partial^2{f(x)}/\partial{x^2}.$$

We will be considering methods for this problem where a gradient can be
supplied, though many of the R tools will use a numerical approximation
if needed.

# General approaches

The so-called **Newton** method tries to find $x$ that satisfies the
first order conditions for an extremum, namely,

$$H(x) \delta = - g(x)$$

and then updates $x$ to $(x + \delta)$.

The main objections to this approach are

-   the Hessian is generally expensive to compute, though because an
    accurate Hessian is so useful, I strongly recommend that workers
    examine whether it can be computed in a reasonable way;
-   it is necessary to apply safeguards on the computations and the size
    of $\delta$ to avoid cases where the Hessian is near singular,
    poorly computed, or the assumptions of the method are violated.

There are four main approaches to simplifying the Newton method:

-   The **variable metric** or **quasi-Newton** methods use clever ways
    to improve an approximate Hessian or Hessian inverse while finding
    lower points $x$ on the function surface, using only function and
    gradient values computed in the process.
-   Truncated Newton methods use a linear conjugate gradient method to
    inexactly solve the Newton equations, thereby reducing memory
    requirements.
-   Conjugate gradient methods aim to search \"downhill\" for better
    points on the functional surface using only recent gradient
    information. The traditional first search direction is that of
    steepest descents, namely, $- g$, the negative gradient. After a
    line search selects a suitable step size, we have a new point, a new
    function value that is lower than the initial point, and a new
    gradient. Using this information and possibly the last search
    direction, we compute a new search direction that is somehow
    \"conjugate\" to the previous one. For a problem with $n$
    parameters, of course, there are only $n$ independent search
    directions, so we need to restart the procedure on or before that
    step. Indeed there are a number of strategies for deciding when to
    restart the conjugacy cycle. And, of course, there are a number of
    choices for updating the search direction and for performing the
    line search.
-   Limited Memory BFGS methods use reduced memory approaches to
    variable metric methods, but can also be thought of as extending
    conjugate gradients methods by using several rather than the two
    most recent gradients.

# The histoRicalg project

The R Consortium awarded some modest funding for **histoRicalg**, a
project to document and transfer knowledge of some older algorithms used
by R and by other computational systems. These older codes are mainly in
Fortran, but some are in C, with the original implementations possibly
in other programming languages. This effort was prompted by finding some
apparent bugs in codes, which could be either from the original programs
or else the implementations. Two examples in particular -- in `nlm()`
and in `optim–L-BFGS-B` -- gave motivation for the project. We welcome
interest and participation, and have a project repository
<https://gitlab.com/nashjc/histoRicalg>, where several aspects of this
work are in various stages of completion.

The function `optim()` in base-R has three of the optimizers from the
1990 edition of Compact Numerical Methods [@jncnm79], abbreviated CNM
henceforth. Given the dates of their conception, these are an obvious
focus for **histoRicalg**. The direct-search Nelder-Mead method
[@NelderMead65] is in fact the default solver i.e., it uses
`method="Nelder-Mead"` in the `optim()` call and does not require a
gradient routine to be supplied. In fact, Nelder-Mead will be used even
if a gradient routine is included unless some other method is suggested.
The choice if `method="BFGS"` is the variable metric method of
@Fletcher70. The third choice from CNM is `method="CG"` for conjugate
gradients, which is a combination of several similar approaches.

In this article on the provenance of the methods, the details will be
discussed only in general terms. However, it is critical to get those
details right.

# Provenance of the R optim--BFGS solver

If the source code for base R is in a directory that is named R-X.Y.Z
(in my case 3.5.1 when this vignette was started) then the calling
routine for `optim()` is `src/library/stats/R/optim.R`, but this uses
the `.External2` method to call `src/library/stats/src/optim.c`, where
the function `vmmin` is called. However, the source for `vmmin` is in
`src/appl/optim.c`. I will venture that having two files of the same
name in different directories is tempting an error.

I will use `optim–BFGS` when using the call `method="BFGS"` in
`optim()`, and similar abbreviations for the other methods. To use
`optim–BFGS`, the relevant code is a C routine `vmmin`. In
`src/appl/optim.c`, above this routine is the comment

``` r
{,comment}
/*  BFGS variable-metric method, based on Pascal code
in J.C. Nash, `Compact Numerical Methods for Computers', 2nd edition,
converted by p2c then re-crafted by B.D. Ripley */
```

As author of this work, I can say that the code used is Algorithm 21 of
[@jncnm79]. In the First Edition, this was a step-and-description code
which was replaced by Turbo Pascal in the Second Edition. The methods
were worked out mainly on a Data General Nova which had partitions of
between 3.5 K and 8 K bytes accessible via a 10 character per second
teletype. The floating point available had a 24 bit mantissa, in a
single level of precision with (as I recall) no guard digit. Programming
was in a fairly early and simple form of BASIC.

This machine was at Agriculture Canada. In the late 1970s, it was
replaced with a Data General Eclipse, but largely the facilities were
the same, except the floating point went to 6 hexadecimal digits with no
guard digit. I also implemented some codes on HP 9830 and Tektronix 4051
\"programmable calculators\". A Fortran translation was made as NASHLIB,
which ran mainly on IBM System 360 class computers, but also was tested
at least partially on Univac 1108, ICL 1906A and Xerox-Honeywell CP-6
machines. The codes were distributed as Fortran source code. See
https://gams.nist.gov/cgi-bin/serve.cgi/Package/NASHLIB. I have been
informed that the servers supporting this link will not be replaced when
they fail.

NASHLIB dates from the 1979-1981 period, though the methods were
developed in the mid-1970s at Agriculture Canada to support economic
modelling. In 1975, I received an invitation (from Brian Ford) to
collaborate with the Numerical Algorithms Group in Oxford, and
Agriculture Canada generously allowed me two 6-week periods to do so.
During the second of these, in the tail end of the hurricane of January
1976, I drove to Dundee to meet Roger Fletcher. He took an interest in
the concept of a program that used minimal memory. We found a printout
of the Fortran for the method in [@Fletcher70], and with a ruler and
pencil, Roger and I scratched out the lines of code that were not
strictly needed. As I recall, the main deletion was the cubic
interpolation line search. The resulting method simply used backtracking
with an acceptable point condition.

On my return to Ottawa, I coded the method in BASIC and made two small
changes:

-   I managed to re-use one vector, thereby reducing the storage
    requirement to a square matrix and five vectors of length $n$, the
    number of parameters.
-   The very short floating point precision seemed to give early
    termination on some problems. Often this was due to failure of the
    update of the approximate inverse Hessian when an intermediate
    quantity indicated the approximate Hessian was not positive
    definite. As a quick and dirty fix, I simply checked if

the current search was a steepest descent. If so, then the method is
terminated. If not, the inverse Hessian approximation is reset to the
unit matrix and the cycle restarted. This \"quick fix\" has, of course,
become permanent. My experience over the years suggests it is a
reasonable compromise, but the possibility of better choices is still
open.

# Evolution of the code

Considering the simplicity of the method, it is surprising to me how
robust and efficient it has shown itself to be over the last four
decades.

The code does allow of some variations:

-   the organization of some of the calculations may have an influence
    on outcomes. There are opportunities for accumulation of inner
    products, and the update of the inverse Hessian approximation
    involves subtractions, so digit cancellation could be an issue.
-   tolerances for termination, for the \"acceptable point\" (Armijo)
    condition, and other settings could be changed. However, I have
    found the original settings seem to work as well or better than
    other choices I have tried.

In the mid-1980s, the BASIC code was extended to allow for masks (fixed
parameters) and bounds (or box) constraints on the parameters
[@jnmws87]. This adds about 50% more code, as well as vector storage for
the constraints and indices to manage them (essentially $3*n$), but does
permit a much wider variety of problems to be solved. Even for
unconstrained problems that may have difficult properties, imposing
loose bounds can prevent extreme steps in the parameters. To add this
capability to R, I put the package `Rvmmin` on CRAN in 2011 [@p-Rvmmin].
This code is, as of 2018, part of a new `optimx` (@JNRV11, @NashBest14)
package on CRAN. It is entirely written in R.

# Extensions and related codes

There are other R packages with related capability. In particular,
`ucminf` [@p-ucminf] is based on the Fortran code of @Nielsen2000. This
appears to use a very similar algorithm to `optim–BFGS`, but employs a
more sophisticated line search. This package does not, however, allow
for constraints in the form of bounds or masks.

The approximate inverse Hessian could also be saved and used to provide
some estimates of parameter dispersion. Clearly, the use of a steepest
descents direction for the final line search in `Rvmmin` before
termination means that the **penultimate** approximation must be saved.
In practice, I have found the approximate inverse Hessian bears little
or no resemblance to the actual Hessian. This may be because the
construction of the approximation maintains the positive definite
condition. It is an open question whether the approximation has any
utility.

Package *mize* [@Melville17] offers some options to build a gradient
minimizer and could possibly allow some algorithmic comparisons to be
made, but I have not had the time to delve into this.

Rather more sophisticated codes are part of base R in `nlm()` and
`nlminb()`. The former is a polyalgorithm of quasi-Newton type for
unconstrained problems [@Schnabel1985]. The latter allows bounds
constraints and is drawn from the PORT library [@Fox1997] code by
@Gay1990, but there are a number of common ideas in both methods. For
users, these two functions generally work well with the default settings
of their controls. This is fortunate, as even though I am fairly
experienced with such programs, I hesitate to play with the numerous
control parameters.

To underline this last sentence, there was a thread on the R-help
mailing list in 2010 (see, for example,
<https://stat.ethz.ch/pipermail/r-help/2010-July/245182.html>) noting
that the default behaviour of `nlminb()` at that time was to assume a
positive objective function such as a sum of squares. Thus the function
would terminate if a non-positive evaluation occurred. This has since
been corrected, but was present in R for some years, possibly resulting
in erroneous results being published.

# Provenance of the R optim--CG and related solvers

The original Algorithm 22 of CNM which was converted to C and included
in R as the `method="CG"` choice for `optim()` by Brian Ripley is an
approach that has never felt quite right to me. And I am the author! It
offers three different search direction updates using the `type` element
of the `control` list. The default is `type=1` for the Fletcher-Reeves
update [@FletReeves64], with 2 for Polak--Ribiere [@Polak1969] and 3 for
Beale--Sorenson [@Sorenson1969], [@Beale1972].

In the mid-1980's I updated the CG code (in BASIC) to handle bounds and
masks. Then in 2009 I incorporated the Yuan/Dai [@Dai01] search
direction update that melds the different formulas used in `optim–CG`.
This gives a remarkably effective method that retains a surprisingly
short code, and entirely in R, with a version that handles bounds and
masks. This is package `Rcgmin` [@p-Rcgmin].

There has been a flurry of work on CG-related optimizers in the last
decade or so, in particular associated with Hager and Zhang. See
[@Hager2006a] and [@Hager2006b]. I have experimentally wrapped the
`CG-Descent` code, but as yet do not feel the program is ready for
production release. However, collaboration on this and related codes I
have been exploring is welcome.

# Provenance of the R optim--L-BFGS-B and related solvers

The base-R code `lbfgsb.c` (at the time of writing in R-3.5.2/src/appl/)
is commented:

``` r
/* l-bfgs-b.f -- translated by f2c (version 19991025).

  From ?optim:
  The code for method ‘"L-BFGS-B"’ is based on Fortran code by Zhu,
  Byrd, Lu-Chen and Nocedal obtained from Netlib (file 'opt/lbfgs_bcm.shar')

  The Fortran files contained no copyright information.

  Byrd, R. H., Lu, P., Nocedal, J. and Zhu, C.  (1995) A limited
  memory algorithm for bound constrained optimization.
  \emph{SIAM J. Scientific Computing}, \bold{16}, 1190--1208.
*/
```

The paper [@Byrd1995] builds on [@Lu94limitedmemory]. There have been a
number of other workers who have followed-up on this work, but R code
and packages seem to have largely stayed with codes derived from these
original papers. Though the date of the paper is 1995, the ideas it
embodies were around for a decade and a half at least, in particular in
[@Nocedal80] and [@LiuN89]. The definitive Fortran code was published as
[@Zhu1997LBFGS]. This is available as `toms/778.zip` on
<http://www.netlib.org>.

Besides the ACM TOMS code, there are two related codes from the
Northwestern team on NETLIB:

-   <http://netlib.org/opt/lbfgs_um.shar> is for unconstrained
    minimization, while
-   <http://netlib.org/opt/lbfgs_bcm.shar> handles bounds constrained
    problems.

To these are attached references [@LiuN89] and [@Byrd1995] respectively,
most likely reflecting the effort required to implement the constraints.

The unconstrained code has been converted to C under the leadership of
Naoaki Okazaki (see <http://www.chokkan.org/software/liblbfgs/>, or the
fork at <https://github.com/MIRTK/LBFGS>). This has been wrapped for R
as the `lbfgs` package [@Coppola2014]. I have included this as one of
the solvers callable from package `optimx`.

A side-by-side comparison of the main subroutines in the two downloads
from Netlib (`toms` and `opt`) unfortunately shows a lot of differences.
I have not tried to determine if these affect performance or are simply
cosmetic.

More seriously perhaps, there were some deficiencies in the code(s), and
in 2011 Nocedal's team published a Fortran code with some corrections
[@Morales2011]. Since the R code in C predates this by many years, I
prepared package `lbfgsb3` to wrap the Fortran code. However, I did not
discover any test cases where the `optim–L-BFGS-B` and `lbfgsb3` gave
different output different, though I confess that the tests I ran are
not exhaustive.

In 2016, I was at a Fields Institute optimization conference in Toronto
for the 70th birthday of Andy Conn. By sheer serendipity, Nocedal did
not attend the conference, but sat down next to me at the conference
dinner. When I asked him about the key changes, he said that the most
important one was to fix the computation of the machine precision, which
was not always correct in the 1995 code. Since R gets this number as
`.Machine$double.eps`, the offending code is irrelevant.

Within [@Morales2011], there is also reported an improvement in the
subspace minimization that is applied in cases of bounds constraints. In
the few tests I have applied with bounds constraints, I have yet to see
any substantive differences, but welcome communcation should such be
found.

Using Rcpp (see @DERFRcpp2011 and the Fortran code in package `lbfgs3`,
Matthew Fidler developed package `lbfgsb3c`. As this provides a more
standard call and return than `lbfgsb3`, Fidler and I have unified the
two packages, but are still checking and cleaning the package at the
time of writing.

# Provenance of truncated Newton codes for R

There are (at least) two implementations of truncated Newton methods
available.

`nloptr–tnewton()` is a wrapper of the NLopt truncated Newton method
translated to C and somewhat modified by Steven G. Johnson in the nlopt
project (<https://nlopt.readthedocs.io/en/latest/NLopt_Algorithms/>)
from Fortran code due to Ladislav Luksan
(<http://www.cs.cas.cz/luksan/subroutines.html>). The many layers and
translations make it difficult to unravel the particular details in this
code, and I do not feel confident to provide a competent overview.

`optimx–tn()` and `optimx–tnbc()` are translations from Matlab source of
the Truncated Newton codes of Stephen Nash [@SGN83] that I prepared,
initially in package `Rtnmin`. The code is entirely in R. In
implementing the codes, the principal awkwardness was in making
available to different functions a quite extensive set of variables
relating to the function and gradient. My choice was to use the
`list2env()` function to create an **environment** to hold this data.
Note the survey of truncated Newton methods by Stephen in [@NashTN2000].

# Discussion

This story of some of the function minimizers available to R users is
not finished. There are certain to be related methods in packages or
collections I have overlooked. Moreover, I have not had the time or
energy to fully explore some of the items I have mentioned.
Nevertheless, how codes come about is important to understanding their
strengths and weaknesses and in maintaining them to a level that users
can reliably use them. Such matters were a large consideration for
@nlpor14, but have been more explicitly addressed by **histoRicalg**.

When evaluating such tools, it is important to consider what is wanted.
Personally, I value reliability as more important than speed. By this, I
mean

-   the program will always proceed towards a minimum
-   on termination it will provide useful information on the result
    obtained, such as whether there are good indications of a
    satisfactory result, or that we have halted for some reason such as
    exhausting a computational limit.

\"Speed\" is, of course, desirable, but how this is measured is
debatable. Execution time is notoriously sensitive to hardware and
software environments, as well as to the way functions and gradients are
coded. Number of function and gradient counts is an alternative, since
these computations often are the bottleneck of optimization. However,
there are some methods where the optimization calculations are demanding
either in cycles or memory.

Readers may note that I have highlighted that some codes are written
entirely in R. This allows for customization or in-line use of faster
code, and I have exchanged notes with several workers wanting to speed
up time-consuming optimizations by such ideas. Profiling and debugging
tools are generally quite challenging to use when there are multiple
programming languages involved. All-R code may also be much easier to
read and maintain if well-coded, especially as the programming language
support for \"old\" languages diminishes.

These considerations are, of course, why we have a number of methods,
and why Ravi Varadhan and I prepared the `optimx` package with tools to
allow for comparison of several methods. But please, do use the
comparison for evaluating and choosing a method, not for production
minimization by a \"try everything\" strategy. As new methods are
released, we hope to include them in the set `optimx` can call via a
unified interface that is very close to the `optim()` function. We note
that a somewhat different approach to unifying methods is available in
the ROI package of @p-ROI.
