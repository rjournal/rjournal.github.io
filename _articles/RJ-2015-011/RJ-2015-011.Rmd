title: R as an Environment for Reproducible Analysis of DNA Amplification Experiments
abstract: There is an ever-increasing number of applications, which use quantitative
  PCR (qPCR) or digital PCR (dPCR) to elicit fundamentals of biological processes.
  Moreover, quantitative isother mal amplification (qIA) methods have become more
  prominent in life sciences and point-of-care diagnostics. Additionally, the analysis
  of melting data is essential during many experiments. Several software packages
  have been developed for the analysis of such datasets. In most cases, the software
  is either distributed as closed source software or as monolithic block with little
  freedom to perform highly customized analysis procedures. We argue, among others,
  that R is an excellent foundation for reproducible and transparent data analysis
  in a highly customizable cross-platform environment. However, for novices it is
  often challenging to master R or learn capabilities of the vast number of packages
  available. In the paper, we describe exemplary workflows for the analysis of qPCR,
  qIA or dPCR experiments including the analysis of melting curve data. Our analysis
  relies entirely on R packages available from public repositories. Additionally,
  we provide information related to standardized and reproducible research.
