title: 'investr: An R Package for Inverse Estimation'
abstract: Inverse estimation is a classical and well-known problem in regression.
  In simple terms, it involves the use of an observed value of the response to make
  inference on the corresponding unknown value of the explanatory variable. To our
  knowledge, however, statistical software is somewhat lacking the capabilities for
  analyzing these types of problems. In this paper1 , we introduce investr (which
  stands for inverse estimation in R), a package for solving inverse estimation problems
  in both linear and nonlinear regression models.
