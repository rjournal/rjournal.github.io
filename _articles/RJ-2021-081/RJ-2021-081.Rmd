title: A GUIded tour of Bayesian regression
abstract: This paper presents a Graphical User Interface (GUI) to carry out a Bayesian
  regression analysis in a very friendly environment without any programming skills
  (drag and drop). This paper is designed for teaching and applied purposes at an
  introductory level. Our GUI is based on an interactive web application using shiny
  and libraries from R. We carry out some applications to highlight the potential
  of our GUI for applied researchers and practitioners. In addition, the Help option
  in the main tap panel has an extended version of this paper, where we present the
  basic theory underlying all regression models that we developed in our GUI and more
  applications associated with each model.
