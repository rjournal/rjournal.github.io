title: The gridGraphics Package
abstract: The gridGraphics package provides a function, grid.echo(), that can be used
  to convert a plot drawn with the graphics package to a visually identical plot drawn
  using grid. This conversion provides access to a variety of grid tools for making
  customisations and additions to the plot that are not possible with the graphics
  package.
