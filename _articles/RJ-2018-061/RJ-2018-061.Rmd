title: Geospatial Point Density
abstract: This paper introduces a spatial point density algorithm designed to be explainable,
  meaning ful, and efficient. Originally designed for military applications, this
  technique applies to any spatial point process where there is a desire to clearly
  understand the measurement of density and maintain fidelity of the point locations.
  Typical spatial density plotting algorithms, such as kernel density estimation,
  implement some type of smoothing function that often results in a density value
  that is difficult to interpret. The purpose of the visualization method in this
  paper is to understand spatial point activity density with precision and meaning.
  The temporal tendency of the point process as an extension of the point density
  methodology is also discussed and displayed. Applications include visualization
  and measurement of any type of spatial point process. Visualization techniques integrate
  ggmap with examples from San Diego crime data.
