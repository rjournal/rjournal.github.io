title: 'influence.ME: Tools for Detecting Influential Data in Mixed Effects Models'
abstract: influence.ME provides tools for detecting influential data in mixed effects
  models. The application of these models has become common practice, but the development
  of diagnostic tools has lagged behind. influence.ME calculates standardized measures
  of influential data for the point estimates of generalized mixed effects models,
  such as DFBETAS, Cook’s distance, as well as percentile change and a test for changing
  levels of significance. influence.ME calculates these measures of influence while
  accounting for the nesting structure of the data. The package and measures of influential
  data are introduced, a practical example is given, and strategies for dealing with
  influential data are suggested. The application of mixed effects regression models
  has become common practice in the field of social sciences. As used in the social
  sciences, mixed effects regression models take into account that observations on
  individual respondents are nested within higher-level groups such as schools, classrooms,
  states, and countries (Snijders and Bosker, 1999), and are often referred to as
  multilevel regression models. Despite these models’ increasing popularity, diagnostic
  tools to evaluate fitted models lag behind. We introduce influence.ME (Nieuwenhuis,
  Pelzer, and te Grotenhuis, 2012), an R-package that provides tools for detecting
  influential cases in mixed effects regression models estimated with lme4 (Bates
  and Maechler, 2010). It is commonly accepted that tests for influential data should
  be performed on regression models, especially when estimates are based on a relatively
  small number of cases. However, most existing procedures do not account for the
  nesting structure of the data. As a result, these existing procedures fail to detect
  that higher-level cases may be influential on estimates of variables measured at
  specifically that level. In this paper, we outline the basic rationale on detecting
  influential data, describe standardized measures of influence, provide a practical
  example of the analysis of students in 23 schools, and discuss strategies for dealing
  with influential cases. Testing for influential cases in mixed effects regression
  models is important, because influential data negatively influence the statistical
  fit and generalizability of the model. In social science applications of mixed models
  the testing for influential data is especially important, since these models are
  frequently based on large numbers of observations at the individual level while
  the number of higher level groups is relatively small. For instance, Van der Meer,
  te Grotenhuis, and Pelzer (2010) were unable to find any country-level comparative
  studies involving more than 54 countries. With such a relatively low number of countries,
  a single country can easily be overly influential on the parameter estimates of
  one or more of the country-level variables.
