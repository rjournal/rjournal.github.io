title: Rmetrics - timeDate Package
abstract: The management of time and holidays can prove crucial in applications that
  rely on historical data. A typical example is the aggregation of a data set recorded
  in different time zones and under dif ferent daylight saving time rules. Besides
  the time zone conversion function, which is well supported by default classes in
  R, one might need functions to handle special days or holidays. In this respect,
  the package timeDate enhances default date-time classes in R and brings new functionalities
  to time zone management and the creation of holiday calendars.
