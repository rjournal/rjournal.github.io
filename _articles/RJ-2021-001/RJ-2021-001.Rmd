title: 'The biglasso Package: A Memory- and Computation-Efficient Solver for Lasso
  Model Fitting with Big Data in R'
abstract: ' Penalized regression models such as the lasso have been extensively applied
  to analyzing high-dimensional data sets. However, due to memory limitations, existing
  R packages like [glmnet](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=glmnet) and [ncvreg](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=ncvreg)
  are not capable of fitting lasso-type models for ultrahigh-dimensional, multi-gigabyte
  data sets that are increasingly seen in many areas such as genetics, genomics, biomedical
  imaging, and high-frequency finance. In this research, we implement an R package
  called [biglasso](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=biglasso) that tackles this
  challenge. biglasso utilizes memory-mapped files to store the massive data on the
  disk, only reading data into memory when necessary during model fitting, and is
  thus able to handle out-of-core computation seamlessly. Moreover, it''s equipped
  with newly proposed, more efficient feature screening rules, which substantially
  accelerate the computation. Benchmarking experiments show that our biglasso package,
  as compared to existing popular ones like glmnet, is much more memory- and computation-efficient.
  We further analyze a 36 GB simulated GWAS data set on a laptop with only 16 GB RAM
  to demonstrate the out-of-core computation capability of biglasso in analyzing massive
  data sets that cannot be accommodated by existing R packages. '
