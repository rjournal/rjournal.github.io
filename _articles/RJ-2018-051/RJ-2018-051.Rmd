title: ggplot2 Compatible Quantile-Quantile Plots in R
abstract: Q-Q plots allow us to assess univariate distributional assumptions by comparing
  a set of quantiles from the empirical and the theoretical distributions in the form
  of a scatterplot. To aid in the interpretation of Q-Q plots, reference lines and
  confidence bands are often added. We can also detrend the Q-Q plot so the vertical
  comparisons of interest come into focus. Various implementations of Q-Q plots exist
  in R, but none implements all of these features. qqplotr extends ggplot2 to provide
  a complete implementation of Q-Q plots. This paper introduces the plotting framework
  provided by qqplotr and provides multiple examples of how it can be used.
