title: 'smoof: Single- and Multi-Objective Optimization Test Functions'
abstract: Benchmarking algorithms for optimization problems usually is carried out
  by running the algorithms under consideration on a diverse set of benchmark or test
  functions. A vast variety of test functions was proposed by researchers and is being
  used for investigations in the literature. The smoof package implements a large
  set of test functions and test function generators for both the single and multi-objective
  case in continuous optimization and provides functions to easily create own test
  functions. Moreover, the package offers some additional helper methods, which can
  be used in the context of optimization.
