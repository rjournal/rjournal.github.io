title: 'difNLR: Generalized Logistic Regression Models for DIF and DDF Detection'
abstract: Differential item functioning (DIF) and differential distractor functioning
  (DDF) are impor tant topics in psychometrics, pointing to potential unfairness in
  items with respect to minorities or different social groups. Various methods have
  been proposed to detect these issues. The difNLR R package extends DIF methods currently
  provided in other packages by offering approaches based on generalized logistic
  regression models that account for possible guessing or inattention, and by pro
  viding methods to detect DIF and DDF among ordinal and nominal data. In the current
  paper, we describe implementation of the main functions of the difNLR package, from
  data generation, through the model fitting and hypothesis testing, to graphical
  representation of the results. Finally, we provide a real data example to bring
  the concepts together.
