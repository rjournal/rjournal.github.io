title: 'Validating and Extracting Information from National Identification Numbers
  in R: The Case of Finland and Sweden'
date: '2025-05-20'
abstract: National identification numbers (NIN) and similar identification code systems
  are widely used for uniquely identifying individuals and organizations in Finland,
  Sweden, and many other countries. To increase the general understanding of such
  techniques of identification, openly available methods and tools for NIN analysis
  and validation are needed. The hetu and sweidnumbr R packages provide functions
  for extracting embedded information, checking the validity, and generating random
  but valid numbers in the context of Finnish and Swedish NINs and other identification
  codes. In this article, we demonstrate these functions from both packages and provide
  theoretical context and motivation on the importance of the subject matter. Our
  work contributes to the growing toolkit of standardized methods for computational
  social science research, epidemiology, demographic studies, and other register-based
  inquiries.
