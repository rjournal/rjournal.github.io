title: 'The IDSpatialStats R Package: Quantifying Spatial Dependence of Infectious
  Disease Spread'
abstract: 'Spatial statistics for infectious diseases are important because the spatial
  and temporal scale over which transmission operates determine the dynamics of disease
  spread. Many methods for quantifying the distribution and clustering of spatial
  point patterns have been developed (e.g. K function and pair correlation function)
  and are routinely applied to infectious disease case occurrence data. However, these
  methods do not explicitly account for overlapping chains of transmission and require
  knowledge of the underlying population distribution, which can be limiting when
  analyzing epidemic case occurrence data. Therefore, we developed two novel spatial
  statistics that account for these effects to estimate: 1) the mean of the spatial
  transmission kernel, and 2) the Ï„-statistic, a measure of global clustering based
  on pathogen subtype. We briefly introduce these statistics and show how to implement
  them using the IDSpatialStats R package.'
