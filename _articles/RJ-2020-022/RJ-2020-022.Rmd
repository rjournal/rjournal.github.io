title: 'npordtests: An R Package of Nonparametric Tests for Equality of Location Against
  Ordered Alternatives'
abstract: Ordered alternatives are an important statistical problem in many situation
  such as increased risk of congenital malformation caused by excessive alcohol consumption
  during pregnancy life test experiments, drug-screening studies, dose-finding studies,
  the dose-response studies, age-related response. There are numerous other examples
  of this nature. In this paper, we present the npordtests package to test the equality
  of locations for ordered alternatives. The package includes the Jonckheere Terpstra,
  Beier and Buning’s Adaptive, Modified Jonckheere-Terpstra, Terpstra-Magel, Ferdhiana
  Terpstra-Magel, KTP, S and Gaur’s Gc tests. A simulation study is conducted to determine
  which test is the most appropriate test for which scenario and to suggest it to
  the researchers.
