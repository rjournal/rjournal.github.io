title: 'SimilaR: R Code Clone and Plagiarism Detection'
abstract: Third-party software for assuring source code quality is becoming increasingly
  popular. Tools that evaluate the coverage of unit tests, perform static code analysis,
  or inspect run-time memory use are crucial in the software development life cycle.
  More sophisticated methods allow for performing meta-analyses of large software
  repositories, e.g., to discover abstract topics they relate to or common design
  patterns applied by their developers. They may be useful in gaining a better understanding
  of the component interdependencies, avoiding cloned code as well as detecting plagiarism
  in programming classes. A meaningful measure of similarity of computer programs
  often forms the basis of such tools. While there are a few noteworthy instruments
  for similarity assessment, none of them turns out particularly suitable for analysing
  R code chunks. Existing solutions rely on rather simple techniques and heuristics
  and fail to provide a user with the kind of sensitivity and specificity required
  for working with R scripts. In order to fill this gap, we propose a new algorithm
  based on a Program Dependence Graph, implemented in the SimilaR package. It can
  serve as a tool not only for improving R code quality but also for detecting plagiarism,
  even when it has been masked by applying some obfuscation techniques or imputing
  dead code. We demonstrate its accuracy and efficiency in a real-world case study.
