title: Power and Sample Size for Longitudinal Models in R -- The longpower Package
  and Shiny App
abstract: Longitudinal studies are ubiquitous in medical and clinical research. Sample
  size computations are critical to ensure that these studies are sufficiently powered
  to provide reliable and valid inferences. There are several methodologies for calculating
  sample sizes for longitudinal studies that depend on many considerations including
  the study design features, outcome type and distribution, and proposed analytical
  methods. We briefly review the literature and describe sample size formulas for
  continuous longitudinal data. We then apply the methods using example studies comparing
  treatment versus control groups in randomized trials assessing treatment effect
  on clinical outcomes. We also introduce a Shiny app that we developed to assist
  researchers with obtaining required sample sizes for longitudinal studies by allowing
  users to enter required pilot estimates. For Alzheimer's studies, the app can estimate
  required pilot parameters using data from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative
  (ADNI). Illustrative examples are used to demonstrate how the package and app can
  be used to generate sample size and power curves. The package and app are designed
  to help researchers easily assess the operating characteristics of study designs
  for Alzheimer's clinical trials and other research studies with longitudinal continuous
  outcomes. Data used in preparation of this article were obtained from the Alzheimer's
  Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database (adni.loni.usc.edu).

# Introduction {#sec1}

Longitudinal designs are generally preferred over cross-sectional
research designs as they provide richer data and greater statistical
power. As such, many biomedical and medical studies employ longitudinal
designs to study changes over time in outcomes at the individual, group,
or population level. Early in the design of a longitudinal experimental
or natural history study, it is imperative to ensure that the study is
adequately powered for its aims. Inadequate sample sizes leads to
invalid or inconclusive inference and squandered resources
[@{Lu_Methrotra_Liu(2009)}; @{Yan_Su(2006)}]. On the other hand,
oversampling squanders resources and exposes participants to unnecessary
risks associated with the intervention [@{Lu_Methrotra_Liu(2009)}].
Thus, optimal sample size and power analysis have become important
prerequisites for any quantitative research design. Not only are these
required during the design phase of research, but it has also become
mandatory for ethical, scientific, or economic justification in
submissions to institutional review boards and research funding
agencies.

Determining the right sample size for a study is not a straightforward
task. Despite the plethora of sample size formulas for repeated measures
[@{Overall_Doyle(1994)}; @{Lui(1992)}; @{Rochon(1991)}; @{Guo_etal(2013)}],
cluster repeated measures [@{Liu_Shih_Gehan(2002)}], multivariate
repeated measures [@{Vonesh_Schork(1986)}; @{Guo_Johnson(1996)}],
longitudinal research designs [@{Lefante(1990)}], the tasks of gathering
pilot estimates of the necessary parameters and getting the right
software to carry out the computation can be challenging. Researchers
commonly rely on formulas for very basic cross-sectional studies and
adjust for attrition and other longitudinal design effects. Although
such approaches can yield appropriate approximations, the ideal approach
is to use a formula derived directly from the longitudinal model that
researchers plan to eventually use on the study data.

[@{Guo_etal(2013)}] describe practical methods for the selection of
appropriate sample size for repeated measures addressing issues of
missing data, and the inclusion of more than one covariate to control
for differences in response at baseline. Sample size formulas are
refined depending on the specific situation and design features. For
example, [@{Hedeker_Gibbons_Waternaux(1999)}] considered a sample size
for longitudinal designs comparing two groups that accounted for
participant attrition or drop-out. [@{Basagana_Liao_Spiegelman(2011)}]
derived sample size formulas for continuous longitudinal data with
time-varying exposure variables typical of observational studies.
Ignoring time-varying exposure was demonstrated to lead to substantial
overestimation of the minimum required sample size which can be
economically disadvantageous. In non-traditional longitudinal designs
such as designs for mediation analysis of the longitudinal study,
further refinements to sample size formulas are needed to ensure that
sufficient sample sizes are obtained [@{Pan_etal(2018)}]. However, these
formulas usually require additional parameters such as exposure mean,
variance, and intraclass correlations
[@{Basagana_Liao_Spiegelman(2011)}], mediation effect, number of
repeated measures [@{Pan_etal(2018)}], covariance structures
[@{Rochon(1991)}], non-linear trends [@{Yan_Su(2006)}], missing,
attrition or dropout rates [@{Roy_etal(2007)}; @{Lu_Luo_Chen(2008)}],
among others. Advanced sample size methods simultaneously handle several
practical issues associated with the research design and complications
that may arise during data collection. However, such methods are only
available in commercial software [@{NCSS(2021)}; @{nQuery(2021)}].

Several R packages can be found on CRAN to compute sample size based on
mixed-effect models and other specific designs depending on the area of
applications. For example, [@{Martin_etal(2011)}] proposed a
simulation-based power calculation and an R package
[pamm](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=pamm) for random regression
models, a specific form of mixed-effect model that detects significant
variation in individual or group slopes. In their approach, a power
analysis was performed to detect a specified level of individual and
environmental interactions within evolution and ecology applications.
This is achieved by simulating power to detect a given covariance
structure. Other simulation-based packages for power analysis are the
[SIMR](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=SIMR) by
[@{Green_MacLeod(2016)}] for linear and generalized linear mixed models
and [clusterPower](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=clusterPower) by
[@{Kleinman(2021)}] for cluster-randomized and cross-over designs.
[@{Schoenfeld(2019)}] developed a power and sample size package called
[LPower](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=LPower)
[@{Diggle_Liang_Zeger(1994)}] to perform power analysis for longitudinal
design accounting for attrition and different random effect
specification. The approach requires the specification of a design
matrix, and the variance-covariance matrix of the repeated measures
[@{Yi_Panzarella(2002)}]. In pharmacokinetic study designs,
[@{Kloprogge_Tarning(2015)}] developed the
[PharmPow](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=PharmPow) power
calculation package for mixed study designs including crossover and
parallel designs. Quite recently, other R packages for performing power
analysis exist for different designs; for example the
[powerMediation](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=powerMediation)
[@{Qiu(2021)}] for mediation effect, mean change for longitudinal study
with 2-time points, the slope for simple Poisson regression, etc.;
[powerEQTL](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=powerEQTL)
[@{Dong_etal(2021)}] for unbalanced one-way ANOVA in a Bulk Tissue and
Single-Cell eQTL Analysis;
[WebPower](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=WebPower)
[@{Zhang_Mai_Yang(2021)}] for basic and advanced power correlation,
proportion, $t$-test, one-way ANOVA, two-way ANOVA, linear regression,
logistic regression, Poisson regression, mediation analysis,
longitudinal data analysis, structural equation modeling, and multilevel
modeling; among others. These packages were tailored towards very
specific areas of application although the methods can be adapted and
utilized for other disciplines. In terms of software applications,
attempts have been made in recent times to implement power and sample
size calculations in Shiny applications to facilitate easy usage. For
example, [@{Hemming_etal(2020)}] developed an R Shiny app to conduct
power analysis for several cluster designs including parallel,
cross-over, and stepped-wedge designs.
[@{Schoemann_Boulton_Short(2017)}] Shiny application conducts power
analysis for mediation model, and [@{Hu_Qu(2021)}] performs sample size
and power calculations for a random coefficient regression model (RCRM)
and a two-stage mixed-effects model.

As the analysis model and associated sample size formula become more
sophisticated, estimating the parameters required by the formula becomes
more challenging. A major hurdle to overcome is the availability of
pilot data to inform these parameters. To assist Alzheimer's researchers
with this challenge, we have developed a power and sample size Shiny app
for Alzheimer's clinical trials. The app implements formulas for the
linear mixed-effects model and mixed model for repeated measures [MMRM;
@{Lu_Luo_Chen(2008)}] allowing the user to input their pilot estimates,
or allow the app to generate pilot estimates using data from the
Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative [ADNI;
@{Weiner_etal(2015)}].

# Review of methods {#sec2}

Continuous outcomes in clinical trial data collected longitudinally over
time are commonly analyzed using linear mixed models [LMM;
@{Laird_Ware(1982)}] or MMRM
[@{Mallinckrodt_etal(2001)}; @{Mallinckrodt_etal(2003)}]. Before such
trials, it is necessary to estimate the required sample size for a given
treatment effect with desired power and Type I error. Various sample
size approaches for longitudinal data have been proposed. We review a
few of the most commonly used methods applied in Alzheimer's disease
trials with continuous outcomes.

## Sample size computation based on the linear mixed-effects model {#model}

Several sample size approaches have been developed by different authors.
[@{Diggle_etal(2002)}] proposed sample size formulas for two approaches
to continuous longitudinal outcomes, one that assumes a constant mean
over time and compares the average response over time between groups,
and another that assumes a linear change over time and compares the mean
rate of change or slope difference between groups. In either case, the
null hypothesis is that there is no difference between groups. Suppose
that $Y_{ij}$ is the response for participant $i$ taken at time $j$. To
compare the average response between two groups (e.g. group $A$
receiving active treatment and group $B$ receiving control) across time,
consider the model $$Y_{ij}=\beta_0+\beta_1T_i+\epsilon_{ij}$$ where
$T_i$ is the treatment indicator which is coded 1 for participants in
group $A$ and 0 for participants in group $B$, and $\epsilon_{ij}$ the
error term for subject, $i$ at time $j$, which is normally distributed
with common variance, $\sigma^2$. The sample size required per group to
detect an average response between the two groups, $\delta$, is given by
$$m=\frac{2(Z_{1-\alpha/2}+Z_{P})^2\sigma^2(1+(J-1)\rho)}{J\delta^2}$$
where $\alpha$ is the type I error rate, $P$ is the level of power, and
$\mbox{corr}(Y_{ij},Y_{ik})=\rho$ for all $j\neq k$.

To test difference in the slopes or average rate of change between the
two groups, consider the parameterization:
$$Y_{ij}=\beta_{0A}+\beta_{1A}t_{ij}+\epsilon_{ij}, i=1,2,\dots,m; j=1,2,\dots,J.$$
A similar parameterization can be specified for group $B$ with
parameters $\beta_{0B}$, and $\beta_{1B}$ representing the intercept and
slope. The parameters $\beta_{1A}$ and $\beta_{1B}$ are the rate of
change of the outcome for groups $A$ and $B$, respectively. Assume that
$\mbox{var}(\epsilon_{ij})=\sigma^2$ and
$\mbox{corr}(Y_{ij},Y_{ik})=\rho$ for all $j\neq k$. If the outcome of
each participant is measured at the same time, $t_j$, then the sample
size per group needed to detect a difference in the rate of change for
each group, $\Delta=\beta_A-\beta_B$, is given by
$$m=\frac{2(Z_{1-\alpha/2}+Z_{P})^2\sigma^2(1-\rho)}{Js^2_t\Delta^2}$$
where $\alpha$ is the type I error rate, $P$ is the power, and
$s^2_t=\frac{\sum (t_j-\bar{t})}{J}$ is the within-participant variance
of $t_j$.

Another sample size computation approach for correlated data is derived
by [@{Liu_Liang(1997)}] to detect differences in the average response
between two groups. This approach derived sample size following the
generalized estimating equation [@{Liang_Zeger(1986)}] approach. Thus,
different outcomes types can be handled. A special case is for a
continuous response measured repeatedly over time and modeled using a
linear model. Consider the model
$$Y_{ij}=\beta_0+\beta_1T_i+\epsilon_{ij}, i=1,2,\dots, N,j=1,2,\dots,J$$
where $T_i$ is the treatment indicator, $\epsilon_{ij}$ is the error
term assumed to follow a multivariate normal distribution with a mean
vector of zeros, $\mbox{\boldmath $0$}$, and covariance matrix,
$\sigma^2 \mbox{\boldmath $R$}$ and $\mbox{\boldmath $R$}$ is a
$J\times J$ working correlation matrix. Different covariance structures
such as independent, exchangeable, auto-regressive, and unstructured can
be assumed. To estimate the total sample size required, $N$ for a given
significance level ($\alpha$) and pre-specified nominal power, $P$, the
following formula is used:
$$N=\frac{\left(Z_{1-\alpha/2}+Z_{P}\right)^2\sigma^2}{\pi_A\pi_B(\beta_1^2 \mbox{\boldmath $1$}  \mbox{\boldmath $R$} ^{-1} \mbox{\boldmath $1$} )}$$
where $\pi_A$ and $\pi_B$ represent the proportion of observations in
the control and treated groups, respectively. By assuming an
exchangeable working correlation matrix, this formula reduces to
$$N=\frac{\left(Z_{1-\alpha/2}+Z_{P}\right)^2\sigma^2[1+(J-1)\rho]}{\pi_A\pi_B\beta_1^2J}.$$
It can be observed that for equal proportion of participants in each
group i.e. $\pi_A=\pi_B=\frac{1}{2}$, the formula for the sample size
per group is equivalent to the sample size formula for difference in
average response between groups by [@{Diggle_etal(2002)}] above. An
appealing aspect of [@{Liu_Liang(1997)}] approach is that it can allow
for unequal allocation to the two groups, and different outcome types
are considered.

Another approach is based on the LMM analysis
[@{Fitzmaurice_Laird_Ware(2004)}] comparing mean rate of change between
groups [@{Ard_Edland(2011)}; @{Zhao_Edland(2020)}]. Consider the LMM
$$Y_{ij}=X'_{ij} \mbox{\boldmath $\beta$} +b_{0i}+b_{1i}t_{ij}+\epsilon_{ij}$$
where $X_{ij}$ denotes a vector of indicator variables (treatment, time,
and interaction terms),
$\mbox{\boldmath $b$} _i=(b_{0i},b_{1i})'\sim N\left(\left(\begin{array}{cc}
0\\0
\end{array}\right),\left[\begin{array}{cc}
\sigma^2_{b_0}&\sigma_{b_{0},b_{1}}\\
\sigma_{b_{0},b_1}&\sigma^2_{b_1}
\end{array}\right]\right)$ are random participant-specific effects, and
$\epsilon_{ij}\sim N(0,\sigma^2_e)$ are the residual errors. The random
terms, $\mbox{\boldmath $b$} _i$ and $\epsilon_{ij}$ are assumed to be
independent of each other. Following this model specification,
[@{Ard_Edland(2011)}] proposed a total sample size formula given by
$$N=\frac{4\left(Z_{1-\alpha/2}+Z_{P}\right)^2}{\Delta^2}\left[\sigma^2_{b_1}+\frac{\sigma^2_e}{\sum (t_j-\bar{t})^2}\right]$$
where $t_j$ indexes the times at which measures are made assuming all
participants are observed at the same time points, $\bar{t}$ is the mean
of the times, $\sigma^2_{b_1}$ is the variance of the
participant-specific random slope, and $\Delta$ is the difference in
mean rate of change in treatment versus control group to be detected.
For a random-intercept mixed-effect model, the total sample size formula
reduces to
$$N=\frac{4\left(Z_{1-\alpha/2}+Z_{P}\right)^2}{\Delta^2}\left[\frac{\sigma^2_e}{\sum (t_j-\bar{t})^2}\right].$$
This sample size formula does not account for the correlation between
the random intercept and slope, a limitation that can be mitigated by a
recent approach by [@{Hu_Mackey_Thomas(2021)}].

## Sample size computation based on the mixed model for repeated measures (MMRM) {#model2}

An alternative approach is to treat time as a categorical variable. This
approach, common in trials of treatments of Alzheimer's and other
therapeutic areas, is often referred to as the MMRM
[@{Mallinckrodt_etal(2001)}; @{Mallinckrodt_etal(2003)}; @{Lane(2008)}].
The approach to fitting the MMRM is similar to that for other linear
mixed-effect models for longitudinal or repeated measures except the
unstructured modelling of time -- treated as a categorical variable, and
the specification of a within-participant correlation structure to
account for association among the repeated measurements. The MMRM
provides an estimate of the mean response for each time point category,
for each group, and the resulting mean trajectory over time is
unconstrained. The primary test statistic is usually the estimated group
difference at the final time point. The null hypothesis is again that
there is no difference between groups.

Suppose that $Y_{ij}$ is the $j$th measurement taken of participant
$i; i=1,2,\dots,N$ at time, $t_{ij}$ and $T_i$ represents treatment or
group indicator. Assuming we have two groups, $a; =(A,B)$, let $n_{a_j}$
be the number of participants at time $j=1,2,\dots,J$ for group $a$.
Thus, at time point 1, the total number of participants is
$n_{A1}+n_{B1}$. The response variable is assumed to follow a
multivariate normal distribution with mean, variance-covariance and
correlation matrix given respectively as $$\begin{aligned}
E(Y_{ij}|T_i=a)&=&\mu_{aj}\\
cov(Y_{ij}, Y_{ik}|T_i=a)&=&\sigma_{ajk}= \mbox{\boldmath $\Sigma$} _a\\
corr(Y_{ij}, Y_{ik}|T_i=a)&=&\frac{\sigma_{jk}}{\sigma_j\sigma_k}= \mbox{\boldmath $R$} \end{aligned}$$
where $\sigma_j=\sigma_{jj}^{\frac{1}{2}}$. It is common to assume that
the variance-covariance matrix is the same for each group in which case
we can have
$\mbox{\boldmath $\Sigma$} _A= \mbox{\boldmath $\Sigma$} _B= \mbox{\boldmath $\Sigma$}$.
Different correlation structures, $\mbox{\boldmath $R$}$, can be assumed
(eg., compound symmetry, autoregressive and unstructured). The sample
size formula for MMRM [@{Lu_Luo_Chen(2008)}] can account for the
attrition rate at each time point. Define the attrition rate
$\zeta_{aj}=1-r_{aj}$, where $r_{aj}=\frac{n_{aj}}{n_{a1}}$ is the
retention rate at time point, $j$. The sample size for group $A$ needed
to achieve a power, $P$, at a significance level, $\alpha$ is given by
$$n_{A1}=(\psi_A+\lambda\psi_B)(Z_{1-\alpha/2}+Z_{P})^2\frac{\sigma^2_J}{\delta_J}$$
where $\lambda=\frac{n_{A1}}{n_{B1}}$ is called the allocation ratio,
$\delta_J$ is the effect size (difference in mean response between the
two groups) at the last time point, $J$, and $\psi_a$ is the $(J, J)$th
component of the variance inflation factor, $I_a^{*-1}$ defined with
respect to an estimation of the $\mu_{aj}$ for treatment group, $a$.
Specifically, $\psi_a=\left[I_a^{*-1}\right]_{JJ}$ where
$$I_a^*=\sum_{j=1}^{J}(r_{a,j}-r_{a,j+1})\begin{bmatrix}
 \mbox{\boldmath $R$} _j^{-1}&0_{j\times (J-j)}\\0_{(J-j)\times j}&0_{(J-j)\times (J-j)}
\end{bmatrix}$$ The total sample size at the first time point is
therefore given by
$$n_{A1}+n_{B1}=(1+\lambda^{-1})(\psi_A+\lambda\psi_B)(Z_{1-\alpha/2}+Z_{P})^2\frac{\sigma^2_J}{\delta_J}.$$

## The [longpower](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=longpower) package {#model3}

The aforementioned sample size approaches have been implemented in an R
package, [longpower](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=longpower)
[@{Donohue_Edland(2020)}], that can be found on CRAN via the URL
<https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/longpower/index.html>. The
package also contains functions which translate pilot mixed effect model
parameters (e.g. random intercept and/or slope) into marginal model
parameters so that the formulas of [@{Diggle_etal(2002)}] or
[@{Liu_Liang(1997)}] or [@{Lu_Luo_Chen(2008)}] formula can be applied to
produce sample size calculations for two sample longitudinal designs
assuming known variance.

## A web-based app {#model4}

The interactive Shiny [@{RShiny(2021)}] application available from the
URL <https://atrihub.shinyapps.io/power/> is an interface to the
longpower package developed to easily generate sample size and conduct
power analysis for a longitudinal study design with two-group
comparisons for a continuous outcome. The app similarly implements the
sample size formula of [@{Liu_Liang(1997)}] and
[@{Diggle_Liang_Zeger(1994)}; @{Diggle_etal(2002)}] using functions in
the longpower package. A novel feature of the app is that it can
generate required pilot estimates by sourcing data from the Alzheimer's
Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI).

# Illustrations {#sec3}

## Illustration of the longpower package

ADNI is a population-based longitudinal cohort study that follows study
participants to collect data on their clinical, cognitive, imaging
including MRI and PET images, genetic, and biochemical biomarkers. The
study was designed to discover, optimize, standardize, and validate
clinical trial measures and biomarkers that are used in AD clinical
research. This multi-site longitudinal study runs at about 63 sites in
the US and Canada and began in 2004. All the data generated from the
ADNI study are entered into a data repository hosted at the Laboratory
of Neuroimaging (LONI) at the University of Southern California, the
LONI Image & Data Archive (IDA). The data can be freely accessed upon
request. Apart from the many uses of the data for advancing knowledge
for AD trials [@{Weiner_etal(2015)}], this big data resource can be used
to improve study design. Specifically, in this paper, the data is used
to generate pilot estimates for the computation of sample size and
power.

We consider an Alzheimer's disease example using ADAS-Cog
[@rosen1984alzheimer] pilot estimates from the ADNI database. Suppose
that we want to compute the sample size required to detect an effect of
1.5 at the 5% level of significance and 80% power. The LMM fit to ADNI
data has an estimated variance of random slope for group A (placebo or
control group) of 74, and a residual variance of 10. Assuming study
visits at (0.00, 0.25, 0.50, 0.75, 1.00, 1.25, 1.50) years, the sample
size using the 'edland' approach can be obtained by using the
edland.linear.power() functions in the longpower R package as follows.

::: example
\> t = seq(0,1.5,0.25) \> edland.linear.power(delta=1.5, t=t, sig2.s =
24, sig2.e = 10, sig.level=0.05, power = 0.80)

Zhao and Edland, in process

N = 414.6202 n = 207.3101, 207.3101 delta = 1.5 t = 0.00, 0.25, 0.50,
0.75, 1.00, 1.25, 1.50 p = 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1 p_2 = 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1
sig2.int = 0 sig.b0b1 = 0 sig2.s = 24 sig2.e = 10 sig2.int_2 = 0
sig.b0b1_2 = 0 sig2.s_2 = 24 sig2.e_2 = 10 sig.level = 0.05 power = 0.8
alternative = two.sided

NOTE: N is \*total\* sample size and n is sample size in \*each\* group
:::

An alternative approach is to use lmmpower() and specify the argument
method=\"edland\" in the following way.

::: example
\> lmmpower(delta=1.5, t=t, sig2.s = 24, sig2.e = 10, sig.level=0.05,
power = 0.80,method=\"edland\")

Zhao and Edland, in process

N = 414.6202 n = 207.3101, 207.3101 delta = 1.5 t = 0.00, 0.25, 0.50,
0.75, 1.00, 1.25, 1.50 p = 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1 p_2 = 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1
sig2.int = 0 sig.b0b1 = 0 sig2.s = 24 sig2.e = 10 sig2.int_2 = 0
sig.b0b1_2 = 0 sig2.s_2 = 24 sig2.e_2 = 10 sig.level = 0.05 power = 0.8
alternative = two.sided

NOTE: N is \*total\* sample size and n is sample size in \*each\* group
:::

The Diggle and Liu & Liang approaches can be applied with the
diggle.linear.power() and\
lui.liang.linear.power() functions, respectively. The lmmpower()
functions can be used for either approach with the appropriate
specification of the 'method' argument.

The second illustrative example is the hypothetical clinical trial
discussed in [@{Diggle_etal(2002)}]. Suppose that we are interested in
testing the effect of a new treatment in reducing blood pressure through
a clinical trial. The investigator is interested in randomizing
participants between a control and active treatment group to have equal
size. Three visits are envisaged with assessments planned at years 0, 2,
and 5. Thus, $n=3$ and $s^2_x=4.22$. Assuming a type I error rate of 5%,
power of 80% and smallest meaningful difference of 0.5 mmHg/year, we
want to determine the number of participants needed for both treated and
control groups for varying correlations (0.2, 0.5 and 0.8) and response
variance (100, 200, 300).

The above code reproduces the table on page 29 of
[@{Diggle_etal(2002)}]. We also reproduce the table on page 30 of
[@{Diggle_etal(2002)}] for detecting a difference in average response
between two groups through the method by [@{Liu_Liang(1997)}] as
follows:

The sample size formula for the MMRM approach is also implemented in the
longpower package's power.mmrm() function. To illustrate how this
approach is implemented, consider a hypothetical example with a
correlation matrix having 0.25 as off-diagonal entries (exchangeable), a
retention vector (1, 0.90,0.80,0.70) and standard deviation of 1, for
group A. Assuming these values to be the same for group B, then the
sample size required to detect an effect size of 0.5 at 5% level of
significance and 80% power is computed as follows:

::: example
\> Ra \<- matrix(0.25, nrow = 4, ncol = 4) \> diag(Ra) \<- 1
#exchangeable correlation matrix for group A \> ra \<- c(1, 0.90, 0.80,
0.70)#retention in group A \> sigmaa \<- 1 #standard deviation for group
A \> power.mmrm(Ra = Ra, ra = ra, sigmaa = sigmaa, delta = 0.5, power =
0.80)

Power for Mixed Model of Repeated Measures (Lu, Luo, & Chen, 2008)

n1 = 86.99175 n2 = 86.99175 retention1 = 1.0, 0.9, 0.8, 0.7 retention2 =

## Illustration of the Shiny app

We demonstrate how the app is used to perform power analysis by
inputting user-specified values and a specific sample size approach. We
make use of the values shown in
Table [1](#parameters){reference-type="ref" reference="parameters"}. For
the MMRM method, we specify the options assuming an exchangeable
correlation structure.

For the ADNI-based pilot estimate generator, we select the full range of
values for some selected variables (See
Figure [1](#ADNIbase){reference-type="ref" reference="ADNIbase"}).

### App menus and contents

The app has three main menus on the sidebar. The first menu has two
sub-menus which let the user perform power and sample size calculations
based on longitudinal designs when necessary pilot estimates are known.
The first submenu, the default, accepts user-specified inputs and
generates a graphical output and summary of the inputs. In the 'input'
box, as shown in Figure [\[LMMinput\]](#LMMinput){reference-type="ref"
reference="LMMinput"}a, users are aided with the selection of their
inputs through widgets such as select input, numerical input, slider
input, and radio button to facilitate the user selection. The select
input for 'Analysis Type' allows the user to select whether the user
desires to determine power or sample size. Input parameters that are not
applicable for a given selection or are not applicable for the selected
sample size method are grayed out to enhance the user experience. For
example, the allocation ratio input widget is grayed out when the
'diggle' and 'liuliang' procedures are selected. The 'output' box, shown
in Figure [\[LMMinput\]](#LMMinput){reference-type="ref"
reference="LMMinput"}b, displays a graph of power versus sample size, a
note on the method for the sample size computation, and a summary of the
selected inputs by the user. The second submenu enables the user to
conduct power analysis based on the MMRM methodology. Widgets such as
select inputs, slider inputs, numerical inputs, and radio buttons
display the current values of the model parameter in the 'input' box
(See Figure [\[MMRMinput\]](#MMRMinput){reference-type="ref"
reference="MMRMinput"}a). As the MMRM requires the specification of an
association structure and a vector of the retention rates, the app
display vectors, and matrix inputs widgets. The size of these widgets
depends on users' choice of the number of time points for the study.
However, these widgets are not reactive, and therefore the user must use
the "Update/Enter\" action button when changes are made to the number of
time points to update the vector and matrix input widgets. The
corresponding graphical and summary outputs are reactively displayed
within the 'output' box, immediately below the 'input' box (See
Figure [\[MMRMinput\]](#MMRMinput){reference-type="ref"
reference="MMRMinput"}b).

The second menu item also has two sub-menus for the LMM and the MMRM
methods, respectively. In this menu, the app enables the user to
generate pilot estimates from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging
Initiative (ADNI) data that is fed into the application to perform the
power calculations.

In the box for 'baseline selection', the user can select variables that
define their study population. By default, all variables are selected,
utilizing all the data in the ADNI. A variable can be deselected from
the left side of the box with a click. After the user selection of the
variable, the user can submit by clicking on the 'submit selected
criteria' action button to activate the corresponding widgets in the
next box. The 'Inclusion/exclusion criteria' box is made of a slider and
select input widgets which allow the user to select a range of values
for the selected population characteristics (See
Figure [1](#ADNIbase){reference-type="ref" reference="ADNIbase"}).
Baseline summaries are produced by the app according to the selections
of the user. Summaries by gender, education, ethnicity, and race are
provided for the selected population. For continuous variables, the
number of observations, number of missing observations, mean, median,
lower and upper quantiles are displayed, while for categorical
variables, the total and level-specific number of observations, and
percentages are displayed. These bivariate summaries give the user a
clear presentation of the data per the selected inclusion and exclusion
criteria.

![Screenshot of Shiny app menu for ADNI-based pilot estimate generator.
The user can select variables and associated ranges for desired
inclusion/exclusion criteria. The app then filters the ADNI data
accordingly, summarizes the characteristics of the filtered data, fits a
linear mixed model (LMM), and extracts pilot estimates required for
power calculations.](Figures/ADNI-inputs.pdf){#ADNIbase width="14cm"}

Next, the user can choose a primary outcome from among some that are
commonly used for Alzheimer's disease studies. Pilot estimates are
obtained from fitting a LMM for the selected outcome for the power
analysis. The estimates of the model can be adjusted with some
user-selected covariate options. Data on the selected outcome from
baseline to the selected number of years of the study are presented by
individual-level and smooth mean profile plots. The app allows the
selection of options for selecting the sample size method, type of test,
type I error rate, percentage change, and allocation ratio as inputs for
the power analysis (see Figure [2](#ADNIOutput2){reference-type="ref"
reference="ADNIOutput2"}). Finally, the graphical output for the power
analysis and summary of the inputs used are displayed in the 'output'
box. The summary of the LMM is also shown (see
Figure [3](#ADNIOutput3){reference-type="ref" reference="ADNIOutput3"}).

![Screenshot of Shiny app input and output for ADNI-based pilot estimate
generator. Once the user has selected variables and associated ranges
for desired inclusion/exclusion criteria
(Figure [1](#ADNIbase){reference-type="ref" reference="ADNIbase"}), the
app summarizes the characteristics of the filtered data, including these
spaghetti and dots plots (middle green box). The user must select the
desired analysis model covariates and outcome (top red boxes); and other
analysis model and study design features (bottom red
box).](Figures/ADNI-mmrm-out2.pdf){#ADNIOutput2 width="14cm"}

![Screenshot of Shiny app output for ADNI-based pilot estimate
generator. The bottom box shows R output summarizing a linear mixed
model fit to a subset of ADNI data with desired inclusion/exclusion
criteria applied. The top box shows study characteristics and a power
curve derived using parameters from the fitted
model.](Figures/ADNI-mmrm-out3.pdf){#ADNIOutput3 width="14cm"}

The interface of the second sub-menu is very similar to the first except
that the sample size methodology is based on the MMRM. Additionally, the
model fitting options include specifying an association structure,
allocation ratio, and percentage retention for the two groups.

The final menu on the sidebar is the 'About' menu, which provides brief
information of the dashboard, data description, and acknowledgment of
the ADNI resources, packages used for developing the dashboard, and
contact information of the developers of the dashboard.

# Discussion {#sec4}

In this manuscript, we have presented the longpower R package, and a
Shiny app dashboard that facilitates sample size and power analysis for
a longitudinal study design with two-group comparisons of a continuous
outcome. The app implements the sample size formulas of
[@{Liu_Liang(1997)}],
[@{Diggle_Liang_Zeger(1994)}; @{Diggle_etal(2002)}],
[@{Lu_Luo_Chen(2008)}], and [@{Ard_Edland(2011)}] using functions in the
longpower package. The package also handles models in which time is
treated either as continuous (e.g. with random intercepts and slopes) or
categorical (MMRM).

The longpower package was created to allow R users easy access to sample
size formulas for longitudinal data that were already available in the
literature. Many of the earlier papers on the topic provided no
software, and so considerable effort was required by each reader to
program implementations of the formulas. Collecting these formulas into
an R package makes the methods more accessible and easy to compare. The
package includes unit tests to ensure the software can adequately
reproduce published results, and alternative approaches for the same
study design are validated against each other.

A novel feature of the app is the ability to source pilot data for
Alzheimer's disease trials to generate required parameter estimates. We
focus on Alzheimer's data as our primary area of interest, but future
work could bring in data from other disease areas. Other future
directions include accommodating other outcome types, and keeping up
with the evolving landscape of model parameterizations.
