title: Power and Sample Size for Longitudinal Models in R -- The longpower Package
  and Shiny App
abstract: Longitudinal studies are ubiquitous in medical and clinical research. Sample
  size computations are critical to ensure that these studies are sufficiently powered
  to provide reliable and valid inferences. There are several methodologies for calculating
  sample sizes for longitudinal studies that depend on many considerations including
  the study design features, outcome type and distribution, and proposed analytical
  methods. We briefly review the literature and describe sample size formulas for
  continuous longitudinal data. We then apply the methods using example studies comparing
  treatment versus control groups in randomized trials assessing treatment effect
  on clinical outcomes. We also introduce a Shiny app that we developed to assist
  researchers with obtaining required sample sizes for longitudinal studies by allowing
  users to enter required pilot estimates. For Alzheimer's studies, the app can estimate
  required pilot parameters using data from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative
  (ADNI). Illustrative examples are used to demonstrate how the package and app can
  be used to generate sample size and power curves. The package and app are designed
  to help researchers easily assess the operating characteristics of study designs
  for Alzheimer's clinical trials and other research studies with longitudinal continuous
  outcomes. Data used in preparation of this article were obtained from the Alzheimer's
  Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database (adni.loni.usc.edu).
