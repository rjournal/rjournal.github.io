title: 'Subgroup Discovery with Evolutionary Fuzzy Systems in R: The SDEFSR Package'
abstract: Subgroup discovery is a data mining task halfway between descriptive and
  predictive data mining. Nowadays it is very relevant for researchers due to the
  fact that the knowledge extracted is simple and interesting. For this task, evolutionary
  fuzzy systems are well suited algorithms because they can find a good trade-off
  between multiple objectives in large search spaces. In fact, this paper presents
  the SDEFSR package, which contains all the evolutionary fuzzy systems for subgroup
  discovery presented throughout the literature. It is a package without dependencies
  on other software, providing functions with recommended default parameters. In addition,
  it brings a graphical user interface to avoid the user having to know all the parameters
  of the algorithms.
