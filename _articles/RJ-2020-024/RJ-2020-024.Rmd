title: 'CoxPhLb: An R Package for Analyzing Length Biased Data under Cox Model'
abstract: Data subject to length-biased sampling are frequently encountered in various
  applications including prevalent cohort studies and are considered as a special
  case of left-truncated data under the stationarity assumption. Many semiparametric
  regression methods have been proposed for length biased data to model the association
  between covariates and the survival outcome of interest. In this paper, we present
  a brief review of the statistical methodologies established for the analysis of
  length-biased data under the Cox model, which is the most commonly adopted semiparametric
  model, and introduce an R package CoxPhLb that implements these methods. Specifically,
  the package includes features such as fitting the Cox model to explore covariate
  effects on survival times and checking the proportional hazards model assumptions
  and the stationarity assumption. We illustrate usage of the package with a simulated
  data example and a real dataset, the Channing House data, which are publicly available.
