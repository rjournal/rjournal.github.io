# Introduction

Clustering algorithms are designed to identify groups in data where the
traditional emphasis has been on numeric data. In consequence, many
existing algorithms are devoted to this kind of data even though a
combination of numeric and categorical data is more common in most
business applications. For an example in the context of credit scoring,
see, e.g. @szepannek:2017. The standard way to tackle mixed-type data
clustering problems in R is to use either (1) Gower distance
[@gower:1971] via the
[*gower*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=gower) package [@gower] or
the `daisy(method = "gower")` in the
[*cluster*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=cluster) package
[@cluster]; or (2) Hierarchical clustering through `hclust()` or the
`agnes()` function in *cluster*. Recent innovations include the package
[*CluMix*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=CluMix) [@CluMix], which
combines both Gower distance and hierarchical clustering with some
functions for visualization. As this approach requires computation of
distances between any two observations, it is not feasible for large
data sets. The package
[*flexclust*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=flexclust) [@flexclust]
offers a flexible framework for k-centroids clustering through the
function `kcca()` which allows for arbitrary distance functions. Among
the currently pre-implemented `kccaFamilies`, there is no distance
measure for mixed-type data. Alternative approaches based on
expectation-maximization are given by the function `flexmixedruns()` in
the [*fpc*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=fpc) package [@fpc] and
the package [*clustMD*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=clustMD)
[@clustMD]. Both require the variables in the data set to be ordered
according to their data type, and that categorical variables to be
preprocessed into integers. The clustMD algorithm [@mcparland:2016] also
allows ordinal variables but is quite computationally intensive. The
[*kamila*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=kamila) package [@kamila]
implements the KAMILA clustering algorithm which uses a kernel density
estimation technique in the continuous domain, a multinomial model in
the categorical domain, and the Modha-Spangler weighting of variables in
which categorical variables have to be transformed into indicator
variables in advance [@modhaspangler:2003].

Recently, more algorithms for clustering mixed-type data have been
proposed in the literature
([@ahmad+dey:2007; @dutta:2012; @foss:2016; @he:2005; @hajkacem:2016; @ji:2012; @ji:2013; @ji:2015; @lim:2012; @liu:2017; @pham:2011]).
Many of these are based on the idea of Huang's k-prototypes algorithm
[@huang:1998]. The rest of this paper describes the R package
[*clustMixType*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=clustMixType)
[@clustMixType], which provides up to the author's knowledge the first
implementation of this algorithm in R. The k-modes algorithm
[@huang:1997a] has been implemented in the package
[*klaR*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=klaR) ([@weihs:2005; @klaR])
for purely categorical data, but not for the mixed-data case. The rest
of the paper is organized as follows: A brief description of the
algorithm is followed by the functions in the *clustMixType* package.
Some extensions to the original algorithm are discussed and as well as a
worked example application.

# k-prototypes clustering {#sec:kprototypes}

The k-prototypes algorithm belongs to the family of partitional cluster
algorithms. Its objective function is given by:
$$E = \sum_{i=1}^n \sum_{j=1}^k u_{ij} d\left(x_i, \mu_j\right),$$
where $x_i, i = 1, \ldots, n$ are the observations in the sample,
$\mu_j, j = 1, \ldots, k$ are the cluster prototype observations, and
$u_{ij}$ are the elements of the binary partition matrix
$U_{n \times k}$ satisfying $\sum_{j=1}^k u_{ij} = 1,\, \forall\, i$.
The distance function is given by:
$$d(x_i, \mu_j) = \sum_{m=1}^q \left(x_i^m - \mu_j^m\right)^2 + \lambda \sum_{m=q+1}^p \delta\left(x_i^m,\mu_j^m\right).$$
where $m$ is an index over all variables in the data set where the first
$q$ variables are numeric and the remaining $p-q$ variables are
categorical. Note that $\delta(a,b) = 0$ for $a=b$ and $\delta(a,b) = 1$
for $a \ne b$, and $d()$ corresponds to weighted sum of Euclidean
distance between two points in the metric space and simple matching
distance for categorical variables (i.e. the count of mismatches). The
trade off between both terms can be controlled by the parameter
$\lambda$ which has to be specified in advance as well as the number of
clusters $k$. For larger values of $\lambda$, the impact of the
categorical variables increases. For $\lambda = 0$, the impact of the
categorical variables vanishes and only numeric variables are taken into
account, just as in traditional k-means clustering.

The algorithm iterates in a manner similar to the k-means algorithm
[@macqueen:1967] where for the numeric variables the mean and the
categorical variables the mode minimizes the total within cluster
distance. The steps of the algorithm are:

1.  Initialization with random cluster prototypes.

2.  For each observation do:

    1.  Assign observations to its closest prototype according to $d()$.

    2.  Update cluster prototypes by cluster-specific means/modes for
        all variables.

3.  As long as any observations have swapped their cluster assignment in
    2 or the maximum number of iterations has not been reached: repeat
    from 2.

# k-prototypes in R {#sec:clustMixType}

An implementation of the k-prototypes algorithm is given by the function

``` r
	kproto(x, k, lambda = NULL, iter.max = 100, nstart = 1, na.rm = TRUE)
```

where

-   `x` is a data frame with both numeric and factor variables. As
    opposed to other existing R packages, the factor variables do not
    need to be preprocessed in advance and the order of the variables
    does not matter.

-   `k` is the number of clusters which has to be pre-specified.
    Alternatively, it can also be a vector of observation indices or a
    data frame of prototypes with the same columns as `x`. If ever at
    the initialization or during the iteration process identical
    prototypes do occur, the number of clusters will be reduced
    accordingly.

-   `lambda` $>0$ is a real valued parameter that controls the trade off
    between Euclidean distance for numeric variables and simple matching
    distance for factor variables for cluster assignment. If no
    $\lambda$ is specified the parameter is set automatically based on
    the data and a heuristic using the function `lambdaest()`.
    Alternatively, a vector of length `ncol(x)` can be passed to
    `lambda` (cf. Section on [4](#sec:extensions)).

-   `iter.max` sets the maximum number of iterations, just as in
    `kmeans()`. The algorithm may stop prior to `iter.max` if no
    observations swap clusters.

-   `nstart` may be set to a value $> 1$ to run k-prototypes multiple
    times. Similar to k-means, the result of k-prototypes depends on its
    initialization. If `nstart` $> 1$, the best solution (i.e. the one
    that minimizes $E$) is returned.

-   Generally, the algorithm can deal with missing data but as a default
    `NA`s are removed by `na.rm = TRUE`.

Two additional arguments, `verbose` and `keep.data`, can control whether
information on missing values should be printed and whether the original
data should be stored in the output object. The `keep.data=TRUE` option
is required for the default call to the `summary()` function, but in
case of large `x`, it can be set to `FALSE` to save memory.

The output is an object of class `"kproto"`. For convenience, the
elements are designed to be compatible with those of class `"kmeans"`:

-   `cluster` is an integer vector of cluster assignments

-   `centers` stores the prototypes in a data frame

-   `size` is a vector of corresponding cluster sizes

-   `withinss` returns the sum over all within cluster distances to the
    prototype for each cluster

-   `tot.withinss` is their sum over all clusters which corresponds to
    the objective function $E$

-   `dists` returns a matrix of all observations' distances to all
    prototypes in order to investigate the crispness of the clustering

-   `lambda` and `iter` store the specified arguments of the function
    call

-   `trace` lists the objective function $E$ as well as the number of
    swapped observations during the iteration process

Unlike `"kmeans"`, the `"kproto"` class is accompanied corresponding
`predict()` and `summary()` methods. The `predict.kproto()` method can
be used to assign clusters to new data. Like many of its cousins, it is
called by

``` r
	predict(object, newdata)
```

The output again consists of two elements: a vector `cluster` of cluster
assignments and a matrix `dists` of all observations' distances to all
prototypes.

The investigation resulting from a cluster analysis typically consists
of identifying the differences between the clusters, or in this specific
case, those of the k prototypes. For practical applications besides the
cluster sizes, it is of further interest to take into account the
homogeneity of the clusters. For numeric variables, this can be done by
calling the R function `summary()`. For categorical variables the
representativity of the prototypes is given their frequency distribution
obtained by `prop.table()`. The `summary.kproto()` method applies these
methods to the variables conditional to the resulting clusters and
returns a comparative results table of the clusters for each variable.

The summary is not restricted to the training data but it can further be
applied to new data by calling `summary(object, data)` where `data` are
new data that will be internally passed to the `predict()` method on the
`object` of class `"kproto"`. If no new data is specified (default:
`data = NULL`), the function requires `object` to contain the original
data (argument `keep.data = TRUE`). In addition, a function

``` r
	clprofiles(object, x, vars = NULL)
```

supports the analysis of the clusters by visualization of cluster
profiles based on an `object` of class `"kproto"` and data `x`. Note
that the latter may also have different variables compared to the
original data, such as for profiling variables that were not used for
clustering. As opposed to `summary.kproto()`, no new prediction is done
but the cluster assignments of the `"kproto"` object given by
`object$cluster` are used. For this reason, the observations in `x` must
be the same as in the original data. Via the `vars` argument, a subset
of variables can be specified either by a vector of indices or variable
names. Note that `clprofiles()` is not restricted to objects of class
`"kproto"` but can also be applied to other cluster objects as long as
they are of a `"kmeans"`-like structure with elements `cluster` and
`size`.

# Extensions to the original algorithm {#sec:extensions}

For unsupervised clustering problems, the user typically has to specify
the impact of the specific variables on the desired cluster solution
which is controlled by the parameter $\lambda$. Generally, small values
$\lambda \sim 0$ emphasize numeric variables and will lead to results
similar to standard k-means whereas larger values of $\lambda$ lead to
an increased influence of categorical variables. In @huang:1997b, the
average standard deviation $\sigma$ of the numeric variables is the
suggested choice for $\lambda$ and in some practical applications in the
paper values of $\frac{1}{3}\sigma \le \lambda \le \frac{2}{3}\sigma$
are used. The function

``` r
	lambdaest(x, num.method = 1, fac.method = 1, outtype = "numeric")
```

provides different data based heuristics for the choice of $\lambda$:
The average variance $\sigma^2$ (`num.method = 1`) or standard deviation
$\sigma$ (`num.method = 2`) over all numeric variables is related to the
average concentration $h_{cat}$ of all categorical variables. We compute
$h_{cat}$ by averaging either $h_m = 1-\sum_c p_{mc}^2$
(`fac.method = 1`) or $h_m = 1-\max_c p_{mc}$ (`fac.method = 2`) over
all variables $m$ where $c$ are the categories of the factor variables.
We set $\lambda = \frac{\sigma^t}{h_{cat}}, t \in\{1,2\}$ as a
user-friendly default choice to prevent over-emphasizing either numeric
or categorical variables. If `kproto()` is called without specifying
`lambda`, the parameter is automatically set using
`num.method = fac.method = 1`. Note that this should be considered a
starting point for further analysis; the explicit choice of $\lambda$
should be done carefully based on the application context.

Originally, $\lambda$ is real-valued, but in order to up- or downweight
the relevance of single variables in a specific application context, the
function `kproto()` is extended to accept vectors as input where each
element corresponds to a variable specific weight, $\lambda_m$. The
formula for distance computation changes to:
$$d(x_i, p_j) = \sum_{m=1}^q \lambda_m \left(x_i^m - \mu_j^m\right)^2 + \sum_{m=q+1}^p \lambda_m \delta\left(x_i^m,\mu_j^m\right).$$
Note that the choice of $\lambda$ only affects the assignment step for
the observations but not the computation of the prototype given a
cluster of observations. By changing the `outtype` argument into a
vector, the function `lambdaest()` returns a vector of $\lambda_m$s. In
order to support a user-specific definition of $\lambda$ based on the
variables' variabilities, `outtype = "variation"` returns a vector of
original values of variability for all variables in terms of the
quantities described above.

An issue of great practical relevance is the ability of an algorithm to
deal with missing values which can be solved by an intuitive extension
of k-prototypes. During the iterations, cluster prototypes can be
updated by ignoring `NA`s: Both means for numeric variables as well as
modes for factors can be computed based on the available data.
Similarly, distances for cluster assignment can be computed for each
observation based on the available variables only. This not only allows
cluster assignment for observations with missing values, but already
takes these observations into account when the clusters are formed. By
using `kproto()`, this can be obtained by setting the argument
`na.rm = FALSE`. Note that in practice, this option should be handled
with care unless the number of missing values is very small. The
representativeness of a prototype might become questionable if its means
and modes do not represent the major part of the cluster's observations.

Finally, a modification of the original algorithm presented in Section
[2](#sec:kprototypes) allows for vector-wise computation of the
iteration steps, reducing computation time. The update of the prototypes
is not done after each new cluster assignment, but once each time the
whole data set has been reassigned. The modified k-prototypes algorithm
consists of the following steps:

1.  Initialization with random cluster prototypes.

2.  Assign all observations to its closest prototype according to $d()$.

3.  Update cluster prototypes.

4.  As long as any observations have swapped their cluster assignment in
    2 or the maximum number of iterations has not been reached: repeat
    from 2.

# Example {#sec:application}

As an example, data `x` with two numeric and two categorical variables
are simulated according to the documentation in `?kproto`: Using
`set.seed(42)`, four clusters $j = 1, \ldots, 4$ are designed such that
two pairs can be separated only by their numeric variables and the other
two pairs only by their categorical variables. The numeric variables are
generated as normally distributed random variables with cluster specific
means $\mu_1 = \mu_2 = -\mu_3 = -\mu_4 = \Phi^{-1}(0.9)$ and the
categorical variables have two levels ($A$ and $B$) each with a cluster
specific probability $p_1(A) = p_3(A) = 1-p_2(A) = 1-p_4(A) = 0.9$.
Table [1](#table:simdat) summarizes the clusters. It can be seen that
both numeric and categorical variables are needed in order to identify
all four clusters.

Given the knowledge that there are four clusters in the data, a
straightforward call for k-prototypes clustering of the data will be:

``` r
kpres <- kproto(x = x, k = 4)
kpres                 # output 1
summary(kpres)        # output 2
library(wesanderson)
par(mfrow=c(2,2))
clprofiles(kpres, x, col = wes_palette("Royal1", 4, type = "continuous"))  # figure 1
```

The resulting output is of the form:

``` r
# Output 1:

Numeric predictors: 2
Categorical predictors: 2
Lambda: 5.52477

Number of Clusters: 4
Cluster sizes: 100 95 101 104

```

The first two as well as the last two cluster prototypes share the same
mode in the factor variables but they can be distinguished by their
location with respect to the numeric variables. For clusters 1 & 4 (as
opposed to 2 & 3), it is vice versa. Note that the order of the
identified clusters is not necessarily the same as in cluster
generation. Calling `summary()` and `clprofiles()` provides further
information on the homogeneity of the clusters. A color palette can be
passed to represent the clusters across the different variables for the
plot; here it is taken from the package
[*wesanderson*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=wesanderson)
[@wesanderson].

![Figure 1: Cluster profiles for variables `x1` and
`x3`.](clprofiles.png){#figure:clprofiles width="100%"
alt="graphic without alt text"}

By construction, taking into account either only numeric (k-means) or
only factor variables (k-modes) will not be able to identify the
underlying cluster structure without further preprocessing of the data
in this example. A performance comparison using the Rand index
[@rand:1971] as computed by the package
[*clusteval*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=clusteval) [@clusteval]
results in rand indices of $0.728$ (k-means) and $0.733$ (k-modes). As
already seen above, the prototypes as identified by *clustMixType* do
represent the true clusters quite well, as the corresponding Rand index
improves to $0.870$.

``` r
library(klaR)
library(clusteval)

kmres  <- kmeans(x[,3:4], 4) # kmeans using numerics only
kmores <- kmodes(x[,1:2], 4) # kmodes using factors only

cluster_similarity(kpres$cluster, clusid, similarity = "rand")
cluster_similarity(kmres$cluster, clusid, similarity = "rand")
cluster_similarity(kmores$cluster, clusid, similarity = "rand")
```

The runtime of `kproto()` is linear in the number of observations
[@huang:1997b] and thus it is also applicable to large data sets.
Figure [2](#figure:screeplot) (left) shows the behaviour of the runtime
for 50 repeated simulations of the example data with an increased number
of variables (half of them numeric and half of them categorical). It is
possible to run `kproto()` for more than hundred variables which is far
beyond most practical applications where human interpretation of the
resulting clusters is desired. Note that *clustMixType* is written in R
and currently no C++ code is used to speed up computations which could
be a subject of future work.

In order to determine the appropriate number of clusters for a data set,
we can use the standard scree test. In this case, the objective function
$E$ is given by the output's `tot.withinss` element. The `kproto()`
function is run multiple times for varying numbers of clusters (but
fixed $\lambda$) and the number of clusters is chosen as the minimum $k$
from whereon no strong improvements of $E$ are possible. In
Figure [2](#figure:screeplot) (right), an elbow is visible at the
correct number of clusters in the sample data; recall that we simulatd
from four clusters. Note that from a practitioner's point of view, an
appropriate solution requires clusters that are well represented by
their prototypes. For this reason, the choice of the number of clusters
should further take into account a homogeneity analysis of the clusters
as returned by `summary()`, `clprofiles()` or the `withinss` element of
the `"kproto"` output.

``` r
Es <- numeric(10)
for(i in 1:10){
	kpres <- kproto(x, k = i, nstart = 5)
	Es[i] <- kpres$tot.withinss
}
plot(1:10, Es, type = "b", ylab = "Objective Function", xlab = "# Clusters",
     main = "Scree Plot")  # figure 2
```

# Summary {#sec:summary}

The *clustMixType* package provides a user-friendly way for clustering
mixed-type data in R given by the k-prototypes algorithm. As opposed to
other packages, no preprocessing of the data is necessary, and in
contrast to standard hierarchical approaches, it is not restricted to
moderate data sizes. Its application requires the specification of two
hyperparameters: the number of clusters $k$ as well as a second
parameter $\lambda$ that controls the interplay of the different data
types for distance computation. As an extension to the original
algorithm, the presented implementation allows for a variable-specific
choice of $\lambda$ and can deal with missing data. Furthermore, with
regard to business purposes, functions for profiling a cluster solution
are presented.

This paper is based on *clustMixType* version 0.1-36. Future work may
focus on the development of further guidance regarding the choice of the
parameter $\lambda$, such as using stability considerations [cf.
@hennig:2007], or the investigation of possible improvements in
computation time by integrating *Rcpp* ([@Rcpp; @edelbuettel:2011]).
