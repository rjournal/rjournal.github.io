title: 'clustMixType: User-Friendly Clustering of Mixed-Type Data in R'
abstract: Clustering algorithms are designed to identify groups in data where the
  traditional emphasis has been on numeric data. In consequence, many existing algorithms
  are devoted to this kind of data even though a combination of numeric and categorical
  data is more common in most business applications. Recently, new algorithms for
  clustering mixed-type data have been proposed based on Huangâ€™s k-prototypes algorithm.
  This paper describes the R package clustMixType which provides an implementation
  of k-prototypes in R.
