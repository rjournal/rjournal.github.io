title: 'The politeness Package: Detecting Politeness in Natural Language'
abstract: This package provides tools to extract politeness markers in English natural
  language. It also allows researchers to easily visualize and quantify politeness
  between groups of documents. This package combines and extends prior research on
  the linguistic markers of politeness (Brown and Levinson, 1987; Danescu-Niculescu-Mizil
  et al., 2013; Voigt et al., 2017). We demonstrate two applications for detecting
  politeness in natural language during consequential social interactionsâ€” distributive
  negotiations, and speed dating.
