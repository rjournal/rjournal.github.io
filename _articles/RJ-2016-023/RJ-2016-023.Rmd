title: 'progenyClust: an R package for Progeny Clustering'
abstract: 'Identifying the optimal number of clusters is a common problem faced by
  data scientists in various research fields and industry applications. Though many
  clustering evaluation techniques have been developed to solve this problem, the
  recently developed algorithm Progeny Clustering is a much faster alternative and
  one that is relevant to biomedical applications. In this paper, we introduce an
  R package progenyClust that implements and extends the original Progeny Clustering
  algorithm for evaluating clustering stability and identifying the optimal cluster
  number. We illustrate its applicability using two examples: a simulated test dataset
  for proof-of-concept, and a cell imaging dataset for demonstrating its application
  potential in biomedical research. The progenyClust package is versatile in that
  it offers great flexibility for picking methods and tuning parameters. In addition,
  the default parameter setting as well as the plot and summary methods offered in
  the package make the application of Progeny Clustering straightforward and coherent.'
