title: Measurement Errors in R
abstract: This paper presents an R package to handle and represent measurements with
  errors in a very simple way. We briefly introduce the main concepts of metrology
  and propagation of uncertainty, and discuss related R packages. Building upon this,
  we introduce the errors package, which provides a class for associating uncertainty
  metadata, automated propagation and reporting. Working with errors enables transparent,
  lightweight, less error-prone handling and convenient representation of measurements
  with errors. Finally, we discuss the advantages, limitations and future work of
  computing with errors.
