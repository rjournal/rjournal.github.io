title: 'A Graphical EDA Tool with ggplot2: brinton'
abstract: ' We present [brinton](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=brinton) package,
  which we developed for graphical exploratory data analysis in R. Based on [ggplot2](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=ggplot2),
  [gridExtra](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=gridExtra) and [rmarkdown](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=rmarkdown),
  brinton package introduces wideplot() graphics for exploring the structure of a
  dataset through a grid of variables and graphic types. It also introduces longplot()
  graphics, which present the entire catalog of available graphics for representing
  a particular variable using a grid of graphic types and variations on these types.
  Finally, it introduces the plotup() function, which complements the previous two
  functions in that it presents a particular graphic for a specific variable of a
  dataset. This set of functions is useful for understanding the structure of a data
  set, discovering unexpected properties in the data, evaluating different graphic
  representations of these properties, and selecting a particular graphic for display
  on the screen. '
