title: 'PanJen: An R package for Ranking Transformations in a Linear Regression'
abstract: PanJen is an R-package for ranking transformations in linear regressions.
  It provides users with the ability to explore the relationship between a dependent
  variable and its independent variables. The package offers an easy and data-driven
  way to choose a functional form in multiple linear regression models by comparing
  a range of parametric transformations. The parametric functional forms are benchmarked
  against each other and a non-parametric transformation. The package allows users
  to generate plots that show the relation between a covariate and the dependent variable.
  Furthermore, PanJen will enable users to specify specific functional transformations,
  driven by a priori and theory-based hypotheses. The package supplies both model
  fits and plots that allow users to make informed choices on the functional forms
  in their regression. We show that the ranking in PanJen outperforms the Box-Tidwell
  transformation, especially in the presence of inefficiency, heteroscedasticity or
  endogeneity.
