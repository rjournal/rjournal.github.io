title: Spatio-Temporal Interpolation using gstat
abstract: We present new spatio-temporal geostatistical modelling and interpolation
  capabilities of the R package gstat. Various spatio-temporal covariance models have
  been implemented, such as the separable, product-sum, metric and sum-metric models.
  In a real-world application we compare spatio temporal interpolations using these
  models with a purely spatial kriging approach. The target variable of the application
  is the daily mean PM10 concentration measured at rural air quality monitoring stations
  across Germany in 2005. R code for variogram fitting and interpolation is presented
  in this paper to illustrate the workflow of spatio-temporal interpolation using
  gstat. We conclude that the system works properly and that the extension of gstat
  facilitates and eases spatio-temporal geostatistical modelling and prediction for
  R users.
