title: Spatio-Temporal Interpolation using gstat
abstract: We present new spatio-temporal geostatistical modelling and interpolation
  capabilities of the R package *gstat*. Various spatio-temporal covariance models
  have been implemented, such as the separable, product-sum, metric and sum-metric
  models. In a real-world application we compare spatio-temporal interpolations using
  these models with a purely spatial kriging approach. The target variable of the
  application is the daily mean $\rm{PM}_{10}$ concentration measured at rural air
  quality monitoring stations across Germany in 2005. R code for variogram fitting
  and interpolation is presented in this paper to illustrate the workflow of spatio-temporal
  interpolation using *gstat*. We conclude that the system works properly and that
  the extension of *gstat* facilitates and eases spatio-temporal geostatistical modelling
  and prediction for R users.

# Introduction {#sec:intro0}

The collection and processing of spatio-temporal data is rapidly
increasing due to technological advances and the societal need for
analysis of variables that vary in space and time, such as weather and
air quality variables, and crop yields. Analysis of spatial and temporal
correlations is useful in itself to get insight into the character and
causes of variability, but they are also important to predict values at
points from neighbouring observations. Spatio-temporal interpolation can
potentially provide more accurate predictions than spatial interpolation
because observations taken at other times can be included. In addition,
spatio-temporal interpolation allows predictions to be made at single
locations or entire fields in between and beyond observation times.
However, adding the temporal domain implies that variability in space
and time must be modelled, which is more complicated than modelling
purely spatial or purely temporal variability. The spatial, temporal and
spatio-temporal dependence structures, for instance represented as
variograms, do not necessarily coincide with each other in terms of
their parameters nor in terms of their family. In the simplest case, a
spatio-temporal anisotropy parameter might be enough to deal with the
different dependence structures, but this poses strong assumptions on
the process.

Interpolation of spatial random fields is a common task in
geostatistics. Simple approaches like inverse distance weighted
predictions or the well known kriging procedures have routinely been
applied for many years. Nowadays, modern sensors allow to monitor
different variables at an increasing temporal resolution producing rich
spatio-temporal data sets. This calls as well for theory and methods to
deal with these data sets to gain a better understanding of the observed
spatio-temporal processes. While the theoretical aspects of
spatio-temporal geostatistics show good progress [@Cressie2011],
implementations lack behind. This hinders a wide application of
spatio-temporal modelling, as typically extensive scripting and thorough
understanding is necessary to build spatio-temporal models. Handling of
spatio-temporal data in R is provided by the
[*spacetime*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=spacetime) package
[@Pebesma2012]. In this paper, we present an extension of the
[*gstat*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=gstat) package
[@Pebesma2004] (version 1.1-3) that reuses the *spacetime* classes for
the estimation of spatio-temporal covariance/variogram models and to
perform spatio-temporal interpolation. Our implementation handles
various types of spatio-temporal covariance structures and facilitates
spatio-temporal interpolation. The notation of functions in *gstat* is
extended in a way closely following the purely spatial design. This
allows a researcher acquainted with *gstat* to readily use
spatio-temporal tools. The use of the newly implemented functions is
presented and illustrated by mapping spatio-temporal air-quality data.
Another package that offers extensive spatio-temporal geostatistical
functionality is
[*RandomFields*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=RandomFields)
[@Schlather2014]; further packages are mentioned in the CRAN Task View
on Handling and Analyzing Spatio-Temporal Data[^1].

The paper is organised as follows. The next section introduces the
general interpolation routine and describes the different
spatio-temporal covariance models, followed by a section introducing the
German rural background data set for 2005 and performing the parameter
estimation (i.e. covariance model fitting). Cross-validation results are
presented and discussed in the section thereafter. Conclusions are drawn
in the closing section. R scripts reproducing this study are available
from within the *gstat* package as demos. `stkrige` re-estimates the
variogram models, `stkrige-prediction` re-executes the prediction for a
time series and a couple of stations, and `stkrige-crossvalidation`
re-runs the entire leave-one-out cross-validation (note that the latter
takes a few hours).

# Spatio-temporal dependence modelling and kriging {#sec:theory}

In the following, we will assume a Gaussian spatio-temporal random field
$Z$ defined over a spatial domain $\mathcal{S}$ and temporal domain
$\mathcal{T}$. Typically, a sample
$\mathbf{z} = \left(z(s_1,t_1),\dots,z(s_n,t_n)\right)$ has been
observed at a set of distinct spatio-temporal locations
$(s_1, t_1), \dots, (s_n,t_n) \in \mathcal{S}\times \mathcal{T} \subseteq \mathbb{R}^2 \times \mathbb{R}$
that may include repeated measurements at the same location or
simultaneous measurements at multiple spatial locations. Often, one is
interested in modelling $Z$ from the sample $\mathbf{z}$ in order to
predict at unobserved locations in space and time or simulate from the
conditional distribution.

Across our domain of interest $\mathcal{S} \times \mathcal{T}$, we
assume the random field $Z$ to be stationary and spatially isotropic.
Hence, the field can be characterised through a mean $\mu$ and a
covariance function $C_{\rm st}$ where the spatio-temporal covariance
only depends on the separating distances across space $h
\in \mathbb{R}_{\geq 0}$ and time $u \in \mathbb{R}_{\geq 0}$. Note that
extensions beyond this set-up can easily be derived as has been done for
the pure spatial case using for instance universal kriging to overcome
the stationarity of the mean. The general spatio-temporal covariance
function is given by $C_{\rm st}(h,u) = {\rm
  Cov}\left(Z(s,t), Z(\tilde{s},\tilde{t})\right)$ for a separating
spatial distance $h$ and temporal distance $u$ and any pair of points
$(s,t), (\tilde{s},\tilde{t}) \in \mathcal{S}\times\mathcal{T}$ with
$\|s-\tilde{s}\|=h$ and $|t-\tilde{t}|=u$. In general, this covariance
function is hard to estimate but a couple of models using simplifying
assumptions will be presented in the following together with their
spatio-temporal variograms $\gamma_{\rm st}(h,u) = C_{\rm
  st}(0,0)-C_{\rm st}(h,u)$ and encoding in *gstat*. Given a valid
covariance function, the covariance matrices used in the linear
predictor are easily obtained and the same algebraic operations as in
the well known spatial case yield predictions of the desired random
field [@Cressie2011]. A major difference is, however, the computational
complexity of the matrix inversion. Typically, observations are made at
a rather high temporal frequency leading to a number of spatio-temporal
locations that is too large for global kriging. Hence, interpolation
based on a selected neighbourhood of a subset of all data points becomes
beneficial. Additionally, this relaxes the assumption of stationarity,
as smooth variations in the mean value across the domain can be
respected. The related class of dynamic models also addresses the
computational complexity resulting in a temporal Markov structure.

## Covariance models

The covariance models implemented in *gstat* and presented in this paper
are introduced in the following. Besides further extensions we focus on
the basic classes of the *separable*, *product-sum*, *metric* and
*sum-metric* spatio-temporal covariance functions. The building blocks
(in the following denoted as `spatialVgm`, `temporalVgm` or `jointVgm`)
of the spatio-temporal covariance functions are any of the purely
spatial variogram models already available in *gstat*. Each one of the
building blocks is created by a call of the function `gstat::vgm()`.
Remaining arguments such as `sill` (the joint sill), `nug` (the joint
nugget component) or `stAni` (the spatio-temporal anisotropy used in
`jointVgm`) are scalars and refer to parameters of the entire
spatio-temporal covariance function:

a)  The separable covariance model assumes that the spatio-temporal
    covariance function can be represented as the product of a spatial
    and temporal term:
    $$C_{\rm sep}(h,u)=C_{\rm s}(h)C_t(u)$$
    Its variogram is given by (see Appendix for details):
    $$\gamma_{\rm sep}(h,u) = {\rm sill} \cdot \left( \bar{\gamma}_s(h)+\bar{\gamma}_t(u)-\bar{\gamma}_s(h)\bar{\gamma}_t(u) \right)$$
    where $\bar{\gamma}_s$ and $\bar{\gamma}_t$ are standardised spatial
    and temporal variograms with separate nugget effects and (joint)
    sill of 1. The overall sill parameter is denoted by "sill".

    The R package *gstat* encodes this model as:

    ``` r
    vgmST("separable", space = spatialVgm, time = temporalVgm, sill = sill)
    ```

    The separable model has a strong computational advantage in the
    setting where each spatial location has an observation at each
    temporal instance (a "STFDF" object without `NA`s, @Pebesma2012). In
    these cases, the covariance matrix (and its inverse) can be composed
    using the Kronecker-product of the purely spatial and purely
    temporal covariance matrices (respectively their inverse).

b)  The above model extends to the product-sum covariance model that we
    give here in a slightly different notation as @DeCesare2001 and
    @DeIaco2001 by
    $$C_{\rm ps}(h,u)=k C_{\rm s}(h)C_{\rm t}(u) + C_{\rm s}(h) + C_{\rm t}(u)$$
    with $k > 0$.

    The corresponding variogram can be written as
    $$\gamma_{\rm ps}(h,u) = \left(k \cdot {\rm sill}_{\rm t} + 1\right) \gamma_{\rm s}(h) + \left(k \cdot {\rm sill}_{\rm s} + 1\right) \gamma_{\rm t}(u) - k \gamma_{\rm s}(h) \gamma_{\rm t}(u)$$
    where ${\gamma}_{\rm s}$ and $\gamma_{\rm t}$ are spatial and
    temporal variograms (see Appendix for details). The parameter $k$
    needs to be positive and the following identity defines the overall
    sill (${\rm sill}_{\rm st}$) of the model in terms of the model's
    spatial and temporal sills:
    $${\rm sill}_{\rm st} = k \cdot {\rm sill}_{\rm s} \cdot {\rm sill}_{\rm t} + {\rm sill}_{\rm s} + {\rm sill}_{\rm t}$$
    The above equation can also be used to estimate $k$ based on the
    three sill values. An alternative formulation of the product-sum
    variogram can be found in @DeIaco2001.

    The *gstat* definition of this model reads:

    ``` r
    vgmST("productSum", space = spatialVgm, time = temporalVgm, k = k)
    ```

c)  Assuming identical spatial and temporal covariance functions except
    for spatio-temporal anisotropy, allows to use a spatio-temporal
    metric covariance model where, after matching space and time by an
    anisotropy correction $\kappa$ (`stAni`), the spatial, temporal and
    spatio-temporal distances are treated equally resulting in a single
    covariance model $C_{\rm joint}$:
    $$C_{\rm m}(h,u)=C_{\rm joint}\left(\sqrt{h^2+(\kappa\cdot u)^2}\right)$$
    The variogram evaluates to
    $$\gamma_{\rm m} (h,u) = \gamma_{\rm joint}\left(\sqrt{h^2+(\kappa\cdot u)^2}\right)$$
    where $\gamma_{\rm joint}$ (`jointVgm`) is any known variogram that
    may include a nugget effect. The following line generates the model
    in *gstat*:

    ``` r
    vgmST("metric", joint = jointVgm, stAni = stAni)
    ```

    The spatio-temporal anisotropy parameter $\kappa$ (`stAni`) is given
    as spatial unit per temporal unit. In many cases, this will be in
    m/second, as these are the base units in our implementation. All
    temporal distances are hence internally re-scaled to an equivalent
    spatial distance using `stAni` and treated as metric 3D-space.

d)  A combination of spatial, temporal and a metric model including an
    anisotropy parameter $\kappa$ is found in @Bilonick1988 and
    revisited by @Snepvangers2003 as the sum-metric covariance model:
    $$C_{\rm sm}(h,u)=C_{\rm s}(h)+C_{\rm t}(u)+C_{\rm joint}\left(\sqrt{h^2+(\kappa\cdot u)^2}\right)$$
    This model allows for spatial, temporal and joint nugget effects.
    Thus, the variogram is given by
    $$\gamma_{\rm sm}(h,u)= \gamma_{\rm  s}(h) + \gamma_{\rm t}(u) + \gamma_{\rm joint}\left(\sqrt{h^2+(\kappa\cdot u)^2}\right)$$
    where $\gamma_{\rm s}$, $\gamma_{\rm t}$ and $\gamma_{\rm joint}$
    are spatial, temporal and joint variograms with separate
    nugget-effects. This model can be defined in *gstat* through:

    ``` r
    vgmST("sumMetric", space = spatialVgm, time = temporalVgm, joint = jointVgm,
          stAni = stAni)
    ```

e)  A simplified version of the above model is to restrict the spatial,
    temporal and joint variograms to nugget free models. Additionally, a
    single spatio-temporal nugget is introduced and the variogram takes
    the representation:
    $$\gamma_{\rm ssm}(h,u) = {\rm nug}\cdot {\bf1}_{h>0 \vee u>0} + \gamma_{\rm s}(h) + \gamma_{\rm t}(u) + \gamma_{\rm joint}\left(\sqrt{h^2+(\kappa\cdot u)^2}\right)$$
    The simple sum-metric covariance model can be obtained by:

    ``` r
    vgmST("simpleSumMetric", space = spatialVgm, time = temporalVgm,
          joint = jointVgm, nugget = nug, stAni = stAni)
    ```

Note that the above mentioned spatial, temporal and joint components of
the spatio-temporal covariance and variogram models need not necessarily
exhibit the same structure. Taking for instance the product-sum and
sum-metric models that both contain single temporal and spatial
variogram models: the best fits of the respective spatio-temporal models
might suggest different variogram families and parameters for the pure
spatial and temporal ones. This is due to the target of finding the best
overall variogram surface resulting in (potentially) different marginal
models.

## Parameter estimation

Fitting routines for the above variogram models are implemented in
*gstat* through the function `fit.StVariogram()`, which calls `optim()`
from the R core package *stats*. Additional parameters to improve the
numerical optimisation can be provided to `fit.StVariogram()` and will
be passed on to `optim()` (using R's three-dots mechanism). As some of
the parameters are limited to certain ranges (nuggets need to be
non-negative, ranges must be positive), it is advised to use an
optimisation routine that allows to impose limits on the search space
(i.e. `"L-BFGS-B"`) and provide sensible limits via `lower` and `upper`.
By default, the method `"L-BFGS-B"` is called and the smallest lower and
largest upper bounds supported by the model are given. The estimation of
the spatio-temporal variogram models relies on a sample variogram
empirically derived from the data. In contrast to the spatial variogram
line, the spatio-temporal variogram is represented by a surface for
lag-classes composed of a spatial and temporal separation distance.
Different from the spatial case, a spatio-temporal sample variogram
contains lag-classes of zero spatial separation describing pure temporal
dependencies. Without duplicate observations, no estimates can be made
for the lag-class with both zero spatial and zero temporal separation.
The sample variogram is calculated through the function `variogram()`
that dispatches the call for spatio-temporal data objects (of class
"STFDF", "STSDF", or "STIDF") from *spacetime*. For a visual judgement
of the fit between sample and fitted variograms the `plot()` function
can be called to show the variogram surfaces next to each other as
coloured level plots. Alternatively, a wireframe plot is obtained by
setting the parameter `wireframe = TRUE`
(Figure [3](#fig:allVgmsWireframe)). A further option is to plot the
differences between the sample and model variogram surfaces by setting
`diff = TRUE`, see Figure [4](#fig:allVgmsDiffWireframe). Additionally
to visual comparison, `fit.StVariogram()` provides the output of `optim`
as attribute `optim.out` of the returned S3 class "StVariogram". This
attribute includes valuable information to diagnose the success of the
`optim` routine. It contains for instance the convergence code
(`$convergence`) or message (`$message`) and the optimised value
(`$value`), which is the mean of the (weighted) squared deviations
between sample and fitted variogram surfaces. Furthermore, it is advised
to check the estimated parameters against the parameter boundaries and
starting values. Additionally, starting values might also influence the
success and result of the optimisation, as local optima may occur due to
the interdependence of the parameters. Alternatively, the user might
want to start a grid search in order to better asses the sensitivity of
the estimates.

The fitting approach is identical for all covariance models. However,
with the flexibility of the model also the number of parameters
increases, making a numerical estimation at times cumbersome. Starting
values can in most cases be read from the sample variogram. Parameters
of the spatial and temporal variograms can be assessed from the
spatio-temporal surface fixing the counterpart at 0. The overall
spatio-temporal sill including the nugget can be deducted from the
plateau that a nicely behaving sample variogram reaches for "large"
spatial and temporal distances. An important issue is the potentially
different orders of magnitude of the parameters. It is at times
advisable to rescale spatial and temporal distances to ranges similar to
the ones of sills and nuggets using the parameter `parscale`. `parscale`
needs to be provided via `control = list(parscale = …)` and holds a
vector of the same length as the number of parameters to be optimised
(see the documentation of `optim` for further details).

  notation is used: $N_j$ number of pairs, $h_j$ mean spatial distance
  and $u_j$ mean temporal distance for each bin $j$, $\gamma$ the actual
  proposed variogram model and `stAni` a spatio-temporal anisotropy
  scaling.
:::

Currently, the implemented fitting routines are based on the (weighted)
mean squared difference between model and sample variogram surfaces. By
default, all values are associated the same weight (`fit.method = 6`),
but other options are available that allow for different weighting
schemes based on the number of pairs, spatial, temporal and
spatio-temporal distances or the variogram's value.
Table [1](#tab:weighting) lists all currently implemented options.
Depending on the target neighbourhood size of the desired interpolation,
it might be beneficial to narrow down the spatial and temporal distances
and to introduce a cutoff. This ensures that the model is fitted to the
differences over space and time actually used in the interpolation, and
reduces the risk of overfitting the variogram model to large distances
not used for prediction. Please note that methods 2 and 10
(Table [1](#tab:weighting)) involve weights based on the fitted
variogram that might lead to bad convergence properties of the parameter
estimates. Furthermore, the scalar `stAni` in methods 7 and 11 will
either be the actual fitted spatio-temporal anisotropy if it is included
in the model or a fixed value that has to be passed as `stAni` by the
user to `fit.StVariogram`. The latter is advised, as the former might
lead to bad convergence properties as in the case of weights based on
the fitted variogram mentioned above. As the estimation of an anisotropy
scaling might be cumbersome on a visual basis, we provide the function
`estiStAni` that provides estimates based on the empirical
spatio-temporal variogram. Four heuristics are available based on (i)
rescaling a linear model (`linear`), (ii) estimating equal ranges
(`range`), (iii) rescaling a pure spatial variogram (`vgm`) or (iv)
estimating a complete spatio-temporal metric variogram model and
returning its spatio-temporal anisotropy parameter (`metric`). The
choice of the weighting scheme will influence the selected model and
different weightings might be further assessed in a cross-validation of
the selected model. To increase numerical stability, it is advisable to
use weights that do not change with the current model fit.

## Kriging

Standard kriging (`krigeST`) and trans Gaussian kriging (`krigeSTTg`)
have been implemented. As spatio-temporal kriging based on the complete
data set might be too computationally expensive, local kriging is an
attractive alternative. This poses the question of how to select the
"nearest" neighbours from the spatio-temporal space
$\mathcal{S}\times\mathcal{T}$. A natural choice would be to select the
spatio-temporal locations exhibiting the strongest correlation to the
unobserved location. Depending on the spatio-temporal covariance model,
the relation between spatial and temporal distance in determining the
strength of correlation will vary. As a proxy, we use a spatio-temporal
anisotropy parameter that relates spatial and temporal distances in the
same manner as in the metric covariance models. The $k$-nearest
neighbours within this metric spatio-temporal space
$\mathcal{S}\times\mathcal{T}$ are selected using the R package
[*FNN*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=FNN) [@Beygelzimer2013]. The
interpolation performs iteratively for each spatio-temporal prediction
location with a local subset of the data set. Without neighbourhood
selection, kriging uses all data.

As the metric induced by the spatial and rescaled temporal distances are
only proxies to the strength of correlation between locations (see
Figure [1](#fig:vgmVsDist)), we provide an option to search a larger
metric neighbourhood. Within this larger neighbourhood, the covariance
function is evaluated for all spatio-temporal locations and the
neighbouring locations with the largest covariance values are then
selected for prediction. However, this approach might still suffer from
a clustering of locations and alternatives such as a staged search (find
spatial neighbours first and select a set of temporal instances for each
spatial neighbour) or an octant search (select neighbours per spatial
quadrant from preceding and following time stamps separately) could be
considered. However, these alternatives are not yet available in
*gstat*.

variogram model (as estimated in the application below) and a metric
distance relate to each other. Distances are rescaled by 1/5 for easy
plotting.](figures/vgmVsMetricDist.png){#fig:vgmVsDist width="100%"
style="text-align: center" alt="graphic without alt text"}

# Application and illustration {#sec:data}

The data set used is taken from AirBase[^2], the air quality data base
for Europe provided by the European Environmental Agency (EEA). We focus
on a single air quality indicator, particulate matter with a diameter
less than 10 $\mu\rm m$, measured at rural background stations for 2005
(${\rm PM}_{10}$). The data base contains data for many years. Besides
rural, also urban areas are monitored and not only at background
locations (e.g. traffic stations). However, these processes are
considered to be of a different nature and should be treated separately.
As a use case, we therefore limit our data set to the rural background
stations in Germany. Figure [2](#fig:dailyMeans) shows for 8 randomly
chosen days daily mean values of ${\rm PM}_{10}$ concentrations for the
entire monitoring network over Germany in 2005 with 69 rural background
stations.

![Figure 2: Daily mean $\rm{PM}_{10}$ concentration $[\mu\rm{g/m}^3]$ at
8 randomly selected days in
2005.](figures/daily_means_PM10.png){#fig:dailyMeans width="100%"
style="text-align: center" alt="graphic without alt text"}

In order to fit a spatio-temporal model to the air quality data set, the
empirical variogram surface is computed and used as input for the
fitting routines of the different models. The empirical variogram is
based on spatio-temporal bins that span regularly over space and time.

Regular measurements over time (i.e. hourly, daily) motivate regular
binning intervals of the same temporal resolution. Nevertheless,
flexible binning boundaries can be passed for spatial and temporal
dimensions. This allows for instance to use smaller bins at small
distances and larger ones for large distances. Temporal boundaries,
instead of lags, are required when the sampling of the data is
non-regular. In cases where regular temporal observations can be
assumed, this is utilised in the sample variogram calculations and any
two temporal consecutive observations are assumed to have the same
temporal distance. Figure [3](#fig:allVgmsWireframe) shows the empirical
variogram along with the proposed best fitting model of each
spatio-temporal variogram family as perspective wireframe plots. In
order to better identify structural shortcomings of the selected model,
a difference plot (Figure [4](#fig:allVgmsDiffWireframe)) is a helpful
visual diagnostic plot.

Beyond the selection of the spatio-temporal variogram family, each
component of this model can be chosen from any implemented
one-dimensional variogram. In Table [2](#tab:vgmFits) a selection of
fitted models in terms of their residuals compared to the sample
variogram surface is shown. The best fitting spatio-temporal model of
each family is given as:

The variogram parameters are numerically optimised using the function
`fit.StVariogram` and the `"L-BFGS-B"` routine of `optim`. The parameter
`fit.method` that controls the weighing of the residuals between
empirical and model surface of `fit.StVariogram` is set to `7` (the
spatio-temporal analog to the commonly used spatial weighting). A full
list of all weighting schemes is presented in Table [1](#tab:weighting).
In our application, the residuals are multiplied by the number of pairs
in the corresponding spatio-temporal bin divided by the metric distance:
$N_j/(h_j^2 + {\rm stAni}^2\cdot u_j^2)$. The spatio-temporal anisotropy
is estimated beforehand and fixed at 118 km/day. This weighting scheme
puts higher confidence in lags filled with many pairs of spatio-temporal
locations, but respects to some degree the need of an accurate model for
short distances, as these short distances are the main source of
information in the prediction step. Note, that different weighting
schemes will in general result in different model parameters generating
different interpolation values. Our selection is based on the assumption
that well filled bins provide more reliable empirical variogram
estimates and the fact that short distances are the most important ones
for a local interpolation.

For comparison with classical approaches, we interpolate across Germany
iteratively for each single day using all available data for variogram
estimation. The purely spatial empirical variogram can directly be
obtained from the empirical spatio-temporal variogram, by fixing the
temporal lag at 0 separation. From the same set of variogram models as
investigated for the spatio-temporal models, the exponential model
(partial sill: 66.5, range: 224 km, nugget: 13.5) is the best suited
based on the optimisation criterion. Alternatively, we could have fitted
the spatial variogram for each day separately using observations from
that day only. However, given the small number of observation stations,
this produced unstable variograms for several days and we decided to use
the single spatial variogram derived from all spatio-temporal locations
treating time slices as uncorrelated copies of the spatial random field.

Once the best fitting spatio-temporal variogram model is identified, the
interpolation can be executed with the help of the function `krigeST`.
We use the sum-metric model that obtained the smallest RMSE (compare
Table [2](#tab:vgmFits)) to produce a gridded prediction. The
interpolation domain consists of daily values for a regular grid
spanning over Germany in UTM projection. The cell size is
$10~\rm{km}\times10~\rm{km}$. Figure [5](#fig:pred_daily) shows the
interpolated grid for the same days as Figure [2](#fig:dailyMeans)
alongside with all sampling locations. Additionally, maps depicting the
differences from a leave-one-out cross-validation are presented in
Figure [6](#fig:diffs_daily). A time series view is presented in
Figure [7](#fig:timeseries) showing the observed and predicted time
series at a single location along with its 95 % prediction intervals. An
animation of the entire year of daily mean ${\rm
  PM}_{10}$ prediction maps can be viewed online.[^3].

The interpolated maps are generated for a set of time stamps `tIDs` and
a grid over Germany `DE_pred` by

``` r
krigeST(PM10 ~ 1, data = DE_RB_2005[, tIDS], newdata = DE_pred, 
        fitSumMetricModel, nmax = 50, stAni = fitMetricModel$stAni / 24 / 3600)
```

To further compare the different approaches, a leave-one-out
cross-validation was carried out. The spatio-temporal interpolations are
done for the closest 50 and 10 neighbours assessing the impact of the
neighbourhood size. Inspection of the ranges of the variograms in the
temporal domain, suggests that any station more than at least 6 days
apart does not meaningfully contribute. Furthermore, the local
estimation allows the spatio-temporal random field to have a varying
mean value over space and time. The purely spatial interpolation can be
considered as the extreme temporally local case, where only observations
from the same time instance are considered.

# Results and discussion {#sec:resultsDiscuss}

In terms of added value of spatio-temporal kriging measured in
cross-validation results, Table [3](#tab:cv) shows hardly any benefit in
the illustrative example. This effect can to a large degree already be
explained from the spatio-temporal variograms: a temporal lag of one or
a few days leads already to a large variability compared to spatial
distances of few hundred kilometres, implying that the temporal
correlation is too weak to considerably improve the overall prediction.
Nevertheless, investigating a process with a higher temporal frequency
will likely show a stronger correlation in the temporal domain. Looking
into station-wise cross-validation statistics (not shown), the four
stations with an RMSE of 10 and larger correspond to the locations with
the largest annual mean concentrations ($>22~\mu{\rm g}/{\rm m}^3$).

The added value of spatio-temporal kriging lies in the flexibility of
the model. We are now in the position to not only interpolate at
unobserved locations in space, but also at unobserved time instances.
This makes spatio-temporal kriging a suitable tool to fill gaps in time
series not only based on the time series solely, but also including some
of its spatial neighbours. A very irregular sampled data set would as
well largely benefit from a spatio-temporal approach, as spatially close
but unobserved locations in one time slice are not of any help in a
purely spatial approach, but the spatio-temporal model would benefit
from the observed value nearby at another time instance. In a completely
regular data set, the distance to a spatio-temporal neighbour is at
least as large as the pure spatial distance and hence the correlation is
weaker. Furthermore, being able to capture the covariance structure over
space and time might foster a better understanding of the process under
study.

While we see spatio-temporal modelling as being a powerful tool, the
cross-validation results in Table [3](#tab:cv) show that spatio-temporal
kriging will not solve the problems of all poorly spatially captured
phenomena. Further preprocessing steps might be necessary to improve the
modelling of this $\rm{PM}_{10}$ data set such as for instance a
temporal AR-model followed by spatio-temporal residual kriging or using
further covariates in a preceding (linear) modelling step. Providing the
best possible model of $\rm{PM}_{10}$ concentrations across Germany was
beyond the scope of this paper.

The selection of a spatio-temporal covariance model should not only be
made based on the (weighted) mean squared difference between the
empirical and model variogram surfaces (presented in
Table [2](#tab:vgmFits)), but also on conceptional choices and visual
(Figure [3](#fig:allVgmsWireframe)) judgement of the fits. Even though
the function `fit.StVariogram` provides optimisation routines to fit
different spatio-temporal variogram models, the numerical routines in
the background may struggle to find the optimal parameters. Besides the
lower and upper boundaries of the parameter space, the control parameter
`parscale` of the `optim` function is a valuable option to improve the
convergence of the optimisation. With passing `parscale` as entry of the
list `control` a vector of scalars must be passed that controls the
different levels of magnitude of the variogram parameters. In most
applications, a change of 1 in the sills will have a stronger influence
on the variogram surface than a change of 1 in the ranges. The problem
becomes more difficult with an increasing number of parameters. In our
application, using the simple sum-metric model as starting values for
the full sum-metric model improved the convergence speed of the more
complex model. In the presented application, the sum-metric model turns
out to be the same as the simple sum-metric model. While this might at
first sight be due to using the simpler model to generate starting
values, different non simplified starting models converged to the same
result.

Generally, it is important to keep in mind the strong interaction of the
model parameters. It is typically not easy to distinguish how much of
the spatio-temporal nugget and sill is attributed to spatial, temporal
or joint components. In this paper we considered a joint numerical
approach, but step-wise approaches where the components are estimated
separately could as well be considered. The interested reader is also
referred to [@Nash2014]. However, all optimisation approaches follow the
premise that the studied process can be approximated with the given
model and available data. If this premise fails, no optimal model can be
selected.

An extension towards a restricted maximum likelihood method (REML) to
fit the spatio-temporal variogram model would be desirable, as it
overcomes some of the above mentioned drawbacks of the method of moments
based approaches and would additionally provide standard errors for the
parameter estimates. A REML approach would allow to take into account
that sample variogram values are correlated. However, for large data
sets (as in the spatio-temporal case), it is computationally more
feasible to use a least squares fitting. To reduce the correlation of
the variogram values, some randomisation could be implemented in large
data sets, to calculate the sample variogram based on partially
overlapping or even disjoint sets of observations.

The selected anisotropy as proxy to the relation of spatial and temporal
distance in determining the strongest correlated neighbours might show a
distortion for some models when only few neighbours are used towards the
true set of the most correlated locations. However, this effect vanishes
as soon as the spatio-temporal range of the model is sufficiently
represented through the set of nearest neighbours.

As mentioned by [@kj99], an alternative to space-time kriging might be
co-kriging. However, this is only feasible if the number of time
replicates is (very) small, as the number of cross-variograms to be
modelled equals the number of *pairs* of time replicates. Also,
co-kriging can only interpolate for these time slices, and not inbetween
or beyond them. It does however provide prediction error covariances,
which can help assessing the significance of estimated *change*
parameters [@pe1; @pe2]. Several of the space-time variograms presented
here may be approximated by sets of direct variograms and
cross-variograms.

Fitting variogram models to sample space-time variograms is in our
implementation done by `stats::optim`. Our example script uses method
`"L-BFGS-B"` and provides upper and lower parameter boundaries, e.g. to
make sure sill parameters do not become negative. There has been a lot
of research in optimisation since the development of the methods
included in `optim`, some of which has been reported in the special
issue of the Journal of Statistical Software [@optim], and we do see
potential to improve the options in this respect.

The approximate selection of the most correlated neighbours solves the
lack of a natural notion of a joint distance across space and time.
However, other sampling properties might introduce a bias in the
prediction. The prediction at an unobserved location with a cluster of
observations at one side will be biased towards this cluster and neglect
the locations towards the other directions. Similar as the quadrant
search in the pure spatial case an octant wise search strategy for the
local neighbourhood would solve this limitation. A simpler stepwise
approach to define an $n$-dimensional neighbourhood might already be
sufficient in which at first $n_s$ spatial neighbours and then from each
spatial neighbour $n_t$ time instances are selected, such that
$n_s \cdot n_t \approx n$.

The presented example considers stationary random fields that are
isotropic in space. Further extensions towards more sophisticated
variogram estimations allowing also for spatial geometric anisotropy are
desirable. One could for instance plot variogram maps for spatial
separation in North and South direction for each temporal lag. However,
the current implementation does not allow to use the anisotropy
parameter `anis` of the pure spatial variogram definition. Nevertheless,
a preliminary rescaling of coordinates would be a possible workaround.
This route has for instance been taken by @Gasch2015 performing 3D $+$ T
kriging. The soil profiles in their study show a clear difference in
horizontal and vertical variography. To correct for this, the depth
dimension of the data has been rescaled to correspond with the
dimensions of the horizontal distances beforehand. In the subsequent
study, these pseudo 3D coordinates have been used to fit the
spatio-temporal variograms and perform kriging.

The code in model definitions is meant to be kept both flexible and
simple. This is based on i) re-producing the notion of the
geostatistical models in the R code and in ii) reusing existing
definitions and functions of the pure spatial cases that have been
available for many years in *gstat*. The data handling benefits to a
large degree from the implementations in the *spacetime* R package.

# Conclusions {#sec:conclusions}

The spatio-temporal extensions to *gstat* allow to model a set of
spatio-temporal covariance functions. The implemented functionality
eases estimation, visualisation and understanding of spatio-temporal
covariance functions. The extension and reuse of already available
function structures and nomenclature facilitates an easy translation of
spatial workflows to handle spatio-temporal data. The numerical
estimation of the variogram parameters might be tricky and needs a large
degree of the user's attention. It is advised to carefully check the
outcome of the `optim` routine after optimisation. Spatio-temporal
kriging predictions can be made in a global and a local neighbourhood
set-up, while the latter will be the preferred solution for most
spatio-temporal data sets and common computer hardware configurations.

Spatio-temporal covariance structures carry valuable information, but a
spatio-temporal model is not guaranteed to outperform pure spatial
predictions. The benefit in terms of prediction quality of
spatio-temporal kriging becomes only apparent if sufficiently strong
correlated locations are added with the temporal dimension (i.e.  if the
model permits strong correlation across time). Nevertheless, the
spatio-temporal covariance model might be of interest in itself.

Besides some publications where the authors of this paper were involved
in, such as [@Kilibarda2014], the software presented here has proven
useful in several independent publications, examples of which are @marek
[@biondi; @hu; @yoon].

## Derivation of the separable covariance and variogram identities {#sec:derivSep}

The separable covariance and variogram identity is readily available
through
$$\begin{aligned}
C_{\rm sep}(h,u) &= C_{\rm s}(h)C_{\rm t}(u) = {\rm sill} \cdot \bar{c}_s(h)\bar{c}_t(u) \\
\gamma_{\rm sep}(h,u) &= C_{\rm sep}(0,0) - C_{\rm sep}(h,u) \\
 &= {\rm sill} \left(1- \bar{c}_s(h) \cdot \bar{c}_t(u) \right) \\
 &= {\rm sill} \left(1- \left(1-\bar{\gamma}_s(h)\right)\left(1-\bar{\gamma}_t(u)\right) \right) \\
 &= {\rm sill} \left(1- \left(1-\bar{\gamma}_s(h) -\bar{\gamma}_t(u) + \bar{\gamma}_s(h)\bar{\gamma}_t(u)\right) \right) \\
 &= {\rm sill} \left(\bar{\gamma}_s(h) + \bar{\gamma}_t(u) - \bar{\gamma}_s(h)\bar{\gamma}_t(u)\right)
\end{aligned}$$
where $\bar{c}$ and $\bar{\gamma}$ are normalised correlation and
correlogram functions respectively.

## Derivation of the product-sum covariance and variogram identities {#sec:derivPs}

The product-sum covariance and variogram identity is readily available
through:
$$\begin{aligned}
C_{\rm ps}(h,u) = & \ k \cdot C_{\rm s}(h)C_{\rm t}(u) + C_{\rm s}(h) + C_{\rm t}(u) \\
\gamma_{\rm ps}(h,u) = & \ C_{\rm ps}(0,0) - C_{\rm ps}(h,u) \\
 = & \ k \cdot C_{\rm s}(0)C_{\rm t}(0) + C_{\rm s}(0) + C_{\rm t}(0) \\
 &  - \left(k \cdot C_{\rm s}(h)C_{\rm t}(u) + C_{\rm s}(h) + C_{\rm t}(u)\right) \\
 = & \ k \cdot {\rm sill}_{\rm s} \cdot {\rm sill}_{\rm t} + {\rm sill}_{\rm s} + {\rm sill}_{\rm t} \\
 &  - k \cdot \left[ \left({\rm sill}_{\rm s} - \gamma_{\rm s}(h)\right)\left({\rm sill}_{\rm t} - \gamma_{\rm t}(u)\right)\right] - \left({\rm sill}_{\rm s} - \gamma_{\rm s}(h)\right) - \left({\rm sill}_{\rm t} - \gamma_{\rm t}(u)\right) \\
 = & \  k \cdot {\rm sill}_{\rm s} \cdot {\rm sill}_{\rm t} + {\rm sill}_{\rm s} + {\rm sill}_{\rm t} \\
 &   - k \cdot \left[ {\rm sill}_{\rm s} \cdot {\rm sill}_{\rm t} - {\rm sill}_{\rm s} \cdot \gamma_{\rm t}(u) - {\rm sill}_{\rm t} \cdot \gamma_{\rm s}(h) + \gamma_{\rm s}(h) \gamma_{\rm t}(u) \right] \\
 & - {\rm sill}_{\rm s} + \gamma_{\rm s}(h) - {\rm sill}_{\rm t} + \gamma_{\rm t}(u) \\
 = & \ k \cdot {\rm sill}_{\rm t} \gamma_{\rm s}(h) + k \cdot {\rm sill}_{\rm s} \gamma_{\rm t}(u) - k \gamma_{\rm s}(h) \gamma_{\rm t}(u) + \gamma_{\rm s}(h) + \gamma_{\rm t}(u) \\
 = & \ (k \cdot {\rm sill}_{\rm t} + 1) \gamma_{\rm s}(h) + (k \cdot {\rm sill}_{\rm s} + 1) \gamma_{\rm t}(u) - k \gamma_{\rm s}(h) \gamma_{\rm t}(u)
\end{aligned}$$
