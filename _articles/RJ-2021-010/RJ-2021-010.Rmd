title: A Fast and Scalable Implementation Method for Competing Risks Data with the
  R Package fastcmprsk
abstract: ' Advancements in medical informatics tools and high-throughput biological
  experimentation make large-scale biomedical data routinely accessible to researchers.
  Competing risks data are typical in biomedical studies where individuals are at
  risk to more than one cause (type of event) which can preclude the others from happening.
  The [@fine1999proportional] proportional subdistribution hazards model is a popular
  and well-appreciated model for competing risks data and is currently implemented
  in a number of statistical software packages. However, current implementations are
  not computationally scalable for large-scale competing risks data. We have developed
  an R package, [fastcmprsk](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=fastcmprsk), that
  uses a novel forward-backward scan algorithm to significantly reduce the computational
  complexity for parameter estimation by exploiting the structure of the subject-specific
  risk sets. Numerical studies compare the speed and scalability of our implementation
  to current methods for unpenalized and penalized Fine-Gray regression and show impressive
  gains in computational efficiency.'
