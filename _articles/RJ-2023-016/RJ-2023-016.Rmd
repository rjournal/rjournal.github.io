title: 'BayesPPD: An R Package for Bayesian Sample Size Determination Using the Power
  and Normalized Power Prior for Generalized Linear Models'
abstract: The R package BayesPPD (Bayesian Power Prior Design) supports Bayesian power
  and type I error calculation and model fitting after incorporating historical data
  with the power prior and the normalized power prior for generalized linear models
  (GLM). The package accommodates summary level data or subject level data with covariate
  information. It supports use of multiple historical datasets as well as design without
  historical data. Supported distributions for responses include normal, binary (Bernoulli/binomial),
  Poisson and exponential. The power parameter can be fixed or modeled as random using
  a normalized power prior for each of these distributions. In addition, the package
  supports the use of arbitrary sampling priors for computing Bayesian power and type
  I error rates. In addition to describing the statistical methodology and functions
  implemented in the package to enable sample size determination (SSD), we also demonstrate
  the use of BayesPPD in two comprehensive case studies.
