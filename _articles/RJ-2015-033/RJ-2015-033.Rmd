title: 'mmpp: A Package for Calculating Similarity and Distance Metrics for Simple
  and Marked Temporal Point Processes'
abstract: A simple temporal point process (SPP) is an important class of time series,
  where the sample realization of the process is solely composed of the times at which
  events occur. Particular examples of point process data are neuronal spike patterns
  or spike trains, and a large number of distance and similarity metrics for those
  data have been proposed. A marked point process (MPP) is an extension of a simple
  temporal point process, in which a certain vector valued mark is associated with
  each of the temporal points in the SPP. Analyses of MPPs are of practical importance
  because instances of MPPs include recordings of natural disasters such as earthquakes
  and tornadoes. In this paper, we introduce the R package mmpp, which implements
  a number of distance and similarity metrics for SPPs, and also extends those metrics
  for dealing with MPPs.
