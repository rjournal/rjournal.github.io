title: 'bcmixed: A Package for Median Inference on Longitudinal Data with the Box--Cox
  Transformation'
abstract: 'This article illustrates the use of the [*bcmixed*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=bcmixed)
  package and focuses on the two main functions: `bcmarg` and `bcmmrm`. The `bcmarg`
  function provides inference results for a marginal model of a mixed effect model
  using the Box--Cox transformation. The `bcmmrm` function provides model median inferences
  based on the mixed effect models for repeated measures analysis using the Box--Cox
  transformation for longitudinal randomized clinical trials. Using the `bcmmrm` function,
  analysis results with high power and high interpretability for treatment effects
  can be obtained for longitudinal randomized clinical trials with skewed outcomes.
  Further, the *bcmixed* package provides summarizing and visualization tools, which
  would be helpful to write clinical trial reports.'

# Introduction {#s:intro}

Longitudinal data are often observed in medical or biological research.
One of the most popular statistical models for studying longitudinal
continuous outcomes is the linear mixed effect model. Several packages
are available from CRAN that allow for the implementation of linear
mixed effects models (e.g.,
[*nlme*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=nlme) [@nlme],
[*glme*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=glme) [@glme],
[*lme4*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=lme4) [@lme4],
[*CLME*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=CLME) [@CLME],
[*PLmixed*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=PLmixed) [@PLmixed],
[*MCMCglmm*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=MCMCglmm)
[@MCMCglmm]).The linear mixed effect models assume that longitudinal
outcomes follow a multivariate normal distribution. However, the
distribution of the outcome is often right skewed in the medical and
biological fields. Therefore, evaluating fixed effects based on the
normal distribution theory may result in inefficient inferences such as
power loss for some statistical tests. In addition, although a
model-based mean for a certain level of the categorical exploratory
variables is often estimated when applying the linear mixed effect model
(e.g., the model-based mean for each treatment group of the last visit
in a randomized clinical trial), the mean may be inadequate as a
representative value for the skewed data.

The Box--Cox transformation [@box_cox_64] is often applied to skewed
longitudinal data [@lipsitz_etal_00] to reduce the skewness of a skewed
outcome and apply existing statistical models based on a normal
distribution. However, it is difficult to directly interpret the model
mean estimated on the scale after applying some transformations to the
outcome variable.

For the sake of the interpretability of the analysis results,
[@maruo_etal_15] propose a model median inference method on the original
scale based on the Box--Cox transformation in the context of randomized
clinical trials. [@maruo_etal_17] extend this method to the framework of
mixed effects models for repeated measures (MMRM) analysis
[@mallinckrodt_etal_01] in the context of longitudinal randomized
clinical trials.

The [*bcmixed*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=bcmixed) package
[@maruo_etal_20] contains functions to estimate model medians for
longitudinal data proposed by [@maruo_etal_17], as well as a sample data
set that is used in [@maruo_etal_17]. In this package, the parameter
estimation is conducted partially using the `gls` function in the
[*nlme*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=nlme) package. This paper
illustrates the usage of the package with the sample data in several
contexts.

The remainder of this manuscript is organized as follows: In section
[2](#s:methods), we describe the methods proposed by [@maruo_etal_17].
Then, we illustrate the usage of the *bcmixed* package with the example
data in section [3](#s:illustrations). Finally, our contributions are
summarized in section [4](#s:summary).

# Methods {#s:methods}

We briefly introduce the method proposed by in [@maruo_etal_17]. The
detailed expressions can be found in [@maruo_etal_17].

## Parameter inference for the Box--Cox model {#ss:model}

Let the outcome be a continuous and positive value. The outcomes are
measured over time for each subject $i=1,\ldots,n$, and the number of
planned measurement occasions is $T$ (occasion index: $t=1,\ldots,T$).
The outcome vector for the $i$th subject is denoted by
$\mathbf{y}_i=(y_{i1},\ldots,y_{in_i})^T$, where $n_i$ is the number of
measurements for the $i$th subject. We have $n_i\le T$ because of
missingness. Then, we consider applying the following model
[@lipsitz_etal_00; @box_cox_64]:
$$\label{model}
	\mathbf{z}_{i}=X_i\mathbf{\beta}+W_i\mathbf{b}_i+\mathbf{\epsilon}_i,   (\#eq:model)$$
where $\mathbf{z}_i$ is the Box--Cox transformed outcome vector such
that the $j$th element ($j=1,\ldots,n_i$) is denoted by
$$z_{ij}=\left\{\begin{array}{ll}
(y_{ij}^\lambda-1)/\lambda,&\lambda\neq 0,\\
\log y_{ij},&\lambda=0,
\end{array}
\right.$$
and $\lambda$ is the transformation parameter. The parameter
$\mathbf{\beta}$ is the $p$-dimensional vector of the fixed effect,
$\mathbf{b}_i$ is the $q$-dimensional vector of random effects
distributed as $MVN_q(\mathbf{0}_q, D)$, $\mathbf{\epsilon}_i$ is the
$n_i$-dimensional vector of random errors distributed independently as
$MVN_{n_i}(\mathbf{0}_{n_i}, \Sigma_i)$, and $X_i$ and $W_i$ are
$n_i \times p$ and $n_i \times q$ design matrices relating the fixed and
random effects, respectively. The random variables $\mathbf{b}_i$ and
$\mathbf{\epsilon}_i$ are independent. From Formula (\@ref(eq:model)),
it is derived that
$\mathbf{z}_i|\lambda\sim MVN_{n_i}(X_i\mathbf{\beta}, V_i$), where
$V_i =  W_i D W_i^T + \Sigma_i$. In this paper, we consider situations
where researchers have little interest in random effects and are
interested in assessing fixed effects. In such cases, a simple
formulation of the linear mixed effect model (\@ref(eq:model)) can be
implemented wherein the random effects are not explicitly modeled, but
are rather included as part of the covariance matrix $V_i$. We focus on
such a "marginal" mean model. The covariance parameter vector in $V=V_i$
for $n_i=T$ (i.e., subjects with no missing values) is denoted as
$\mathbf{\alpha}=(\alpha_1,\ldots,\alpha_m)^T$. The dimension of
$\mathbf{\alpha}$, that is $m$, depends on $T$ and the specified
covariance structure.

Let the model parameter vector be
$\mathbf{\theta}=(\lambda,\mathbf{\beta}^T,\mathbf{\alpha}^T)^T$. The
maximum likelihood estimate of $\mathbf{\theta}$ is obtained through
maximizing the profile likelihood for $\lambda$
[@lipsitz_etal_00; @maruo_etal_17]. The model-based and robust variance
estimators of the maximum likelihood estimator $\hat{\mathbf{\theta}}$
are given by $V_{\mathbf{\theta}}^{(M)}=\{-\hat{H}\}^{-1}$ and
$V_{\mathbf{\theta}}^{(R)}=\{-\hat{H}\}^{-1}\hat{J}\{-\hat{H}\}^{-1}$,
respectively, where
$H=\frac{\partial^2}{\partial\mathbf{\theta}\partial\mathbf{\theta}^T}l(\mathbf{\theta})$,
$J=\sum_{i=1}^n\left\{\frac{\partial}{\partial\mathbf{\theta}}l_i(\mathbf{\theta})\right\}\left\{\frac{\partial}{\partial\mathbf{\theta}}l_i(\mathbf{\theta})\right\}^T$,
$l(\mathbf{\theta})$ is the likelihood function for $n$ subjects, and
$l_i(\mathbf{\theta})$ is the likelihood function for the $i$th subject.
The matrices $\hat{H}$ and $\hat{J}$ are obtained from the matrices $H$
and $J$ by replacing $\mathbf{\theta}$ by $\hat{\mathbf{\theta}}$,
respectively. A robust variance estimator is an asymptotically valid
estimator even when the model (\@ref(eq:model)) is mis-specified
[@cox_61].

## Model median inference {#ss:median}

We now focus on the continuous and positive outcomes of a certain
disease, and consider a situation in which the efficacy of some
treatments (group index: $g=1,...,G$) is compared based on a randomized,
parallel group clinical trial, where the total number of subjects is
$n$. The explanatory variable matrix, $X_i$, and the fixed effect
parameter, $\mathbf{\beta}$ in model (\@ref(eq:model)) are denoted in
detail as follows. Now, $X_i$ is given by the $n_i\times(GT+C)$ matrix
that contains the intercept, $G-1$ group variables, $T-1$ occasion
variables, group-by-occasion interaction variables, and $C$ covariates,
where the categorical covariates are converted into dummy variables. The
fixed effect parameter vector is given by
$\mathbf{\beta}=(\beta_I,\mathbf{\beta}_g^T,\mathbf{\beta}_t^T,\mathbf{\beta}_{gt}^T,\mathbf{\beta}_c^T)^T$,
where $\beta_I$,
$\mathbf{\beta}_g=(\beta_{g(1)},\ldots,\beta_{g(G-1)})^T$,
$\mathbf{\beta}_t=(\beta_{t(1)},\ldots,\beta_{t(T-1)})^T$,
$\mathbf{\beta}_{gt}=(\beta_{gt(1,1)},\beta_{gt(1,2)},\ldots,\beta_{gt(G-1,T-1)})^T$,
and $\mathbf{\beta}_c=(\beta_{c(1)},\ldots,\beta_{c(C)})^T$ are the
intercept, group, occasion, group-by-occasion, and covariate parameter
vectors, respectively. Although group $G$ and occasion $T$ is set to be
at the reference level, we set
$\beta_{g(G)}=\beta_{t(T)}=\beta_{gt(G,t)}=\beta_{gt(g,T)}=0$ for the
sake of description ($g=1,\ldots,G,$ $t=1,\ldots,T$).

Under these settings, the model median, $\xi_{(g,t)}$, for the treatment
group $g$ at the occasion $t$ on the original scale is given by
$$\xi_{(g,t)}=\left\{\lambda\left(\beta_I+\beta_{g(g)}+\beta_{t(t)}+\beta_{gt(g,t)}+\mathbf{x}_{\bar{c}}^T\mathbf{\beta}_c\right)+1\right\}^{1/\lambda},$$
where $\mathbf{x}_{\bar{c}}$ is the vector of the mean of each covariate
for all subjects. The model median is the inverse Box--Cox
transformation of the model means on the Box--Cox transformed scale. The
model median can be easily interpreted because it is the estimator of
the median on the original scale.

Using the delta method, the variance estimator of the maximum likelihood
estimator for the model median, $\hat{\xi}_{(g,t)}$, is given by
$V_{\xi(g,t)}^{(\cdot)}=\Delta_{\xi(g,t)}^TV_{\mathbf{\theta}}^{(\cdot)}\Delta_{\xi(g,t)},$
where
$\Delta_{\xi(g,t)}=\left.\frac{\partial}{\partial\mathbf{\theta}}\xi_{(g,t)}\right|_{\mathbf{\theta}=\hat{\mathbf{\theta}}}$.
If we use $V_{\mathbf{\theta}}^{(\cdot)}=V_{\mathbf{\theta}}^{(M)}$, we
obtain the model-based variance estimator, $V_{\xi(g,t)}^{(M)}$. On the
other hand, the robust variance estimator, $V_{xi(g,t)}^{(R)}$, is
obtained if we use
$V_{\mathbf{\theta}}^{(\cdot)}=V_{\mathbf{\theta}}^{(R)}$.

Thus, the model median difference between groups $g_1$ and $g_2$ at
occasion $t$ is given by
$\delta_{(g_1;g_2,t)}=\xi_{(g_1,t)}-\xi_{(g_2,t)}$ and the variance
estimators of the maximum likelihood estimator of the model median
difference, $\hat{\delta}_{(g_1;g_2,t)}$, is given by
$V_{\delta(g_1;g_2,t)}=(\Delta_{(g_1,t)}-\Delta_{(g_2,t)})^TV_{\mathbf{\theta}}^{(\cdot)}(\Delta_{(g_1,t)}-\Delta_{(g_2,t)})$.
The model-based and robust variance estimators are obtained in the same
way as the model median estimator. Using the asymptotic normality of the
maximum likelihood estimator, the $100(1-\alpha)\%$ confidence interval
of $\delta_{(g_1;g_2,t)}$ is obtained as
$\hat{\delta}_{(g_1;g_2,t)}\pm \Phi^{-1}(1-\alpha/2)\sqrt{V_{\delta(g_1;g_2,t)}^{(\cdot)}}$,
where $\Phi^{-1}(\cdot)$ is the quantile function of the standard normal
distribution. The Wald-type test for the null hypothesis,
$\delta_{(g_1;g_2,t)}=0$, is performed with the test statistic
$t=\hat{\delta}_{(g_1;g_2,t)}/\sqrt{V_{\delta(g_1;g_2,t)}^{(\cdot)}}$.

The performances of the above-mentioned inference procedures may be low
for a small sample because these are based on the asymptotic properties
of the maximum likelihood estimation. Therefore, [@maruo_etal_17]
applied the following empirical small sample adjustment for the
inferences of the model median differences by referring to the study in
[@schluchter_elashoff_90].

They provide an adjusted standard error (SE) for the median difference
as $\sqrt{M/(M-p)V_{\delta(g_1;g_2,t)}^{(\cdot)}}$ for the compound
symmetry (CS) or the first-order auto regression (AR(1)) structure and
$\sqrt{n^*/(n^*-T)}$\
$\times\sqrt{V_{\delta(g_1;g_2,t)}^{(\cdot)}}$ for the unstructured (UN)
structure. Further, we approximate the null distribution by the $t$
distribution where the degrees of freedom for the CS or the AR(1)
structure and the UN structure are $(n-G)(T-1)-m$ and $n^*-T$,
respectively.

Although [@maruo_etal_17] and [@maruo_etal_20] focus only on the three
covariance structures, these three options are sufficient in the applied
settings because the MMRM analysis is often applied in the following
steps. The UN structure is used, and the CS or AR(1) structure with the
robust variance estimation is used when the parameter estimation process
is not properly converged (e.g., see [@gosho_etal_17]).

# Illustrations {#s:illustrations}

In this section, we describe the *bcmixed* package that provides the
analysis results based on the mixed effect models with the Box--Cox
transformation. The package *bcmixed* is available from the
Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN) at [https://
CRAN.R-project.org/package=bcmixed](https://
CRAN.R-project.org/package=bcmixed){.uri}. The package *bcmixed* can be
installed and loaded using the following code.

``` r
R> install.packages("bcmixed")
R> library(bcmixed)
```

In particular, the following main functions are demonstrated in this
article:

`bcmarg`

:   : Inference on the marginal model of the mixed effect model with the
    Box--Cox transformation.

`bcmmrm`

:   : Inference on the model median for longitudinal data in randomized
    clinical trials.

## Example data

First, we illustrate a real example for the acquired immune deficiency
syndrome (AIDS) clinical trial data, which is stored as the data frame
`aidscd4` in the *bcmixed* package. The data are from a randomized,
double-blind study of AIDS patients with advanced immune suppression
(cluster of differentiation 4 (CD4) cells count of less than or equal to
50 cells/mm3) [@henry_etal_98; @fitzmaurice_etal_11]. Patients in the
AIDS clinical trial group study 193A were randomized to dual or triple
combinations of human immunodeficiency virus-1 reverse transcriptase
inhibitors. In particular, the patients were randomized to one of four
daily regimens. The original data can be downloaded from
<https://content.sph.harvard.edu/fitzmaur/ala/> (Datasets-\>AIDS
Clinical Trial Group (ACTG) Study 193A). As for the more detailed data
handling process, see [@maruo_etal_17]. The data frame `aidscd4`
contains seven variables (Table [1](#tab:data)).

  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  : Table 3: Values of `bcmarg` function
:::

In `bcmarg` function, `lambda` is estimated with the `optimize` function
by maximizing the profile likelihood function for $\lambda$. If an error
occurs in the `optimize` function, problems may be solved by changing
the search area for $\lambda$, `lmdint`.

#### Example code:

We applied a marginal model to the `aidscd4` data, where the fixed
effects were the treatment, visit, treatment-visit interaction, and the
Box--Cox transformed baseline, where the visit was treated as a nominal
variable. The covariance structure was set as unstructured (default
setting). This model is frequently used for MMRM analysis. A sample code
is as follows. The `bct.v` function returns the Box--Cox transformed
vector.

``` r
R> data("aidscd4")
R> aidscd4$cd4.bl.tr <- bct.v(aidscd4$cd4.bl)$transformed
R> res1 <- bcmarg(formula = cd4 ~ as.factor(treatment) * as.factor(weekc) + 
+                 cd4.bl.tr, data = aidscd4, time = weekc, id = id)
```

The summarized analysis results on the transformed scale are obtained by
applying the `summary` function to the `"bcmarg"` object as follows.

``` r
R> summary(res1)

The results of coefficients on the transformed scale are obtained with
the `gls` function in the
[*nlme*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=nlme) package. The
transformation parameter was estimated as 0.154, which suggested that
the shape of the residual distribution was close to a multivariate
log-normal distribution. All main effects were significant; however,
treatment-by-week interaction was not significant at a level of 0.05.
Note that inference results for `beta` under the assumption that the
transformation parameter is known are provided. Although statistical
tests would be asymptotically valid (e.g., see [@doksum_wong_83]),
standard errors might be underestimated (e.g., see [@bickel_doksum_81]).

## bcmmrm function

This function provides the results for the model median inferences for
longitudinal randomized clinical trial data described in Section
[2.2](#ss:median). The parameter inference is conducted by calling the
`bcmarg` function in the `bcmmrm` function.

#### Usage:

The `bcmmrm` function is called using the following syntax.

``` r
bcmmrm(outcome, group, data, time = NULL, id = NULL, covv = NULL, 
  cfactor = NULL, structure = "UN", lmdint = c(-3, 3), glabel = NULL, 
  tlabel = NULL)
```

The `bcmmrm` function takes arguments tablated in Table
[4](#tab:arg_bcmmrm).

  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  : Table 5: Values of `bcmmrm` function
:::

`lambda`, `R`, `betainf`, and `inf.marg` are obtained from the results
of the `bcmarg` function that is called in the `bcmmrm` function.

#### Sample code:

We applied the MMRM analysis with the Box--Cox transformation described
in Section [3.2](#ss:bcmarg) to the `aidscd4` data, where the Box--Cox
transformed baseline and sex were included as the covariates. The
example code is as follows.

``` r
R> data("aidscd4")
R> aidscd4$cd4.bl.tr <- bct.v(aidscd4$cd4.bl)$transformed
R> res2 <- bcmmrm(outcome = cd4, group = treatment, data = aidscd4, time = weekc, 
+                id = id, covv = c("cd4.bl.tr", "sex"),  cfactor = c(0, 1), 
+                glabel = c("Zid/Did", "Zid+Zal", "Zid+Did", "Zid+Did+Nev")
```

The transformed baseline and sex are continuous and categorical
variables, respectively, and therefore, `cfactor` was set as `c(0,1)`.

The `print` function only provides information about model detail, the
estimated transformation parameter, the maximized log-likelihood, and
the model median estimate for each time point and group as follows.

``` r
R> print(res2)

follows.

Significant differences were detected for the following pairs Zid+Did
vs. Zid/Did, Zid+Did+Nev vs. Zid/Did, Zid+Did+Nev vs. Zid+Zal, and
Zid+Did+Nev vs. Zid+Did at week 32.

The `summary` function provides the results using the robust variance
and the small sample adjustment in the default settings. If users want
to summarize results using the model variance and not using the small
sample adjustment, specify
`summary(bcmmrmObject, robust = F, ssadjust = F)`. Further details of
the `summary` function for the `"bcmmrm"` object can be obtained with
`?summary.bcmmrm`.

The inference results for the median differences at week 32 (fourth
visit) can also be called as follows although the levels of the group
variable in the data frame are used without formatting.

``` r

```

The `"bcmmrm"` object can be plotted with the `plot` function as follows
(Figure [2](#fig:long)).

![Figure 2: Longitudinal plot of model median for each group, created by
applying `plot` function to `bcmmrm` object.](long.png){#fig:long
width="100%" alt="graphic without alt text"}

``` r
R> plot(res2, xlab = "Week", ylab = "CD4+1")
```

The `plot` function provides a longitudinal plot in the default
settings. However, a plot at a specified time point can be drawn with
the following code (Figure [3](#fig:median32)):

``` r
R> plot(res2, timepoint = 32, xlab = "Treatment", ylab = "CD4+1", col = 1:4)
```

![Figure 3: Plot of model median for each group at week 32, created by
applying `plot` function to `bcmmrm` object with `timepoint`
option.](median32.png){#fig:median32 width="100%"
alt="graphic without alt text"}

Further, the `plot` function provides the results using the robust
variance and the small sample adjustment in the default setting. Many
other options such as `main` and `legend` can be used in the `plot`
function. Further details can be obtained with `?plot.bcmmrm`.

A diagnosis of a model fitting can be conducted with the `boxplot`
function, which provides a box-whisker plot of the Box--Cox transformed
residuals for each group. A sample code is provided as follows (Figure
[4](#fig:boxplot)):

``` r
R> boxplot(res2)
```

![Figure 4: Box-whisker plot of transformed residuals for each group at
week 32, created by applying `boxplot` function to `bcmmrm`
object.](boxplot.png){#fig:boxplot width="100%"
alt="graphic without alt text"}

The shape of the transformed residual for each group is not skewed and
the median and mean are close to each other, which suggests that the
median would not be biased at week 32. The `boxplot` function provides
the results at the last time points in the default settings. A
box-whisker plot at another time point can be obtained by specifying
`boxplot(bcmmrmObject, timepoint = xx)`.

# Summary and discussion {#s:summary}

We demonstrated the use of the *bcmixed* package. The `bcmarg` function
provides the analysis results for a marginal model of a mixed effect
model with the Box--Cox transformation. The results for the statistical
test of the `bcmarg` function are meaningful. However, it is difficult
to interpret coefficients ($\mathbf{\beta}$) on the transformed scale.

The `bcmmrm` function provides the model median inferences based on the
MMRM with the Box--Cox transformation for longitudinal randomized
clinical trials. Using this function, treatment effects can be
interpreted as median differences between treatment groups at specified
time points. [@maruo_etal_17] also show that this method controls the
type I error of the statistical test for the model median difference,
and it has moderate or high performance for power compared with the
existing methods (ordinary MMRM, MMRM for the log-transformed outcome,
etc.) from their simulation studies (the simulation program is provided
in <https://github.com/kzkzmr/Maruo_2017_StatMed_Simulation> with
penalized power results proposed by [@cavus_etal_19]). Thus, `bcmmrm`
function analysis results with high power and high interpretability for
longitudinal randomized clinical trials with skewed outcomes. Further,
the `bcmmrm` function provides summarizing and visualization tools,
which would be helpful to write clinical trial reports.

Although the *bcmixed* package can be used for data other than that of
randomized clinical trials, the performances of these methods have not
been evaluated well yet. Therefore, users should use them carefully.
Although a model fitting can be diagnosed with the `boxplot` function,
more model diagnosis tools may be implemented in the future. Users might
apply the [*MissMech*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=MissMech)
package[@jamshidian_etal_14; @jamshidian_etal_15], which diagnoses
multivariate normality and heteroscedasticity, to the transformed
residuals stored in `"bcmarg"` object. Note that the *MissMech* package
assumes missing mechanisms are missing completely at random (MCAR), and
statistical tests for model fittings may lead to significant results for
a medium-to-large sample even when the models fit the data adequately.
