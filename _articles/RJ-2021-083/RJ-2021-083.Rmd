title: 'bcmixed: A Package for Median Inference on Longitudinal Data with the Box–Cox
  Transformation'
abstract: 'This article illustrates the use of the bcmixed package and focuses on
  the two main functions: bcmarg and bcmmrm. The bcmarg function provides inference
  results for a marginal model of a mixed ef fect model using the Box–Cox transformation.
  The bcmmrm function provides model median inferences based on the mixed effect models
  for repeated measures analysis using the Box–Cox transformation for longitudinal
  randomized clinical trials. Using the bcmmrm function, analysis results with high
  power and high interpretability for treatment effects can be obtained for longitudinal
  randomized clinical trials with skewed outcomes. Further, the bcmixed package provides
  summarizing and visualization tools, which would be helpful to write clinical trial
  reports.'
