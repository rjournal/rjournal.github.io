title: 'adegraphics: An S4 Lattice-Based Package for the Representation of Multivariate
  Data'
abstract: The ade4 package provides tools for multivariate analyses. Whereas new statistical
  methods have been added regularly in the package since its first release in 2002,
  the graphical functions, that are used to display the main outputs of an analysis,
  have not benefited from such enhancements. In this context, the adegraphics package,
  available on CRAN since 2015, is a complete reimplementation of the ade4 graphical
  functionalities but with large improvements. The package uses the S4 object system
  (each graph is an object) and is based on the graphical framework provided by lattice
  and grid. We give a brief description of the package and illustrate some important
  functionalities to build elegant graphs.
