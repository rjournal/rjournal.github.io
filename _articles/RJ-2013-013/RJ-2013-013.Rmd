title: Estimating Spatial Probit Models in R
abstract: In this article we present the Bayesian estimation of spatial probit models
  in R and provide an implementation in the package spatialprobit. We show that large
  probit models can be estimated with sparse matrix representations and Gibbs sampling
  of a truncated multivariate normal distribution with the precision matrix. We present
  three examples and point to ways to achieve further performance gains through parallelization
  of the Markov Chain Monte Carlo approach.
