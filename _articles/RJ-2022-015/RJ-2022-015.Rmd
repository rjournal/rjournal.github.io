title: 'FMM: An R Package for Modeling Rhythmic Patterns in Oscillatory Systems'
abstract: This paper is dedicated to the R package FMM which implements a novel approach
  to describe rhythmic patterns in oscillatory signals. The frequency modulated Möbius
  (FMM) model is defined as a parametric signal plus a Gaussian noise, where the signal
  can be described as a single or a sum of waves. The FMM approach is flexible enough
  to describe a great variety of rhythmic patterns. The FMM package includes all required
  functions to fit and explore single and multi-wave FMM models, as well as a restricted
  version that allows equality constraints between parameters representing a priori
  knowledge about the shape to be included. Moreover, the FMM package can generate
  synthetic data and visualize the results of the fitting process. The potential of
  this methodology is illustrated with examples of such biological oscillations as
  the circadian rhythm in gene expression, the electrical activity of the heartbeat
  and the neuronal activity.
