title: 'etrm: Energy Trading and Risk Management in R'
abstract: ' This paper introduces [etrm](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=etrm),
  an R package with tools for trading and financial risk management in energy markets.
  Contracts for electric power and natural gas differ from most other commodities
  due to the fact that physical delivery takes place over a time interval, and not
  at a specific point in time. There is typically strong seasonality, limited storage
  and transmission capacity and strong correlation between price and required volume.
  Such characteristics need to be taken into account when pricing contracts and managing
  financial risk related to energy procurement. Tools for these task are usually bundled
  into proprietary Energy Trading Risk Management (ETRM) systems delivered by specialized
  IT vendors. The [etrm](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=etrm) package offers a
  transparent solution for building a forward price curve for energy commodities which
  is consistent with methods widely used in the industry. The user''s fundamental
  market view may be combined with contract price quotes to form a forward curve that
  replicate current market prices, as described in @ollmar2003analysis and @benth2007extracting.
  [etrm](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=etrm) also provides implementations of
  five portfolio insurance trading strategies for energy price risk management. The
  forward market curve and the energy price hedging strategies are core elements in
  an ETRM system, which to the best of the author''s knowledge has not been previously
  available in the R ecosystem. '
