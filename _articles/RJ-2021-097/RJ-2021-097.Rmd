title: 'BayesSenMC: an R package for Bayesian Sensitivity Analysis of Misclassification'
abstract: In case--control studies, the odds ratio is commonly used to summarize the
  association between a binary exposure and a dichotomous outcome. However, exposure
  misclassification frequently appears in case--control studies due to inaccurate
  data reporting, which can produce bias in measures of association. In this article,
  we implement a Bayesian sensitivity analysis of misclassification to provide a full
  posterior inference on the corrected odds ratio under both non-differential and
  differential misclassification. We present an [R]{.sans-serif} [@R] package [*BayesSenMC*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=BayesSenMC),
  which provides user-friendly functions for its implementation. The usage is illustrated
  by a real data analysis on the association between bipolar disorder and rheumatoid
  arthritis.

# Introduction {#Introduction}

Many epidemiological studies are concerned with assessing the risk of an
outcome between exposed and non-exposed subjects. For example, in a
case--control study, researchers first identify subjects who have the
disease of interest (the case group) and subjects who do not (the
control group), and then ascertain the exposure status of the subjects
in each group. The odds ratio is typically used to assess the
association between the exposure and disease in the case--control study;
it describes the ratio of the exposure odds in the case group to that in
the control group.

However, misclassification of exposure, disease outcome, or covariates
appears frequently in observational studies of epidemiological or
medical research [@Rothman2008; @brakenhoff2018measurement]. In a
case--control study, misclassification is often due to inaccurate
reporting of the exposure status (e.g., self-reported data). This can
consequently lead to biased estimation of exposure probabilities and
odds ratio. To adjust for such biases, we can correct the odds ratio
using the observed data from the case--control study and the sensitivity
and specificity of correctly classifying exposure status from external
data. Here, the sensitivity is the proportion of exposed subjects that
are correctly classified as exposed (i.e., true positive), and the
specificity is the proportion of non-exposed subjects that are correctly
classified as non-exposed (i.e., true negative).

Quantitative assessment of misclassification bias is necessary to
estimate uncertainty in study results. There are many statistical
methods for misclassification correction; nearly all of them use prior
information that maps observed measurements to true values
[@Greenland2005]. These methods include regression calibration and
multiple imputation [@Rosner1989; @Spiegelman2001; @Cole2006], in which
the mapping is based on a validation study. Also, sensitivity analysis
can be used to evaluate the effects of uncertainties in measurement on
the observed results of the study [@Greenland1996; @Lash2003; @Chu2006],
in which the mapping from observed to true measurements may be based on
prior information or expert opinion about the accuracy of the
measurement. However, when such information or opinion is lacking,
researchers may over- or under-adjust for misclassification with an
inaccurate guess, which may, in turn, produce a poor estimate
[@Gustafson2006].

Moreover, despite the ubiquity of measurement error, these methods
remain rarely used due to the complexity of statistical approaches,
especially the complexity of prior specifications as well as the lack of
software packages [@Lash2003]. For example, in a random sample survey of
57 epidemiological studies [@Jurek2006], only one study used
quantitative corrections. Sensitivity analysis is simple but limited
insofar as it does not provide formal interval estimates that combine
uncertainty due to random error with misclassification. Several authors
have addressed this deficiency by using probabilistic (Monte Carlo)
sensitivity analyses [@Greenland2005]. For example, @Fox2005 proposed a
probabilistic sensitivity analysis of misclassified binary variables
based on multiple imputation; they provided SAS code and Excel macro for
this approach. Such methods can be viewed as means of summarizing the
bias over sensitivity analyses using a prior distribution about the bias
parameters [@Greenland2005]. Many of them have been implemented in the
[R]{.sans-serif} package
[*episensr*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=episensr) [@episensr].
Specifically, *episensr* allows for specifications of prior
distributions for sensitivity and specificity, such as uniform and logit
normal, as well as sequential bias modeling that can be applied to more
than one type of bias, such as for both misclassification and selection
biases.

Other methods employ a Bayesian implementation of the probabilistic bias
analysis or perform an outright Bayesian analysis
[@Greenland2005; @Chu2006; @MacLehose2012; @Gustafson2006]. The Bayesian
analysis is substantially different from conventional probabilistic
sensitivity analysis and much more flexible for incorporating different
types of priors. However, it is often computationally expensive and more
difficult to conduct by general users without a statistical background.
@Gustafson2006 accounted for the prior uncertainties of sensitivity and
specificity in the evaluation of the results of a case--control study.
@MacLehose2012 compared a Bayesian approach with probabilistic bias
analysis based on a case--control study of congenital defects,
concluding that the two approaches are mostly similar if using similar
prior data admissibility as well as uniform priors on exposure
probabilities.

This article focuses on an [R]{.sans-serif} package correcting for
exposure misclassification in a case--control study. Extending from the
Bayesian approach introduced by @Gustafson2006, we implement the methods
outlined in @Chu2006, which account for the correlation between the
sensitivity and specificity in the model specification. The methods can
be applied to both non-differential and differential misclassification;
that is, the degree of misclassification can be the same across the case
and control groups or distinctly different. Furthermore, we use the
generalized linear mixed bivariate effects model introduced by @Chu2010
to jointly model the sensitivity and specificity that may be informed by
an external meta-analysis on the diagnostic accuracy of the exposure
factor.

This article introduces the implementation of the methods for
misclassification via our [R]{.sans-serif} package *BayesSenMC*
(Bayesian sensitivity analysis by Monte Carlo sampling). The package is
mainly implemented in [Stan]{.sans-serif}, an imperative probabilistic
programming language, which uses Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC), a form
of efficient Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling.

# An illustrative example {#sec:example}

This section presents an illustrative case--control study on the
association between bipolar disorder and rheumatoid arthritis,
originally investigated by @Farhi2016; this example will also be used to
demonstrate the implementation of the methods for misclassification. The
exposure is bipolar disorder, and the disease outcome is rheumatoid
arthritis, which is a chronic autoimmune disorder that primarily affects
joints and occurs in nearly 1% of the population in developed countries
[@mcinnes2017pathogenetic]. TableÂ [1](#table:RA) presents the data.

::: {#table:RA}

  ---------------------- ------------------ ----------- --------

  : Table 1: Counts of the case--control study of the association
  between bipolar disorder and rheumatoid arthritis.
:::

The unadjusted odds ratio is 1.34 with the 95% confidence interval (CI)
(1.02, 1.76), indicating a significant association between rheumatoid
arthritis and bipolar disorder. Of note, @Farhi2016 acknowledged the
limitation that "lack of validation of the diagnosis of bipolar disorder
in the subjects cannot be completely excluded." For example, bipolar
disorder can be classified as type I, type II, etc.; it is especially
difficult to diagnose bipolar disorder type II [@phillips2013bipolar].

Assuming certain fixed values or prior distributions of sensitivity and
specificity, we can use the method by @Chu2006 to correct the odds ratio
accounting for the exposure misclassification. The sensitivity and
specificity can be either some fixed values or random variables
following some prior distributions.

The prior distributions can be estimated from external evidence using a
meta-analysis, e.g., using the bivariate generalized linear mixed model
approach proposed by @Chu2010. The following section presents the
details of these methods. This article uses the meta-analysis performed
by @Carvalho2015 to obtain the prior distributions of the sensitivity
and specificity of classifying the exposure status of bipolar disorder.
The meta-analysis contains three subgroups of screening detection
instruments: bipolar spectrum diagnostic scale (8 studies with
sensitivity between 0.52 and 0.90 and specificity between 0.51 and
0.97), hypomania checklist (17 studies with sensitivity between 0.69 and
1.00 and specificity between 0.36 and 0.98), and mood disorder
questionnaire (30 studies with sensitivity between 0.00 and 0.91 and
specificity between 0.47 and 1.00). The dataset from the Clalit Health
Services (the largest Health Maintenance Organization in Israel) used in
@Farhi2016 does not specify the exact screening detection instrument for
identifying the bipolar disorder. Therefore, we will use all three
subgroups' data (55 studies in total) in @Carvalho2015 for our analysis
on the sensitivity and specificity. A subset of the meta-analysis data
is shown in TableÂ [2](#table:meta).

According to their definitions, the study-specific sensitivity and
specificity can be estimated as (the number of true positives) / (the
number of true positives plus the number of false negatives) and (the
number of true negatives) / (the number of true negatives plus the
number of false positives). For example, studyÂ 1 gives the sensitivity
81/(81 + 9) = 0.90 and the specificity 444/(444 + 427) $\approx$ 0.51.
The generalized linear mixed-effects model will be used to synthesize
all 55 studies to estimate the overall sensitivity and specificity.

# Methods {#sec:Methods}

In this section, we introduce the specific models and methods to deal
with misclassification.

## Bayesian approach to correcting misclassification bias {#sec:orcorrected}

Consider a case--control study, and we are interested in the odds ratio
from this study. TableÂ [3](#table:observed) presents the notation of the
observed data. The odds ratio is estimated as
$$\widehat{\text{OR}} = \frac{ad}{bc}.$$
When the odds ratio is larger or smaller than 1, the exposure happens
more or less likely in the case group, suggesting an association between
the disease status and the exposure status. On the other hand, the odds
ratio close to 1 suggests that the disease and the exposure are less
likely associated.

   Control     $c$        $d$      $N_0$
  ---------------------------------------

  : Table 3: Observed counts of a case--control study.
:::

Assume that the observed exposure probability is $P_k$, the true
exposure probability is $\pi_k$, the sensitivity is $Se_k$, and the
specificity is $Sp_k$ for group $k$ ($k$ = 1 for the case group and 0
for the control group) in the case--control study. Then, we can
represent the observed exposure probability in terms of the true
exposure probability, the sensitivity, and the specificity:
$$\begin{aligned}
\begin{split}
    \label{eq:ObsExposed}
	P_k &= \mathsf{P}(\text{observed E in group }k)\\
    &= \mathsf{P}(\text{observed E} \mid \text{true E in group }k) \mathsf{P}(\text{true E in group }k) \\
    & \quad + \mathsf{P}(\text{observed E} \mid \text{true } \overline{E} \text{ in group }k) \mathsf{P}(\text{true} \overline{E} \text{ in group }k)\\
    &= {Se}_k \pi_k + (1 - {Sp}_k) (1 - \pi_k),
\end{split}
\end{aligned}   (\#eq:ObsExposed)$$
where $E$ denotes exposure and $\overline{E}$ denotes non-exposure. This
yields
$$\pi_k = (P_K + {Sp}_k - 1)/({Se}_k + {Sp}_k - 1).$$
Consequently, the misclassification-corrected odds ratio can be
calculated as
$$\label{eq:CorrectedOR}
	\text{OR}_\text{c} = \frac{\pi_1 / (1 - \pi_1)}{\pi_0 / (1 - \pi_0)}
	=\frac{(P_1+Sp_1-1)(Se_0-P_0)}{(P_0+Sp_0-1)(Se_1-P_1)}.   (\#eq:CorrectedOR)$$

Based on EquationÂ (\@ref(eq:ObsExposed)), we can specify the following
Bayesian hierarchical model to estimate the corrected odds ratio of the
case--control study, with $a$ and $c$ being the observed counts from
Table [3](#table:observed):
$$\begin{aligned}
\begin{split}
\label{eq:bayes}
\text{Likelihood:}& \quad a \sim Bin(N_1, P_1) \text{ and } c \sim Bin(N_0, P_0);\\
\text{Link:}& \quad P_k = {Se}_k \pi_k + (1 - {Sp}_k) (1 - \pi_k), \quad k = 0, 1;\\
& \quad \text{LOR}_\text{c} = \text{logit}(\pi_1) - \text{logit}(\pi_0) \text{ and } \text{OR}_\text{c} = \exp (\text{LOR}_\text{c});\\
\text{Prior:}& \quad \text{logit}(\pi_0) \sim N(0, 10^2) \text{ and } \text{LOR}_\text{c} \sim N(0, 2^2);\\
& \quad {Se}_k, {Sp}_k \sim f(\cdot).
\end{split}
\end{aligned}   (\#eq:bayes)$$
Here, we assume weakly-informative priors for the true exposure
probabilities $\pi_0$ and $\pi_1$, which give a 95% CI of the true odds
ratio between $e^{-2 \times 1.96}$ ($\approx$ 0.02) and
$e^{2 \times 1.96}$ ($\approx$ 50.40), and a binomial distribution for
the number of observed exposure in case and control studies. Thus, the
Bayesian inference can be formulated as a posterior distribution of
$\pi_0$, $\pi_1$, and the corrected odds ratio.

Additionally, the function $f(\cdot)$ denotes the joint prior for the
sensitivity and specificity (for either non-differential or different
misclassification). In practice, the sensitivity and specificity are not
available from the case--control study, and they may be estimated as
certain fixed values by subjective experts' opinions.

Alternatively, we may consider incorporating evidence-based prior
information from existing studies on the diagnostic accuracy of the
exposure status (e.g., the data in TableÂ [2](#table:meta)). This allows
us to account for uncertainties in the sensitivity and specificity and
potential correlation between them. The next subsection presents methods
to obtain the prior information for the sensitivity and specificity from
a meta-analysis.

## Estimating prior distributions on the sensitivity and specificity from a meta-analysis {#sec:prior}

This section briefly discusses the generalized linear mixed-effects
model (GLMM) to estimate priors on the sensitivity and specificity.
Suppose that a meta-analysis on the diagnostic accuracy of the exposure
status is available as external data to inform the priors of sensitivity
and specificity that are needed to correct the odds ratio in the
case--control study. Denote the number of independent studies in the
meta-analysis by $m$, and let $n_{i11}$, $n_{i00}$, $n_{i01}$, and
$n_{i10}$ be the number of true positives, true negatives, false
positives, and false negatives, respectively, in study $i$
($i = 1, \ldots, m$). Consequently, there are $n_{i11} + n_{i10}$ truly
exposed subjects and $n_{i00} + n_{i01}$ truly unexposed subjects.

Assuming that $n_{i11}$ and $n_{i00}$ follow binomial distributions
given the number of exposed and unexposed subjects, respectively, the
bivariate GLMM can be specified as [@Chu2010; @ma2016statistical]:
$$\begin{aligned}
\begin{split}
\label{eq:glmm}
& \quad n_{i11} \sim Bin(n_{i11} + n_{i10}, Se_i) \text{ and } n_{i00} \sim Bin(n_{i00} + n_{i01}, Sp_i), \quad i = 1, \ldots, m;\\
& \quad g \left(\frac{Se_i - Se^L}{Se^U - Se^L}\right) = u + \mu_i \text{ and } g \left(\frac{Sp_i - Sp^L}{Sp^U - Sp^L}\right) = v + \nu_i;\\
& \quad
\begin{bmatrix}
\mu_i\\
\nu_i
\end{bmatrix} \sim N \left(
\begin{bmatrix}
0\\
0
\end{bmatrix}
,
\begin{bmatrix}
\sigma^2_\mu & \rho\sigma_\mu\sigma_\nu \\
\rho\sigma_\mu\sigma_\nu & \sigma^2_\nu
\end{bmatrix}
\right),
\end{split}
\end{aligned}   (\#eq:glmm)$$
where $u$ and $v$ are the fixed effects implying the overall sensitivity
and specificity in all $m$ studies, and $\mu_i$ and $\nu_i$ are the
study-specific random effects. Also, $\sigma_\mu^2$ and $\sigma_\nu^2$
describe the heterogeneity of the underlying sensitivity and specificity
across studies, and $\rho$ models the correlation between the
sensitivity and specificity. We denote the estimated fixed effects by
$\hat{u}$ and $\hat{v}$, the estimated variances as $\hat{\sigma}_\mu^2$
and $\hat{\sigma}_\nu^2$, and the estimated correlation coefficient as
$\hat{\rho}$.

The lower and upper bounds $Se^L$, $Se^U$, $Sp^L$, and $Sp^U$ provide
constraints on sensitivity and specificity, which are chosen to exclude
all improbable values. A smaller difference between $Se^L$ and $Se^U$
(or between $Sp^L$ and $Sp^U$) indicates higher confidence in the
diagnostic accuracy of the exposure status. When there is no confidence
for the range, we can set $Se^L = Sp^L = 0$ and $Se^U = Sp^U = 1$.
Alternatively, setting $Se^L = Sp^L = 0.5$ indicates that the diagnosis
of exposure is better than chance. For simplicity of implementation, we
only allow the same lower and upper bounds for $Se$ and for $Sp$ in our
package *BayesSenMC*. In addition, $g(\cdot)$ is the link function
(e.g., the logit, probit, and complementary log-log). The logit link,
$\text{logit}(t) = \log \frac{t}{1 - t}$, is commonly used in practice,
and our package *BayesSenMC* adopts this link.

Recall that the Bayesian hierarchical model for estimating the corrected
odds ratio in the case--control study in EquationÂ (\@ref(eq:bayes))
specifies a joint prior $f(\cdot)$ for the sensitivity and specificity.
We consider six specifications for this prior as follows:

-   Crude (uncorrected) odds ratio: no misclassification. The
    specification of the prior is equivalent to setting
    $Se_0 = Se_1 = Sp_0 = Sp_1 = 1$. Consequently, $P_1 = \pi_1$ and
    $P_0 = \pi_0$.
-   Corrected OR: misclassification of the exposure status exists, and
    the sensitivity and specificity for both cases and controls are
    assumed to be fixed values. These fixed values can be directly
    plugged in the Bayesian model in EquationÂ (\@ref(eq:bayes)).
-   Logit-prior corrected OR: non-differential misclassification of the
    exposure status exists ($Se_0 = Se_1 = Se$ and $Sp_0 = Sp_1 = Sp$),
    and the uncertainties of the sensitivity and specificity are
    considered independently by using normal priors on the logit scale.
    The evidence of the priors comes from the diagnostic meta-analysis
    performed in the GLMM in EquationÂ (\@ref(eq:glmm)). Specifically, we
    can assign
    $$\text{logit}\left(\frac{Se - Se^L}{Se^U - Se^L}\right) \sim N(\hat{u}, \hat{\sigma}_{\mu}^2) \text{ and } 
    \text{logit}\left(\frac{Sp - Sp^L}{Sp^U - Sp^L}\right) \sim N(\hat{v}, \hat{\sigma}_{\nu}^2)$$
    as the priors in the Bayesian hierarchical model for the
    case--control study in EquationÂ (\@ref(eq:bayes)).
-   Fixed-correlation corrected OR: non-differential misclassification
    of the exposure status exists ($Se_0 = Se_1 = Se$ and
    $Sp_0 = Sp_1 = Sp$), and the sensitivity and specificity have a
    joint normal prior on the logit scale to account for their
    correlation. In practice, the sensitivity is very likely correlated
    with the specificity when dichotomizing a continuous measurement
    [@chu2006bivariate]. Specifically, we use the following bivariate
    joint prior
    $$\begin{bmatrix}
    \text{logit}\left(\frac{Se - Se^L}{Se^U - Se^L}\right) \\
    \text{logit}\left(\frac{Sp - Sp^L}{Sp^U - Sp^L}\right)
    \end{bmatrix}
    \sim
    N \left(
    \begin{bmatrix}
    \hat{u}\\
    \hat{v}
    \end{bmatrix}
    ,
    \begin{bmatrix}
    \hat{\sigma}_{\mu}^2 & \hat{\rho} \hat{\sigma}_{\mu} \hat{\sigma}_{\nu}\\
    \hat{\rho} \hat{\sigma}_{\mu} \hat{\sigma}_{\nu} & \hat{\sigma}_{\nu}^2
    \end{bmatrix}
    \right).$$
    Compared with the previous prior specification with independent
    sensitivity and specificity, the correlation coefficient
    $\hat{\rho}$ is additionally considered here. It is also estimated
    from the GLMM in EquationÂ (\@ref(eq:glmm)).
-   Random-correlation corrected OR: in addition to the above bivariate
    joint prior for the non-differential sensitivity and specificity, we
    can also consider modeling the uncertainties in the estimated
    correlation coefficient. We consider applying Fisher's
    $z$-transformation to the correlation coefficient in the GLMM.
    Specifically, instead of directly estimating the correlation
    coefficient $\rho$ in EquationÂ (\@ref(eq:glmm)), we reparameterize
    $\rho = \frac{\exp (2z) - 1}{\exp (2z) + 1}$ and obtain the point
    estimate of $z$ from the GLMM and its standard error, denoted by
    $\hat{z}$ and $s_z$, respectively. These estimates can be
    subsequently used as the priors for the sensitivity and specificity
    in the case--control study:
    $$\begin{aligned}
    \begin{split}
    \begin{bmatrix}
    \text{logit}\left(\frac{Se - Se^L}{Se^U - Se^L}\right) \\
    \text{logit}\left(\frac{Sp - Sp^L}{Sp^U - Sp^L}\right)
    \end{bmatrix}
    & \sim
    N \left(
    \begin{bmatrix}
    \hat{u}\\
    \hat{v}
    \end{bmatrix}
    ,
    \begin{bmatrix}
    \hat{\sigma}_{\mu}^2 & \rho \hat{\sigma}_{\mu} \hat{\sigma}_{\nu}\\
    \rho \hat{\sigma}_{\mu} \hat{\sigma}_{\nu} & \hat{\sigma}_{\nu}^2
    \end{bmatrix}
    \right);\\
    \rho & = \frac{\exp (2z) - 1}{\exp (2z) + 1};\\
    z & \sim N(\hat{z}, s_z^2).
    \end{split}
    \end{aligned}$$
-   Differential corrected OR: finally, we consider the differential
    misclassification of the exposure status, i.e., $Se_0 \neq Se_1$ and
    $Sp_0 \neq Sp_1$. All above choices of priors can be similarly
    applied to the four-variate set {$Se_0$, $Sp_0$, $Se_1$, $Sp_1$}.
    For simplicity, we consider a joint prior similar to that in (iv).
    However, the prior applies to cases and controls separately, and it
    does not account for the uncertainties in the correlation
    coefficient as in (v). That is,
    $$\begin{bmatrix}
    \text{logit}\left(\frac{Se_k - Se^L}{Se^U - Se^L}\right) \\
    \text{logit}\left(\frac{Sp_k - Sp^L}{Sp^U - Sp^L}\right)
    \end{bmatrix}
    \sim
    N \left(
    \begin{bmatrix}
    \hat{u}\\
    \hat{v}
    \end{bmatrix}
    ,
    \begin{bmatrix}
    \hat{\sigma}_{\mu}^2 & \hat{\rho} \hat{\sigma}_{\mu} \hat{\sigma}_{\nu}\\
    \hat{\rho} \hat{\sigma}_{\mu} \hat{\sigma}_{\nu} & \hat{\sigma}_{\nu}^2
    \end{bmatrix}
    \right), \quad k = 0, 1.$$

Because of the complexity of the Bayesian model in
EquationÂ (\@ref(eq:bayes)) with the above various choices of priors for
the sensitivity and specificity, we will use Markov chain Monte Carlo
(MCMC) sampling to produce the posterior distribution and thus estimate
the misclassification-bias-corrected odds ratio in the case--control
study and its credible interval.

# Implementation in R {#sec:Implementation}

The aforementioned methods can be implemented in the [R]{.sans-serif}
package *BayesSenMC*. The function `nlmeNDiff` fits a non-differential
GLMM and returns a [*lme4*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=lme4)
[@lme4] object, for which commands such as `summary` can be used to
extract useful statistics from the model; see
`methods(class = "merMod")` for more details. Users can also call the
`paramEst` function to get a list of specific parameter estimates of the
fit that can be directly inputted into the model functions of
*BayesSenMC* for Bayesian inferences. In addition, the link function
used in `nlmeNDiff` can be modified by specifying `lower` and `upper`,
which then changes the lower and upper bounds of $Se_k$ and $Sp_k$
($k = 1$ for cases and $0$ for controls).

The package *BayesSenMC* includes six model functions and one graphing
function called `plotOR`. The model functions return an S4 object of
type `stanfit`, an instance of
[*rstan*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=rstan) [@rstan], which is
an interface of [Stan]{.sans-serif} [@Stan] in R. Users can call methods
such as `print` or `extract` to get detailed information about the
posterior samples. The MCMC procedures are implemented with a default of
two chains, each with 1000 iterations of burn-in period and 2000
iterations to estimate the posterior parameters. They are fit using
`stan`, and the default Monte Carlo algorithm is the No-U-Turn sampler,
a variant of Hamiltonian Monte Carlo [@Hoffman2014; @Betancourt2017].
Any additional arguments to the model function call will be passed into
`stan`. The returned object can then be inputted into `plotOR` to
visualize the posterior distribution of the adjusted odds ratio, as well
as the probability density lines of odds ratio in the cases of no
misclassification and constant Se/Sp as comparisons to the posterior
distribution. It takes optional argument passed into `geom_histogram`,
and returns a [*ggplot2*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=ggplot2)
[@ggplot2] object that can be further customized.

The latest version of *BayesSenMC* is available from CRAN. The package
can be directly installed via the [R]{.sans-serif} prompt:

# Example in R {#sec:Example}

In this section, we use the data in Table [1](#table:RA) as well as
TableÂ [2](#table:meta) of meta-analysis data on the diagnosis accuracy
of bipolar disorder to demonstrate the capabilities of *BayesSenMC*. The
analyses are conducted using [R]{.sans-serif} version 4.1.0
(2021-05-18).

We first fit the meta-analysis data using the GLMM procedure implemented
in our package, assuming non-differential misclassification. Given the
range of Se and Sp of the bipolar disorder meta-analysis data, we must
only assume $Se^L = Sp^L = 0$ and $Se^U = Sp^U = 1$ for the GLMM to
compute real-value results. However, with more information about the
type of diagnoses in @Farhi2016, one can find more informative
constraints on Se and Sp to fit a more precise model.

``` r
R> data(bd_meta)
R> my.mod <- nlmeNDiff(bd_meta, lower = 0)
R> my.mod
```

```

The indicator variable `Se` has a value of 1 for Se estimates and 0 for
Sp estimates. The random effects are grouped within each study, numbered
after `sid`.

The fit reports the Akaike information criterion (AIC), which can be
used to compare across models. The logit means of Se and Sp are given by
the fixed effects, 1.069 and 1.126, which translate to a sensitivity of
0.744 and a specificity of 0.755. The values, larger than 0.5, suggest
that overall, the diagnostic accuracy for bipolar disorder given our
meta-data is better than random, albeit nowhere near perfect. The
standard deviations of logit Se and Sp are given by the random effects,
as well as the correlation. All of the mentioned parameter estimates can
be returned in a list by calling `paramEst`.

We then plug the parameter estimates to get the posterior distributions
for the corrected odds ratio given different priors of Se and Sp. We run
all 6 different models with the case--control study observations in
@Farhi2016, shown in TableÂ [1](#table:RA). The model specifications are
shown in the previous subsection.

Each model above is implemented with 3 Markov chains, and each chain
consists of 5000 burn-in samples and 10,000 iterations to estimate the
parameters (FigureÂ [1](#fig:trace)). The posterior mean, median and 95%
confidence limits of the adjusted odds ratio are as below: 1.35 (1.34,
1.01, 1.74), 5.63 (0.85, 0.02, 36.10), 8.61 (1.93, 0.03, 62.27), 9.33
(1.95, 0.03, 62.62), 9.05 (2.00, 0.03, 64.33), 5.23 (0.82, 0.02, 32.64).
To obtain and analyze the model output, one can simply call the model
variable (e.g., `m.1`). The summary displays the parameters for the
model as well as the mean and confidence limits of the adjusted odds
ratio (i.e., `ORadj`). One can also specify `traceplot = TRUE` to
display a plot of sampled corrected log odds ratio values over
iterations, such as in the above `diffOR` method call.

The above example demonstrates the significance of sensitivity and
specificity in a case--control study. We can examine that by the ratio
of upper to lower 95% posterior interval: 1.74/1.01 = 1.72, 36.10/0.02 =
1805, 62.27/0.03 = 2075.67, 62.62/0.03 = 2087.33, 64.33/0.03 = 2144.33,
and 32.64/0.02 = 1632. The greatest jump happens when we assume
misclassification in the case--control study, and it only differs
slightly with more uncertainties in the model. The increase is
especially significant in @Farhi2016 because the estimated mean Se and
Sp are around only 0.75, as seen from the GLMM. In the future, we will
consider adding other specifications of priors for sensitivity and
specificity to our package, such as beta priors.

``` r
R> library("ggplot2")
R> g1 <- plotOR(m.1, a = 66, N1 = 11782, c = 243, N0 = 57973, se = 0.744,
+      sp = 0.755, x.max = 3, y.max = 5, binwidth = 0.1) + ggtitle("(i)")

We also implement a graphing function, `plotOR`, which takes the input
of a model built with one of the above methods, the observations of the
same case--control study, and the estimated Se and Sp from the GLMM. The
method visualizes the posterior distribution of that model and plots the
probability density line of the adjusted odds ratio given no
misclassification (crude OR) and constant misclassification as specified
by `Se` and `Sp` (corrected OR). This makes it easy for users to compare
the current posterior distribution (especially for models with more
uncertainty) with more certain models to visualize the effect of
misclassification in a case--control study. In addition, the lines serve
as references when comparing across models. The plots and relevant codes
are shown in FigureÂ [2](#fig:visual). Users can also choose to extract
the data from the *rstan* objects by calling functions such as
`extract`, `as.data.frame`, etc.

According to the plot, we observe a drastic change to the posterior
distribution after taking non-perfect Se and Sp into account. Then, we
observe slightly more uniform distributions as there is more uncertainty
in the model. What is also worth noting is that in part (ii) of the
plot, the posterior density and MCMC sampling do not share the same
shape, even though both assume non-perfect constant Se and Sp. This may
be a result of low Se and Sp values, which may affect the log-normality
assumption in the MCMC posterior samples.

We now show the effects of the number of iterations and chains on the
computing speed of our models. All models have been pre-compiled, which
reduces the computing time significantly. For example, `randCorrOR`,
which is presumably one of the most complex and time-consuming models to
compute, takes about 1.32 seconds to run 3 chains with 5000 warm-up
periods and 10,000 iterations each. In comparison, it takes about 0.20
seconds to compute 2 chains with 1000 warm-up periods and 2000
iterations each. In practice, a larger number of MCMC chains and
iterations leads to more stable and accurate results and thus is
recommended. Furthermore, we find that models, such as provided by
`randCorrOR`, have smaller target posterior distribution regions in a
Markov chain, thus rendering it easy for the algorithm to miss the true
distribution and result in "divergent transitions," which may return
biased estimates. Increasing the value of `adapt_delta` parameter up to
1 in the `control` argument of the methods can effectively make *rstan*
take smaller steps to approach the target.

# Conclusion {#sec:Conclusion}

In this article, we introduce and implement the methods for making
posterior inferences on the corrected odds ratio by modeling the
uncertainty on both differential and non-differential misclassification
through appropriate prior distributions. The specific implementation is
publicly available using the [R]{.sans-serif} package *BayesSenMC*. The
process can be divided into two parts. First, one can use the GLMM model
with a binomial-logit link to estimate prior information on Se and Sp
via a meta-analysis on the misclassification of exposure status. Second,
the estimates can be plugged into the modeling functions to provide
inferences for the odds ratio. The models can also be visualized
side-by-side for better comparisons. The validity of the analyses
depends highly on the relevance of meta-analysis, in which irrelevant
studies may skew the prior estimates of Se and Sp significantly, and
consequentially, the corrected odds ratio. In addition, our models
assume normal and independent priors on true exposure probabilities,
which may be limited in some cases [@Chu2006].
