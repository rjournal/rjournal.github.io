title: 'BayesSenMC: an R package for Bayesian Sensitivity Analysis of Misclassification'
abstract: In case–control studies, the odds ratio is commonly used to summarize the
  association be tween a binary exposure and a dichotomous outcome. However, exposure
  misclassification frequently appears in case–control studies due to inaccurate data
  reporting, which can produce bias in measures of association. In this article, we
  implement a Bayesian sensitivity analysis of misclassification to provide a full
  posterior inference on the corrected odds ratio under both non-differential and
  differen tial misclassification. We present an R (R Core Team, 2018) package BayesSenMC,
  which provides user-friendly functions for its implementation. The usage is illustrated
  by a real data analysis on the association between bipolar disorder and rheumatoid
  arthritis.
