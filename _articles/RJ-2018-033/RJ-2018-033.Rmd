title: 'RealVAMS: An R Package for Fitting a Multivariate Value-added Model (VAM)'
abstract: We present RealVAMS, an R package for fitting a generalized linear mixed
  model to multimembership data with partially crossed and partially nested random
  effects. RealVAMS utilizes a multivariate generalized linear mixed model with pseudo-likelihood
  approximation for fitting normally distributed continuous response(s) jointly with
  a binary outcome. In an educational context, the model is referred to as a multidimensional
  value-added model, which extends previous theory to estimate the relationships between
  potential teacher contributions toward different student outcomes and to allow the
  consideration of a binary, real-world outcome such as graduation. The simultaneous
  joint modeling of continuous and binary outcomes was not available prior to RealVAMS
  due to computational difficulties. In this paper, we discuss the multidimensional
  model, describe RealVAMS, and demonstrate the use of this package and its modeling
  options with an educational data set.
