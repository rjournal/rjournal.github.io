title: RcmdrPlugin.temis, a Graphical Integrated Text Mining Solution in R
abstract: We present the package *RcmdrPlugin.temis*, a graphical user interface for
  user-friendly text mining in R. Built as a plug-in to the R Commander provided by
  the *Rcmdr* package, it brings together several existing packages and provides new
  features streamlining the process of importing, managing and analyzing a corpus,
  in addition to saving results and plots to a report file. Beyond common file formats,
  automated import of corpora from the Dow Jones Factiva content provider and Twitter
  is supported. Featured analyses include vocabulary and dissimilarity tables, terms
  frequencies, terms specific of levels of a variable, term co-occurrences, time series,
  correspondence analysis and hierarchical clustering.

# Introduction

Text mining applications have become quite popular in the social
sciences -- in particular in sociology and political science -- fostered
by the availability of integrated graphical user interfaces (GUIs) that
render typical analyses possible at a reasonably low learning cost. R
has been technically well positioned in the area of text mining for
several years, thanks to the
[*tm*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=tm) package
[@tm:Feinerer+Hornik+Meyer:2008; @tm:Feinerer+Hornik:2013] and to its
rich ecosystem of packages dedicated to advanced text mining
operations[^1], but also to general purpose packages whose power can be
leveraged for this particular application. Yet, the power and the
flexibility of this environment present the downside that non-technical
users can feel lost, especially when they are used to GUIs that do not
provide them -- to say the least -- with so many possibilities.

In this article, we present
[*RcmdrPlugin.temis*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=RcmdrPlugin.temis)
("R.TeMiS", for R Text Mining Solution, in short) version 0.6.1
[@RcmdrPlugin.temis:Bouchet-Valat+Bastin:2013], a new package that
intends to fill this gap by providing users with a GUI, in the form of a
menu augmenting the R Commander [provided by the
[*Rcmdr*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=Rcmdr) package, *cf.*
@Rcmdr:Fox:2005]. We hope to provide an integrated and easy to use
graphical solution that does not constrain the user into a specific path
of analysis, as an alternative to proprietary software packages that
currently dominate the market, often with a closed-source conception of
what users should (and can) do, and what they should not.

Following the spirit of free software and scientific research, we intend
to empower users and not lock them in a jointly technical and
theoretical, rigorously defined paradigm. Though, even if we are open to
different approaches of text mining, the current features that we
demonstrate below are largely based on a long-established tradition of
exploratory data analysis; the interested reader will find a detailed
description of these techniques in e.g. @etd:Lebart+Salem+Berry:1998.

# Design choices

The fundamental choice behind the design of *RcmdrPlugin.temis* is that
it is fully integrated into -- and actually written in -- R. Following
the general principle adopted by the R Commander, every action initiated
by the user via the GUI generates R code which is shown to the user
while it is executed (Figure [1](#figure:main)), and which can be saved
and run again later. This makes it possible to manually edit the code,
be it to customize a function call or to reuse objects to extend the
analysis without starting from scratch; this also ensures the
reproducibility of the results, a major issue in scientific research.

Thus, *RcmdrPlugin.temis* differs from other text mining GUIs, which do
not generate source code, and provide little space for extending the set
of possible analyses. In particular, two free software text mining tools
offer a relatively similar set of features: Iramuteq
[@Iramuteq:Ratinaud:2013] and TXM [@TXM:Heiden:2010][^2]. These two
projects use R as a back end for some analyses, but are written as
standalone applications completely separated from the R session; this
means that the power of R as a general purpose statistical environment
is not directly accessible to the user.

The decision of writing our package as an R Commander plug-in also
presents several other advantages. First, all the features offered by
*Rcmdr* are still available to the user: in particular, menus allowing
to import and recode data and to export plots can be very useful for
text mining work. Second, *Rcmdr* runs without too much tweaking on all
platforms, since the toolkit it relies on, Tcl/Tk, is built-in standard
in R via the *tcltk* package (see the next section for instructions on
how to install *RcmdrPlugin.temis*). The downside of this choice is of
course that the resulting interface is not fully geared towards text
mining, contrary to what a dedicated application would have made
possible.

Other general purpose R GUIs such as RKWard
[@RKWard:Rodiger+Friedrichsmeier+Kapat+Michalke:2012] and Deducer
[@Deducer:Fellows:2012] could have been used instead of the R Commander.
But at the time the project was started, no Mac OS X port of the former
existed, and the latter was not even released yet [for a discussion of
the different R GUIs see @GUIs:Valero-Mora+Ledesma:2012 and the
individual articles of that special issue]. The choice of the hosting
GUI for a text mining plug-in is in the end closely tied to the question
of the best R GUI: our choice has been to rely on the most mature
one[^3].

Under the hood, *RcmdrPlugin.temis* puts together state-of-the-art R
packages covering various types of applications and makes them easily
accessible to perform text mining tasks. At the core of the text mining
operation is the *tm* package, which provides the framework to import
corpora from various sources, process texts and extract their vocabulary
in the form of a document-term matrix. All other packages on which
*RcmdrPlugin.temis* depends are plugged into this framework to provide
specific features. We illustrate them below.

![Figure 1: Main R Commander window showing text mining menu and top of
the terms dictionary sorted by number of
occurrences.](main.png){#figure:main width="80.0%" alt="graphic without alt text"}

# Installing and launching the package

Like any CRAN package, *RcmdrPlugin.temis* and its mandatory
dependencies can be installed using the R command

``` r
install.packages("RcmdrPlugin.temis")
```

or from graphical menus provided by the R GUI you are using.

In case of problems, more details concerning that platform, as well as
Windows and Linux, can be found on the R Commander web page:
<http://socserv.mcmaster.ca/jfox/Misc/Rcmdr/installation-notes.html>.

Once installed, the package can be be loaded with the command:

``` r
library("RcmdrPlugin.temis")
```

(or, again, using menus).

# Importing and managing corpora

The first task that *RcmdrPlugin.temis* intends to allow is the seamless
importation of a corpus -- an often neglected task which can prove quite
time-consuming in typical research work. The program will ask to
automatically install the packages needed to import corpora from the
chosen source at the first attempt to do so[^4]: this applies to all
sources except plain text and comma/tab-separated values (CSV/TSV)
files. Four types of sources are currently supported:

-   A series of plain text files (typically .txt) contained in a
    directory.

-   A spreadsheet-like file (.csv, .ods, .xls, ...) with one line per
    document (answers to an open-ended question, typically). The first
    column must contain the text to analyze; the remaining columns can
    provide information about the document and are automatically
    imported as variables. Open Document Spreadsheet files (.ods) are
    loaded using the
    [*ROpenOffice*](http://www.omegahat.org/ROpenOffice/) package
    [@ROpenOffice:TempleLang:2011][^5], and Microsoft Excel files (.xls,
    .xlsx) are imported using the
    [*RODBC*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=RODBC) package
    [@RODBC:Ripley+Lapsley:2012][^6].

-   One or several .xml or .html files exported from the Dow Jones
    Factiva content provider, using the dedicated
    [*tm.plugin.factiva*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=tm.plugin.factiva)
    package [@tm.plugin.factiva:Bouchet-Valat:2013]; using this portal,
    often available via academic subscriptions, streamlines the process
    of creating a corpus by allowing the mass importation of press
    articles from many newspapers, together with meta-data information
    like origin, date, author, topics and geographic coverage.

-   A Twitter search [thanks to the
    [*twitteR*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=twitteR) package,
    *cf.* @twitteR:Gentry:2013] on hash tags, authors or full text, or
    more complex criteria supported by the Twitter API.

By default, plain text and CSV/TSV files are assumed to use the native
system encoding: this is usually UTF-8 (Unicode) on Mac OS X and Linux,
and varies depending on the locale on Windows. An indication that this
default choice is not appropriate is the presence of incorrect
accentuated characters in the corpus, but it may also happen that the
import fails, or does not detect documents and variables. In that case,
you will need to specify the encoding of the file by choosing it in the
drop-down list provided by the import dialog
(Figure [2](#figure:import)). If such problems persist, opening the
relevant files in a text editor or spreadsheet application and saving
them in a known encoding is a reliable solution[^7].

The import dialog also offers text processing options. First, texts can
be split into smaller chunks defined as a number of adjacent paragraphs,
which is most useful for relatively long texts, for example press
articles imported from a Factiva source; in that case, each chunk will
be considered as a document in subsequent analyses, and a meta-data
variable will identify the original text from which the chunk
originates. Second, texts can be processed to make them more suitable
for computer analysis: conversion to lower case, punctuation removal,
stopwords removal, and finally stemming can be carried out. Stopwords
removal is disabled by default, since we consider that it should only be
performed based on a conscious decision made by the researcher: in many
cases, at least some stopwords are of interest for the analysis.

Stemming is performed using the
[*SnowballC*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=SnowballC) package
[@SnowballC:Bouchet-Valat:2013], which relies on the C libstemmer
library provided by the Snowball project initiated by Martin Porter[^8].
This processing option is most interesting for short texts because small
grammatical variations can dramatically reduce the number of (exact)
co-occurrences between two texts, thus hindering later analyses of
between-document relationships. After this step, the document-term
matrix is created, which will be the basis for most later work; a
summary of the matrix is printed on the screen.

![Figure 2: The import dialog with the settings used in the presented
example.](import.png){#figure:import width="50.0%" alt="graphic without alt text"}

Once the corpus has been imported, additional meta-data variables can be
loaded from the active data set, be it imported from an external file or
filled from R itself, using the
`Manage corpus `$\to$` Set corpus variables` menu item. The variables
will then be made available for all analyses we present below.

The dictionary of terms that are present as columns of the document-term
matrix and will be the basis of analyses can be altered in two ways:

-   If specific terms are known (or found out later) to disturb the
    analyses -- as commonly happens with meta-vocabulary like "read" and
    "page" in press articles -- they can be excluded.

-   If only some terms known in advance are of interest, the matrix can
    be restricted to them.

Finally, documents can be managed in the same way, by only keeping those
containing (or *not* containing) some terms, or those corresponding to a
given level of a variable. As said earlier, documents can refer to text
chunks if this option was checked during the import, in which case this
feature can be used to create a thematic corpus from large and
heterogeneous original texts, thanks to a simple selection of chunks
according to a set of terms, or to hierarchical clustering. In any case,
the original corpus can be saved and restored at will.

For demonstration purposes, we use in the rest of this presentation a
small corpus of 19 documents dealing with crude oil which appeared in
the Reuters newswire in 1987, and is included in the classic Reuters
21578 data set (already used in *tm* examples). This small set of
articles provides a good illustration of the typical analysis of a press
corpus[^9]. The corpus is shipped with the *tm.plugin.factiva* package
in the Factiva XML format with its meta-data; the location of this file
on your system can be found using the following command provided you
have installed the package:

``` r
system.file("texts", "reut21578-factiva.xml", package = "tm.plugin.factiva")
```

You can also download it directly from:
<http://r-temis.r-forge.r-project.org/texts/reuters21578-factiva.xml>.

To import the file as a corpus, use the
`Text mining `$\to$` Import corpus...` menu, select
`Factiva XML or HTML file(s)` for source, choose "English (en)" as the
language of the corpus, and enable stopwords removal by checking the
corresponding box; we leave other options to their default values
(Figure [2](#figure:import)). Then click `OK`: dialogs will allow you to
select the file (`reut21578-factiva.xml`) and the variables to retain
(we will use "Date", but you may also retain other variables), and the
import phase will be run. You can then check the raw contents
(*i.e.* not affected by processing operations) of the corpus using the
`Show current corpus` menu item, and see the corpus' words, their
stemmed form and their number of occurrences using the
`Terms dictionary `$\to$` Sorted by number of occurrences` menu
(Figure [1](#figure:main)).

# Elementary statistics

Because *RcmdrPlugin.temis* aims at providing users with a complete text
mining solution, it provides dialog boxes to compute simple statistics
not directly related to lexical analysis, but that we consider useful to
explore the composition of a corpus. The `Distribution of documents`
sub-menu allows creating one- and two-way tables from meta-data
variables, and optionally plots the result. This sub-menu also makes it
possible to plot time series representing the number of documents over
time, using a single curve, or one curve for each level of a variable;
as an option, the rolling mean can be computed over a configurable time
window. This feature is based on packages
[*zoo*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=zoo)
[@zoo:Zeileis+Grothendieck:2005] for computations and
[*lattice*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=lattice)
[@lattice:Sarkar:2008] for plotting, which means the generated code can
easily be extended by users for custom representations if needed. It is
especially useful for corpora imported directly from Factiva or Twitter,
which contain date and time information that can prove of high value for
the study of the timing of media cycles.

The `Descriptive analysis of vocabulary` menu introduces us to tasks
more oriented towards text analysis *per se*. As a first preview of our
corpus, we can print the most frequent terms and their number of
occurrences, for the whole corpus as well as for each level of a
variable.

A slightly more sophisticated information is provided by the
`Terms specific of levels...` dialog: this feature reports terms whose
observed frequency in each level is either too high or too low compared
to what would be expected given the documents' lengths and the global
distribution of terms in the corpus. p-values based on an hypergeometric
distribution give the probability of observing such an extreme number of
occurrences in the level under the independence hypothesis; the sign of
t-values can be used to identify positive (printed first) and negative
(printed last) associations.

  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  : Table 1: Terms specific of the first day with more than 5
  occurrences in the corpus.
:::

The printed output (*cf.* Table [1](#table:specificterms)) also provides
several descriptive statistics: the share of all occurrences of all
terms in the level that is accounted for by the corresponding term
("% Term/Level"), the share of the occurrences of the term that happen
in the level rather than elsewhere in the corpus ("% Level/Term"), the
share of the term in all occurrences of all terms in the whole corpus
("Global %"), and finally the absolute number of occurrences of the term
in the level and in the corpus.

In our example, choosing the "Date" variable, we can observe
(Table [1](#table:specificterms), where terms with the lowest p-value
and more than 5 occurrences are retained) that articles deal with oil
markets on the first day, while Middle East countries ("saudi",
"kuwait") are not cited at all, contrary to other days, a difference
from the corpus average which is significant at the 5% confidence level.

Other measures can be computed, both by document and by levels of a
variable: vocabulary summary (number of terms, diversity and
complexity); frequency and specificity of chosen terms; co-occurring
terms (that is, terms that tend to appear in the same documents as
chosen terms); dissimilarity table (Chi-squared distance between row
profiles of the document-term matrix collapsed according to the levels
of a variable).

# Hierarchical clustering and correspondence analysis

The power of R and of its ecosystem is clearly visible when implementing
more sophisticated techniques: from the document-term matrix created
using *tm*, *RcmdrPlugin.temis* easily performs a hierarchical
clustering of the documents using function `hclust()` from the *base*
package, and a correspondence analysis (CA) using the
[*ca*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=ca) package
[@ca:Nenadic+Greenacre:2007]. These two features are often used together
in text mining software, but are relatively hard to run manually for
beginners; the possibility to only plot a subset of points was also
missing from all CA packages available in R, a feature particularly
required for text mining where terms are too many to be all shown at the
same time.

For both techniques, a dialog allows eliminating from the document-term
matrix sparse terms, *i.e.* terms that appear in too few documents. Such
terms are of little use for methods that intend to group a significant
number of documents together based on term co-occurrences, and they can
lead to system memory issues with large corpora. Here we use the value
of 94%, which means that terms present in 6% of documents and less are
not taken into account: this amounts to removing terms present in only
one document, reducing the number of terms from 705 to 239 without much
loss of information (since terms appearing in only one document provide
no information on relations among documents, and can only help singling
out outliers).

Hierarchical clustering can be run from the
`Hierarchical clustering `$\to$` Run clustering...` menu; this command
uses Ward's method based on a Chi-squared distance between
documents[^10].

![Figure 3: Dendrogram of documents resulting from hierarchical
clustering.](dendrogram.png){#figure:dendrogram width="100%" alt="graphic without alt text"}

The resulting dendrogram is automatically plotted
(Figure [3](#figure:dendrogram)), and its inspection prompts us to
choose to create 5 clusters according to a scree test (the reduction in
variance is relatively strong when going from 4 to 5 clusters, and slows
down afterwards). If we change our mind later, the `Create clusters...`
menu command allows choosing another number of clusters without running
the full computations again. As printed in a separate window, the
resulting clusters contain 1, 4, 11, 1 and 2 documents, respectively;
clusters 2 and 3 are more homogeneous (within-cluster variance of 3.8)
than cluster 5, despite being the two largest, with respectively 21% and
58% of all documents versus 11%. Terms and documents specific of each
cluster are also automatically printed. Specific documents are chosen
according to their (as small as possible) Chi-squared distance to the
centroid of the cluster, *i.e.* the mean term distribution of the
cluster.

We will not detail here the interpretation of the clusters. Let us
simply note that if one is interested in reading more associated terms,
the `Create clusters...` dialog will allow raising the total number of
printed terms. Once identified, clusters can be used in all other
analyses offered by *RcmdrPlugin.temis*: a meta-data variable called
"Cluster" is automatically created. As an illustration, the
`Distribution of documents `$\to$` Two-way table of variables...` can
now be used to cross the "Date" variable with the "Cluster" one, and see
that cluster 3 gains momentum in March compared to February.

When dealing with a larger corpus with date or time information, the
`Temporal evolution...` item available from the same sub-menu is of
great interest to help visualize the variations of clusters over time.
Further, the "Cluster" variable can be introduced in a CA as a
supplementary variable, which can help identifying the meaning of
clusters themselves: this is what we will now present.

But first, as the only article in cluster 1 appears to be very different
from the rest of the corpus, we may want to exclude it before running
the CA: indeed, if we retain it, we can notice that this article alone
draws the opposition on several dimensions. We thus use the
`Manage corpus `$\to$` Subset corpus `$\to$` By variable...` menu,
choosing the newly created "Cluster" variable, and selecting only the
levels 2, 3, 4 and 5 (keep the Ctrl key pressed to select several items
in the box using the mouse).

![Figure 4: Information about the CA axes, and most contributive terms
on the negative side of axis 1.](CA-axes.png){#figure:caaxes
width="100%" alt="graphic without alt text"}

The CA can be run from
`Correspondence analysis `$\to$` Run analysis...`: again, we exclude
terms missing from more than 94% of documents. The number of dimensions
to retain only affects the display of axes, and does not change the
results: we can safely keep the default value. After running the CA, a
dialog box opens automatically to show the results. It offers a few
options that apply both to the text window that opens, similar as for
the cluster analysis, and to the plot which is drawn at the same time.
Among the most important options is the option which allows to select
the number of terms and documents shown: as with clustering, only the
most contributive items are shown; one can choose to show items most
contributive to both axes taken together, or only to one of them. Here,
we choose to print terms and documents most contributive to the first
two axes.

The text window (Figure [4](#figure:caaxes)) presents axes one by one,
first their negative, then their positive side, each with most
contributive terms and documents, and finally the situation of
supplementary (passive) variables on the axis. It thus constitutes a
major help to interpreting the plotted plane (Figure [5](#figure:ca)).

By ticking the `Variables` check box in the `Draw labels for:` section,
we can study the position of clusters on the CA plane by plotting them
as supplementary levels: it is possible to select the "Cluster" variable
so that other variables are not drawn (as previously, use the Ctrl key
when clicking to select if you want to select several variables in the
list).

![Figure 5: The first plane of the CA with most contributive terms and
clusters as supplementary levels.](CA.png){#figure:ca width="100%" alt="graphic without alt text"}

# Exporting results

Since *RcmdrPlugin.temis* aims at providing an integrated text mining
solution, we could not leave our users at this stage of the analysis
without providing them with a good way of exporting results. The last
sub-menu is here precisely for that. After any of the operations
described above, it allows copying the last printed table or last drawn
plot to an output file in the HTML format, thanks to the
[*R2HTML*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=R2HTML) package
[@R2HTML:Lecoutre:2003]. With this command, plots are saved to a PNG
file using a reasonably high resolution in the directory containing the
HTML file, and inserted into it. The `Draw plots in black and white`
menu command converts current and future plots to a mode suitable for
printing and publications, using different line types to replace
colors[^11].

From the HTML file that is opened automatically in the default Web
browser, users can copy tables to a word processor without loss of
quality. Users looking for high resolution plots will happily use the
richer exporting features of the R Commander
(`Graphs `$\to$` Save graph to file` menu) or of their standard R GUI,
in particular to export graphs in vector formats like PDF, PostScript or
SVG. Given the low quality of graphics produced by most proprietary text
mining software, we have no doubt that R's qualities in that area will
be appreciated!

# Conclusion

By putting together in a GUI the many existing pieces that already make
possible advanced and flexible text mining analyses with R, we hope to
fill the needs of new users, who are currently locked using proprietary
solutions. We also hope to ease the life of more advanced users who can
find in our package a straightforward way of running common tasks before
adapting or extending the generated code.

Those looking for more detailed information than was exposed in this
introduction about the exact operations run by the GUI are advised to
consult *RcmdrPlugin.temis*'s documentation available under the `Help`
button in all dialog boxes, and to already cited introductions to the
*tm* package, as well as online functions documentation.

*RcmdrPlugin.temis* does not impose on users any canonical model of text
mining, but intends to provide users with all available techniques: we
are open to suggestions and additions of new features that will help
leverage the power of R's ecosystem.

# Acknowledgments

The authors would like to thank the maintainers of the packages used by
this GUI, in particular Ingo Feinerer, John Fox, Kurt Hornik and Duncan
Temple Lang, who have been most helpful by their responses and the fixes
they applied to their code to make it suit our needs when necessary, and
Bénédicte Garnier and Élisabeth Morand (INED) for their useful remarks
and harsh testing.

    <http://CRAN.R-project.org/view=NaturalLanguageProcessing> for a
    list of packages applying to this field.

[^2]: See respectively <http://www.iramuteq.org> and
    <http://textometrie.ens-lyon.fr/?lang=en>. Interestingly, all of the
    three projects are developed by French researchers.

[^3]: The GUI itself represents only a share of the work required to
    create an integrated text mining solution: this means that plug-ins
    for other general purpose GUIs could be written without too much
    effort in the future by adapting *RcmdrPlugin.temis*'s code base.

[^4]: This operation requires a working Internet connection.

[^5]: This package will only be automatically installed by the GUI on
    Linux at the time of writing, since no binary packages are
    available. Users familiar with building R packages from source can
    install the package manually, but this requires tools which are
    typically not installed by most users on Windows and Mac OS X.

[^6]: This package will only be automatically installed by the GUI on
    Windows, since *RODBC* relies on an Excel ODBC driver which is
    installed by default on Windows but not on other platforms. Mac OS X
    users can install such a driver and the package manually. New
    solutions might be investigated in the future.

[^7]: For example, OpenOffice/LibreOffice Writer and Calc applications
    offer this option -- called "charset" -- when "Edit filter options"
    is checked in the save dialog.

[^8]: See <http://snowball.tartarus.org>. At the time of writing,
    supported languages are Danish, Dutch, English, Finnish, French,
    German, Hungarian, Italian, Norwegian, Portuguese, Romanian,
    Russian, Spanish, Swedish and Turkish.

[^9]: Even though most techniques make more sense applied to large
    corpora, this small set of texts is sufficient to illustrate all the
    steps involved in the analysis of a corpus of any size, with the
    advantage of easy reproducibility and low computing requirements.

[^10]: Since this method tends to start with clusters identifying
    outliers, which are often of little interest, an alternative
    solution is also provided: instead of running the clustering
    procedure on the document-term matrix itself, one can choose to base
    the analysis on an approximation of the matrix obtained using a
    given number of axes of the CA (once it has been computed using the
    corresponding menu). This procedure reduces the noise in the data
    and allows for a strong relationship between clusters and CA axes.
    We do not retain this solution here.

[^11]: CA plots, which are not drawn using *lattice*, do not benefit
    from this feature.
