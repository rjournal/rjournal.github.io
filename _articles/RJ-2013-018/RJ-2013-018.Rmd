title: RcmdrPlugin.temis, a Graphical Integrated Text Mining Solution in R
abstract: We present the package RcmdrPlugin.temis, a graphical user interface for
  user-friendly text mining in R. Built as a plug-in to the R Commander provided by
  the Rcmdr package, it brings together several existing packages and provides new
  features streamlining the process of importing, managing and analyzing a corpus,
  in addition to saving results and plots to a report file. Beyond common file formats,
  automated import of corpora from the Dow Jones Factiva content provider and Twitter
  is supported. Featured analyses include vocabulary and dissimilarity tables, terms
  frequencies, terms specific of levels of a variable, term co-occurrences, time series,
  correspondence analysis and hierarchical clustering.
