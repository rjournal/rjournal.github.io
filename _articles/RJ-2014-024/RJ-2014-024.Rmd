title: Flexible R Functions for Processing Accelerometer Data, with Emphasis on NHANES
  2003-2006
abstract: Accelerometers are a valuable tool for measuring physical activity (PA)
  in epidemiological studies. However, considerable processing is needed to convert
  time-series accelerometer data into meaningful variables for statistical analysis.
  This article describes two recently developed R packages for processing accelerometer
  data. The package accelerometry contains functions for performing various data processing
  procedures, such as identifying periods of non-wear time and bouts of activity.
  The functions are flexible, computationally efficient, and compatible with uniaxial
  or triaxial data. The package nhanesaccel is specifically for processing data from
  the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), years 2003â€“2006.
  Its primary function generates measures of PA volume, intensity, frequency, and
  patterns according to user-specified data processing methods. This function can
  process the NHANES 2003-2006 dataset in under one minute, which is a drastic improve
  ment over existing software. This article highlights important features of packages
  accelerometry and nhanesaccel and demonstrates typical usage for PA researchers.
