title: 'penPHcure: Variable Selection in Proportional Hazards Cure Model with Time-Varying
  Covariates'
abstract: ' We describe the [penPHcure](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=penPHcure)
  R package, which implements the semiparametric proportional-hazards (PH) cure model
  of @Sy_Taylor_2000 extended to time-varying covariates and the variable selection
  technique based on its SCAD-penalized likelihood proposed by @Beretta_Heuchenne_2019.
  In survival analysis, cure models are a useful tool when a fraction of the population
  is likely to be immune from the event of interest. They can separate the effects
  of certain factors on the probability of being susceptible and on the time until
  the occurrence of the event. Moreover, the penPHcure package allows the user to
  simulate data from a PH cure model, where the event-times are generated on a continuous
  scale from a piecewise exponential distribution conditional on time-varying covariates,
  with a method similar to @Hendry_2014. We present the results of a simulation study
  to assess the finite sample performance of the methodology and illustrate the functionalities
  of the penPHcure package using criminal recidivism data. '
