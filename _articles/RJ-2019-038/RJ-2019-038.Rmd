title: 'SemiCompRisks: An R Package for the Analysis of Independent and Cluster-correlated
  Semi-competing Risks Data'
abstract: 'Semi-competing risks refer to the setting where primary scientific interest
  lies in estimation and inference with respect to a non-terminal event, the occurrence
  of which is subject to a terminal event. In this paper, we present the R package
  SemiCompRisks that provides functions to perform the analysis of independent/clustered
  semi-competing risks data under the illness-death multi-state model. The package
  allows the user to choose the specification for model components from a range of
  options giving users substantial flexibility, including: accelerated failure time
  or proportional hazards regression models; parametric or non-parametric specifications
  for baseline survival functions; parametric or non-parametric specifications for
  random effects distributions when the data are cluster correlated; and, a Markov
  or semi-Markov specification for terminal event following non-terminal event. While
  estimation is mainly performed within the Bayesian paradigm, the package also provides
  the maximum likelihood estimation for select parametric models. The package also
  includes functions for univariate survival analysis as complementary analysis tools.'
