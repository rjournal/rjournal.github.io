title: The Landscape of R Packages for Automated Exploratory Data Analysis
abstract: |
  The increasing availability of large but noisy data sets with a large
  number of heterogeneous variables leads to the increasing interest in
  the automation of common tasks for data analysis. The most
  time-consuming part of this process is the Exploratory Data Analysis,
  crucial for better domain understanding, data cleaning, data
  validation, and feature engineering.\
  There is a growing number of libraries that attempt to automate some
  of the typical Exploratory Data Analysis tasks to make the search for
  new insights easier and faster. In this paper, we present a systematic
  review of existing tools for Automated Exploratory Data Analysis
  (autoEDA). We explore the features of fifteen popular R packages to
  identify the parts of analysis that can be effectively automated with
  the current tools and to point out new directions for further autoEDA
  development.

# Introduction

With the advent of tools for automated model training (autoML), building
predictive models is becoming easier, more accessible and faster than
ever. Tools for R such as mlrMBO [@mlrMBO], parsnip [@parsnip]; tools
for python such as TPOT [@tpot], auto-sklearn [@autosklearn], autoKeras
[@autokeras] or tools for other languages such as H2O Driverless AI
[@h2o; @h2obook] and autoWeka [@autoweka] supports fully- or
semi-automated feature engineering and selection, model tuning and
training of predictive models.

Yet, model building is always preceded by a phase of understanding the
problem, understanding of a domain and exploration of a data set.
Usually, in the process of the data analysis much more time is spent on
data preparation and exploration than on model tuning. This is why the
current bottleneck in data analysis is in the exploratory data analysis
(EDA) phase. Recently, a number of tools were developed to automate or
speed up the part of the summarizing data and discovering patterns.
Since the process of building predictive models automatically is
referred to as autoML, we will dub the automation of data exploration
autoEDA. The surge in interest in autoEDA tools[^1] is evident in the
Figure [1](#fig:downloads). Table [1](#table:popularity) describes the
popularity of autoEDA tools measured as the number of downloads from
CRAN and usage statistics from Github[^2].

![Figure 1: Trends in number of downloads of autoEDA packages available
on CRAN since the first release. Data was gathered on 12.07.2019 with
the help of the
[*cranlogs*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=cranlogs) package
[@cranlogs].](autoEDA_downloads.png){#fig:downloads width="100%"
alt="graphic without alt text"}

There is an abundance of R libraries that provide functions for both
graphical and descriptive data exploration. Here, we restrict our
attention to packages that aim to automatize or significantly speed up
the process of exploratory data analysis for tabular data. Such tools
usually work with full data frames, which are processed in an automatic
or semi-automatic manner, for example by guessing data types, and return
summary tables, groups of plots or full reports. Currently, there is no
CRAN Task View dedicated to packages for automated Exploratory Data
Analysis and neither was there any repository that would catalogue
them[^3]. Here, we make a first attempt to comprehensively describe R
tools for autoEDA. We chose two types of packages. The first group
explicitly aims to automate EDA, as stated in the description of the
package. These includes packages for *fast*, *easy*, *interactive* or
*automated* data exploration. The second group contains packages that
create data summaries. These packages were included, as long as they
address at least two analysis goals listed in Table [2](#tab:tasks). We
do not describe in detail packages that are either restricted to one
area of application (for example *RBioPlot* [@rbioplot] package
dedicated to biomolecular data or *intsvy* [@intsvy] package focused on
international large-scale assessments), designed for one specific task
(for example creating tables), or in an early development phase. Some of
the more task-specific packages are briefly discussed in Section
[2.16](#other). Some packages, such as
[*radiant*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=radiant) [@radiant] cover
the full analysis pipeline and, as such, are too general for our
purposes, even though they include an EDA module.

This paper has two main goals. First is to characterize existing R
packages for automated Exploratory Data Analysis and compare their
ranges of capabilities. To our best knowledge, this is first such a
review. Previously, a smaller comparison of seven packages was done in
[@smartedapaper]. Second is to identify areas, where automated data
exploration could be improved. In particular, we are interested in
gauging the potential of AI-assisted EDA tools.

The first goal is addressed in Sections [2](#chapter:packages) *R
packages for automated EDA* and [3](#chapter:feature) *Feature
comparison* where we first briefly describe each package and the
compare, how are different EDA tasks are tackled by these packages.
Then, in Section [4](#chapter:summary) *Summary*, we compile a list of
strong and weak points of the automated EDA software and detail some
open problems.

## The tasks of Exploratory Data Analysis {#chapter:tasks}

Exploratory Data Analysis is listed as an important step in most
methodologies for data analysis [@MDP; @r4datascience]. One of the most
popular methodologies, the CRISP-DM [@crispdm], lists the following
phases of a data mining project:

1.  Business understanding.

2.  Data understanding.

3.  Data preparation.

4.  Modeling.

5.  Evaluation.

6.  Deployment.

Automated EDA tools aim to make the Data understanding phase as fast and
as easy as possible. This part of a project can be further divided into
smaller tasks. These include a description of a dataset, data
exploration, and data quality verification. All these tasks can be
achieved both by providing descriptive statistics and numerical
summaries and by visual means. AutoEDA packages provide functions to
deal with these challenges. Some of them are also concerned with simple
variable transformations and data cleaning. Both these tasks belong in
the Data preparation phase, which precedes and supports the model
building phase. Let us notice that business understanding is affected by
data understanding, which makes this part of the analysis especially
important.

Goals of autoEDA tools are summarised in Table [2](#tab:tasks). The
*Phase* and *Tasks* columns are taken from the CRISP-DM standard, while
*Type* and *Examples* columns provide examples based on current
functionalities of autoEDA packages.

Each task should be summarised in a report, which makes reporting
another relevant problem of autoEDA. Uni- and bivariate data exploration
is a part of the analysis that is most thoroughly covered by the
existing autoEDA tools. The form of univariate summaries depends on the
variable type. For numerical variables, most packages provide
descriptive statistics such as centrality and dispersion measures. For
categorical data, unique levels and associated counts are reported.
Bivariate relationships descriptions display either dependency between
one variable of interest and all other variables, which includes
contingency tables, scatter plots, survival curves, plots of
distribution by values of a variable (histograms, bar plots, box plots),
or between all pairs of variables (correlation matrices and plots), or
chosen pairs of variables.

# R packages for automated EDA {#chapter:packages}

In this section, fifteen R libraries are shortly summarised. One of them
is only available on GitHub (*autoEDA*), all others are available at
CRAN. For each library, we include example outputs. The exact versions
of packages that were used to create them can be found in the reference
section. All examples are based on a subset of `typical_data`[^4]
dataset from [*visdat*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=visdat)
package. Whenever possible,
[*archivist*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=archivist) [@archivist]
hooks are provided for easy access to the presented objects. When a
function call only gives side-effects, a link is provided to the full
result (PDF/PNG files). Tables were prepared with the
[*xtable*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=xtable) package [@xtable].

## The *arsenal* package

The [*arsenal*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=arsenal) package
[@arsenal] is a set of four tools for data exploration:

1.  table of descriptive statistics and p-values of associated
    statistical tests, grouped by levels of a target variable (the
    so-called *Table 1*). Such a table can also be created for paired
    observation, for example longitudinal data (`tableby` and `paired`
    functions),

2.  comparison of two data frames that can detect shared variables
    (`compare` function),

3.  frequency tables for categorical variables (`freqlist` function),

4.  fitting and summarizing simple statistical models (linear
    regression, Cox model, etc) in tables of estimates, confidence
    intervals and p-values (`modelsum` function).

Results of each function can be saved to a short report using the
`write2` function. An example[^5] can be found in Figure
[2](#fig:arsenaltable).

A separate vignette is available for each of the functions. `arsenal` is
the most statistically-oriented package among reviewed libraries. It
borrows heavily from SAS-style procedures used by the authors at the
Mayo Clinic.

![Figure 2: An example output from the `arsenal::tableby` function saved
using `arsenal::write2` (*arsenal* v 2.0). `Smokes` and `Race` variables
are compared by the levels of `Died`
variable.](arsenaltablecut.PNG){#fig:arsenaltable width="100%"
alt="graphic without alt text"}

## The *autoEDA* package

*autoEDA* package [@autoeda] is a GitHub-based tool for univariate and
bivariate visualizations and summaries. The `dataOverview` function
returns a data frame that describes each feature by its type, number of
missing values, outliers and typical descriptive statistics. Values
proposed for imputation are also included. Two outlier detection methods
are available: Tukey and percentile-based. A PDF report can be created
using the `autoEDA` function. It consists of the plots of distributions
of predictors grouped by outcome variable or distribution of outcome by
predictors.

The package can be found on Xander Horn's GitHub page:
<https://github.com/XanderHorn/autoEDA>. It does not include a vignette,
but a short introduction article was published to LinkedIn
[@autoedablog] and similar examples can be found in the readme of the
project. Plots from a report[^6] generated by *autoEDA* are displayed in
Figure [3](#fig:autoeedaex).

![Figure 3: Sample pages from the report generated by the
`autoEDA::autoEDA` function (*autoEDA* v. 1.0) displaying bivariate
relationships between the target and explanatory
variable.](autoeda_example.png){#fig:autoeedaex width="5in"
height="3.5in"}

## The *DataExplorer* package

[*DataExplorer*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=DataExplorer)
[@dataexplorer] is a recent package that helps automatize EDA and simple
data transformations. It provides functions for:

1.  whole dataset summary: dimensions, types of variables, missing
    values, etc (`introduce` and `plot_intro` functions),

2.  missing values profile as a plot of missing values fraction per
    column (`plot_missing` function) or summary statistics and suggested
    actions (`profile_missing` function),

3.  plotting distributions of variables, separately numerical and
    categorical (`plot_histogram` and `plot_bar` functions),

4.  QQ Plots (`plot_qq` function),

5.  plotting correlation matrices (`plot_correlation` function),

6.  visualizing PCA results by plotting percentage of explained variance
    and correlations with each original feature for every principal
    component (`plot_prcomp` function),

7.  plotting relationships between the target variable and predictors -
    scatterplots and boxplots (`plot_scatterplot` and `plot_boxplot`
    functions),

8.  data transformation: replacing missing values by a constant
    (`set_missing` function), grouping sparse categories
    (`group_category` function), creating dummy variables, dropping
    columns (`dummify`, `drop_features` functions) and modifying columns
    (`update_columns` function).

The `create_report` function generates a report. By default, it consists
of all the above points except for data transformations and it can be
further customized. An introductory vignette *Introduction to
DataExplorer* that showcases all the functionalities is included in the
package. It is noticeable that the package almost entirely relies on
visual techniques. Plots taken from an example report[^7] are presented
in Figure [4](#fig:dataexplorerreport).

![Figure 4: A visualization of PCA results - correlation with original
variables for each principal component - and a *wall of bar plots* taken
from a report generated by the `DataExplorer::create_report` function
(*DataExplorer* v.
0.7).](dataexplorer_example.png){#fig:dataexplorerreport width="100%"
alt="graphic without alt text"}

## The *dataMaid* package

The [*dataMaid*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=dataMaid)
[@datamaid] package has two central functions: the `check` function,
which performs checks of data consistency and validity, and `summarize`,
which summarizes each column. Another function, `makeDataReport`,
automatically creates a report in PDF, DOCX or HTML format. The goal is
to detect missing and unusual - outlying or incorrectly encoded -
values. The report contains whole dataset summary: variables and their
types, number of missing values, and univariate summaries in the form of
descriptive statistics, histograms/bar plots and an indication of
possible problems.

User-defined checks and summaries can be also included in the analysis.
The vignette *Extending dataMaid* explains how to define them. It is
also possible to customize the report. In particular, variables for
which no problems were detected can be ommited. An example report[^8]
can be found in Figure [5](#fig:datamaidexample).

![Figure 5: Two pages from a data validity report generated using the
`dataMaid::makeDataReport` function (*dataMaid* v. 1.2). Atypical values
are listed under the variable
summary.](datamaid_example.png){#fig:datamaidexample width="100%"
alt="graphic without alt text"}

## The *dlookr* package

The [*dlookr*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=dlookr) [@dlookr]
package provides tools for 3 types of analysis: data diagnosis including
correctness, missing values, outlier detection; exploratory data
analysis; and variable transformations: imputation, dichotomization, and
transformation of continuous features. It can also automatically
generate a PDF report for all these analyses.

For data diagnosis, types of variables are reported along with counts of
missing values and unique values. Variables with a low proportion of
unique values are described separately. All the typical descriptive
statistics are provided for each variable. Outliers are detected and
distributions of variables before and after outlier removal are plotted.
Both missing values and outliers can be treated using `impute_na` and
`impute_outlier` functions.

In the EDA report, descriptive statistics are presented along with
normality tests, histograms of variables and their transformations that
reduce skewness: logarithm and root square. Correlation plots are shown
for numerical variables. If the target variable is specified, plots that
show the relationship between the target and each predictor are also
included.

A transformation report compares descriptive statistics and plots for
each variable before and after imputation, skewness-removing
transformation and binning. If the right transformation is found among
the candidate transformations, it can be applied to the feature through
one of the `binning`, `binning_by`, or `transform` functions.

Every operation or summary presented in the reports can also be
performed manually. A dedicated vignette explains each of the main
functionalities (*Data quality diagnosis*, *Data Transformation*,
*Exploratory Data Analysis* vignettes). An example[^9] taken from one of
the reports can be found in Figure [6](#fig:dlookreda).

![Figure 6: Two pages from a report generated by the
`dlookr::eda_report` function (*dlookr* v. 0.3.8). First, the dataset is
summarised, than each variable is described. Optionally, plots of
bivariate relationships can be
added.](dlookr_example.png){#fig:dlookreda width="100%"
alt="graphic without alt text"}

## The *ExPanDaR* package

Notably, while the
[*ExPanDaR*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=ExPanDaR) package
[@panel] was designed for panel data exploration, it can also be used
for standard EDA after adding an artificial constant time index. In this
case, the package offers interactive *shiny* application for
exploration. Several types of analysis are covered:

1.  missing values and outlier treatment,

2.  univariate summaries (descriptive statistics) and plots
    (histograms/bar plots),

3.  bivariate analysis via correlation matrices and plots.
    Interestingly, scatter plots can be enriched by associating size and
    color of points with variables,

4.  multivariate regression analysis.

For each functionality of the application, there is a corresponding
standalone function.

Three vignettes describe how the library can be used for data
exploration (*Using the functions of the ExPanDaR package*), how to
customize it (*Customize ExPanD*) and how to analyze panel data ( *Using
ExPanD for Panel Data Exploration*) Example instances of *ExPanDaR*
*shiny* applications are available online. Links and other examples can
be found in the GitHub repository of the package:
<https://github.com/joachim-gassen/ExPanDaR>. An example of a scatter
plot[^10] created by the package can be found in Figure
[7](#fig:expandar).

variable denoted by the color. Created with the `prepare_scatter_plot`
function (*ExPanDaR* v0.4.0).](expandar_scatter.png){#fig:expandar
width="100%" alt="graphic without alt text"}

## The *explore* package

The functionalities of the
[*explore*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=explore) package
[@explore] can be accessed in three ways: through an interactive
[*shiny*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=shiny) [@shinysta]
application, through an automatically generated HTML report or via
standalone functions. In addition to data exploration, relationships
with a binary target can be explored. The package includes functions for

1.  full dataset summaries - dimensions, data types, missing values and
    summary statistics (`describe` function),

2.  uni- and bivariate visualizations, including density plots, bar
    plots and boxplots (a family of `explore` functions, in particular
    `explore_all` function that creates plots for all variables),

3.  simple modeling based on decision trees (`explain_tree` function) or
    logistic regression (`explain_logreg` function).

All result can be saved to HTML via the `report` function. Dataset and
variable summaries can also be save to an MD file using the
`data_dict_md` function[^11]. The *explore* vignette includes a thorough
description of the package. An example decision tree[^12] can be found
in Figure [8](#fig:decisiontree).

## The *exploreR* package

The [*exploreR*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=exploreR) package
[@explorer] takes a unique approach to data exploration compared to
other packages. The analysis is based on linear regression. There are
three functionalities:

1.  fitting univariate regression model for each independent variable
    and summarizing the results in a table that consists of estimated
    parameters, p-values, and $R^{2}$ values (`masslm` function),

2.  plotting target variable against each independent variable along
    with the fitted least squares line (`massregplot` function),

3.  feature standardization by scaling to the interval $[0, 1]$ or
    subtracting mean and dividing by standard deviation.

Regression plots can be saved to a PDF file. A vignette called *The How
and Why of Simple Tools* explains all the functions and provides
examples. One of the regression plots[^13] is presented in Figure
[9](#fig:explorer).

`exploreR::massregplot` (*exploreR* v.
0.1).](explorer_plot.png){#fig:explorer width="100%"

## The *funModeling* package

The package
[*funModeling*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=funModeling)
[@funmodeling] is a rich set of tools for EDA connected to the book
[@datasciencelive]. These tools include

1.  dataset summary (`df_status` function),

2.  plots and descriptive statistics for categorical and numerical
    variables (`plot_num`, `profiling_num` and `freq` functions),

3.  classical and information theory-based correlation analysis for
    target variable vs other variables - (`correlation_table` function
    for numerical predictors, `var_rank_info` function for all
    predictors),

4.  plots of distribution of target variables vs predictors (bar plots,
    box plots and histograms via `cross_plot` and `plotar` functions),

5.  quantitative analysis for binary target variables (`categ_analysis`
    function),

6.  different methods of binning continuous features (`discretize_df`,
    `convert_df_to_categoric` and `discretize_rgr` functions),

7.  variable normalization by transforming to the $[0, 1]$ interval
    (`range01` function),

8.  outlier treatment (`prep_outliers`, `tukey_outlier` and
    `hampel_outlier` functions),

9.  gain and lift curves (`gain_lift` function).

It is the only library that encompasses visualizations related to
predictive models and non-standard correlation analysis. The range of
tools covered by *funModeling* is very wide. The package includes an
exhaustive introduction vignette called **funModeling* quick-start*. One
of the bivariate visualizations[^14] offered by the package can be found
in Figure [10](#fig:funmodeling).

![Figure 10: An example output from the `funModeling::cross_plot`
function (*funModeling* v. 1.7). Such a plot is drawn for every variable
in the dataset or for a specified subset of variables. Continuous
features are discretized.](funmodelingcross.png){#fig:funmodeling
width="100%" alt="graphic without alt text"}

## The *inspectdf* package

The [*inspectdf*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=inspectdf) package
[@inspectdf] provides several tools for basic data exploration with a
consistent interface. Each of the `inspect_*` functions returns a data
frame with summaries (and additional attributes). The results can be
then plotted using the `show_plot` function. The function are related to
three aspects of EDA:

1.  whole dataset can be summarised by numbers of missing values, number
    of variables of each type and memory used by each variable
    (`inspect_na`, `inspect_types` and `inspect_mem` functions),

2.  univariate analysis is done via summary statistics and histograms
    for numerical variables (`inspect_num` function), bar plots for
    categorical variables (`inspect_cat` function). Additionally,
    factors dominated by a single level can be found with the
    `inspect_imb` function,

3.  bivariate relationships are described by Pearson correlation
    coefficient for numerical variables (`inspect_cor` function).

Notably, each function can take two data frames as parameters and return
their comparison. An example of a correlation analysis plot comparing
two data frames can be found in Figure [11](#fig:inspectdf) While the
library does not include a vignette, extensive documentation with
examples is provided on the GitHub webpage of the project:
<https://github.com/alastairrushworth/inspectdf>.

two data frames. Plot created using the *inspectdf* package v.
0.0.3.](inspectdf_plot.png){#fig:inspectdf width="100%"
alt="graphic without alt text"}

## The *RtutoR* package

The [*RtutoR*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=RtutoR) package
[@rtutor] is a tool for automated reporting. There are three options for
creating a report that contains univariate and bivariate data summaries:

1.  plots can be created interactively in a *shiny* app
    (`launch_plotter` function),

2.  the whole report can be generated from a *shiny* app that allows the
    user to tweak the report (`gen_exploratory_report_app` function),

3.  the report can be created by a direct call to the
    `generate_exploratory_analysis_ppt` function.

The report is saved in the `PPTX` format. Notably, this package can
identify the top `k` relevant variables based on a chosen criterion, for
example, information gain, and display plots only for these variables.
An example report can be found in the GitHub repository of the
package[^15]. The package was introduced in an R-Bloggers blog post
[@rtutorblog].

## The *SmartEDA* package

The [*SmartEDA*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=SmartEDA) package
[@smarteda], is focused entirely on data exploration through graphics
and descriptive statistics. It does not provide any functions which
modify existing variables. The range of tools it includes is wide:

1.  dataset summary (`ExpData` function),

2.  descriptive statistics that may include correlation with target
    variable and density or bar plots (`ExpNumStat`, `ExpNumViz`,
    `ExpCatStat` and `ExpCatViz` functions). All visualizations may
    include the target variable,

3.  QQ plots (`ExpOutQQ` function),

4.  contingency tables (`ExpCTable` function),

5.  information value and Weight of the Evidence coding (`ExpWoETable`,
    `ExpInfoValue` functions),

6.  parallel coordinate plot for multivariate visualization
    (`ExpParcoord` function).

Plotting functions return grids of *ggplot2* object. The results can be
written to a HTML report (`ExpReport` function). There are also
additional functionalities dedicated to `data.table` objects from
[*data.table*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=data.table) package
[@datatable]. An introductory vignette called *Explore data using
SmartEDA (Intro)* is attached to the library. Another vignette *Custom
summary statistics* describe customizing output tables. The package is
also described in the [@smartedapaper] paper. Examples[^16] can be found
in Figure [12](#fig:smartedareport).

![Figure 12: Sample pages from a report generated by the
`SmartEDA::ExpReport` function (*SmartEDA* v. 0.3), including dataset
overview and bivariate dependency for categorical
variables.](smarteda_example.png){#fig:smartedareport width="100%"
alt="graphic without alt text"}

## The *summarytools* package

The [*summarytools*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=summarytools)
package [@summarytools] builds summary tables for whole datasets,
individual variables, or pairs of variables. In addition, the output can
be formatted to be included in
[*knitr*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=knitr)[@knitr] or plain
documents, HTML files and
[*shiny*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=shiny) apps [@shinysta].
The are four main functionalities:

1.  whole dataset summary including variable types and a limited number
    of descriptive statistics, counts of unique values and missing
    values and univariate plots within the output table (`dfSummary`
    function),

2.  descriptive statistics, including skewness and kurtosis, for
    numerical variables, possibly grouped by levels of a factor
    (`descr`, `stby` functions),

3.  counts and proportions for levels of categorical features (`freq`
    function),

4.  contingency tables for pairs of categorical variables (`ctable`
    function).

All results can be saved and displayed in different formats. The package
includes a vignette titled *Introduction to summarytools*. An example of
univariate summaries[^17] can be found in Figure
[3](#table:summarytoolstbl).

## The *visdat* package

The package *visdat* [@visdat] is maintained by rOpenSci. It consists of
six functions that help visualize:

1.  variables types and missing data (`vis_dat` function),

2.  types of each value in each column (`vis_guess` function),

3.  clusters of missing values (`vis_miss` function),

4.  differences between the two datasets (`vis_compare` function),

5.  where given conditions are satisfied in the data (`vis_expect`
    function),

6.  correlation matrix for the numerical variables (`vis_cor` function).

Each of these functions returns a single
[*ggplot2*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=ggplot2) [@ggplot] plot
that shows a rectangular representation of the dataset where the
expected information is denoted by colors. An example of this
visualization[^18] can be seen in Figure [13](#fig:visguess).

The package includes a vignette *Using visdat* that provides examples
for all package options. Interestingly, it is the only package that use
solely visual means of exploring the data.

![Figure 13: Example output of the `visdat::vis_guess` function
(*visdat* v. 0.5.3), which displays types of each value in the data
frame and the missing values. We can see that the `Age` variable
consists of integer values, even though it is coded as a
`character`.](visguess.png){#fig:visguess width="100%"
alt="graphic without alt text"}

## The *xray* package

The [*xray*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=xray) [@xray] package
has three functions for the analysis of data prior to statistical
modeling:

1.  detecting anomalies: missing data, zero values, blank strings, and
    infinite numbers (`anomalies` function),

2.  drawing and printing univariate distributions of each variable
    through histograms, bar plots and quantile tables (`distributions`
    function),

3.  drawing plots of variables over time for a specified time variable
    (`timebased` function).

Examples are presented in the readme file in the GitHub repository of
the project (<https://github.com/sicarul/xray>), but no vignette is
attached to it. Plots[^19] generated by the package are presented in
Figure [14](#fig:xrayplot).

![Figure 14: Example output from the `xray::distributions` function
(*xray* v. 0.2). Such plots are created for each variable in the dataset
along with a table of descriptive
statistics.](xrayplot.png){#fig:xrayplot width="100%"
alt="graphic without alt text"}

## Other packages {#other}

As mentioned before, there are numerous R packages that aim to make data
exploration faster or the outputs more polished.

For table summaries of data that often include statistical tests, there
are a few packages worth mentioning. The package
[*tableone*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=tableone) [@tableone]
provides a `CreateTableOne` function to make publication-ready tables
referred to as *Table 1* - traditional name of tables that describe
patients' characteristics, usually stratified and including p-values
from significance tests. The `describe` function from
[*describer*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=describer) package
[@describer] prints a summary of a `data.frame` or a vector which
includes data types, counts and descriptive statistics. Similarly, the
[*skimr*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=skimr) [@skimr] package
summarises data frames, vectors and matrices. It can also handled
grouped data frames. The summary consist of data dimensions, missing and
complete value counts, typical descriptive statistics and simple
histograms. A function of the same name from
[*prettyR*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=prettyR) [@prettyr]
returns descriptive statistics for each column in a `data.frame`. This
package is focused on improving the aesthetics of R statistical outputs.
Similarly, the package
[*Hmisc*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=Hmisc) [@hmisc] includes a
`describe` function that displays typical descriptive statistics and
number of unique and missing values for each column. The `plot` method
called on the result of the `describe` function returns a dot plot for
each categorical and a spike histogram for each continuous column. The
scope of this package is bigger than just Exploratory Data Analysis, as
it includes many tools related to regression models.

There are also many packages related to data visualization. Two of them
are particularly worth mentioning. The
[*ggfortify*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=ggfortify) package
[@ggfortify] serves as a uniform interface to plots of different
statistical objects, including PCA results that can be used for data
exploration and time series plots. The
[*autoplotly*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=autoplotly) library
[@autoplotly] was built on top of *ggfortify* to provide automatically
generated, interactive visualizations of many statistical models. While
these two packages are focused on statistical modeling, they can be
helpful in exploratory analysis and exemplify the potential of quick and
interactive visualization in R.

Two more packages are relevant to our interest.
[*gpairs*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=gpairs) [@gpairs] and
[*GGally*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=GGally) [@ggally] packages
implement the generalized pairs plot [@gpp]. This type of plot extends
well known scatter plot matrices, that visualize bivariate relationships
for many variables, by handling both numerical and categorical
variables. It is helpful in data exploration and shares similarities to
*walls of histograms* that can be found in automated EDA libraries.

# Feature comparison {#chapter:feature}

In this section, we compare how different packages address autoEDA tasks
as described in Section [1.1](#chapter:tasks). A quick overview of the
functionalities of different packages can be found in Table

## Data description

Almost all packages contain functions for summarizing datasets. Tools
that support data validity analysis are less common.

### Whole dataset summaries

Most packages that provide a whole dataset summary take a similar
approach and present names and types of variables, number of missing
values and sometimes unique values or other statistics. This is true for
*summarytools* (`dfSummary` function), *autoEDA* (`dataOverview`
function), *dataMaid* (`makeDataReport` result), *funModeling*
(`df_status` function), *explore* (`describe` function), *ExPanDaR*
(`prepare_descriptive_table` function), and *DataExplorer* (`introduce`
function). These outputs are sometimes mixed with univariate summaries.
That is the case for one of the most popular summary-type functions: the
`dfSummary` functions from the *summarytools* package. An example is
given in Figure [15](#fig:wholedfsum).

![Figure 15: An example of whole data frame description that includes
univariate summary and simple graphics. Created with the
`dfSummary function` (*summarytools* package v.
0.9.3).](wholedf.png){#fig:wholedfsum width="100%"
alt="graphic without alt text"}

In the *dlookr* package, summaries for numerical variables and
categorical variables are only presented separately in the report
(`describe` function).

The *visdat* package introduces the most original summaries of full
dataset. The drawback of this approach is that it is not well suited for
high dimensional data. But for a smaller number of variables, it gives a
good overview of the dataset.

### Data validity

Some packages can perform automated checks for the data, including at
least outlier detection. The *dataMaid* package's main purpose is to
find inconsistencies and errors in the data. It finds possible outliers,
missing values, low-frequency and possibly miscoded factor levels. All
this information can be summarised in a quality report. The *dlookr*
package covers similar functionality. There are two main differences:
the report does not describe possibly miscoded factors, but outlier
analysis is supplemented with plots showing variable distribution before
and after removing the outliers. In all cases, the analysis is rather
simple, for example in zero-inflated variables non-zero values are
treated as outliers (*dlookr*). The *ExPanDaR* packages handles outliers
by providing function that calculate winsorized or trimmed mean. Other
packages only provide information about the number of missing
values/outliers and identify columns that consist of a single value.

## Data exploration

While multivariate analysis is rarely supported, there are many tools
for descriptive and graphical exploration of uni- and bivariate patterns
in the data.

### Univariate statistics

All the tools that support univariate analysis take a similar approach
to univariate analysis. For categorical variables, counts are reported
and bar plots are presented, while histogram or boxplots and typical
descriptive statistics (including quantiles, sometimes skewness) are
used for continuous variables.

In *dataMaid* and *dlookr* packages, these plots are presented
variable-by-variable in the report. In other packages (*DataExplorer*,
*funModeling*, *SmartEDA*, *inspectdf*) groups of plots of the same type
are shown together - as a wall of histograms or bar plots. Similarly,
the *explore* package present all the plots at once. The *ExPanDaR*
package allows user to choose variables to display in a *shiny*
applications. Notably, *dlookr* reports skewness of variables and in
case a skewed variable is found, it shows the distribution after some
candidate transformations to reduce the skewness have been applied. This
library also reports normality. The *SmartEDA* package also reports
skewness and displays QQ plots against normal distribution, but it does
not provide any means of reducing skewness.

### Bivariate statistics

The *funModeling* and *SmartEDA* packages only support calculating
correlations between variables and a specified target. *DataExplorer*
and *visdat* packages can plot correlation matrices. They differ in
categorical variables treatment. Some packages require only numerical
features (*visdat*). Interestingly, in *DataExplorer*[^20],
low-cardinality categorical features are converted to 0-1 variables and
plotted alongside numerical variables, as seen in Figure
[16](#fig:decorr).

![Figure 16: Correlation plot as returned by the
`DataExplorer::plot_correlation` function.](corplot_DE.png){#fig:decorr
width="100%" alt="graphic without alt text"}

The *arsenal* package only presents variable summaries by levels of a
chosen categorical variable. The report from the *autoEDA* package
consists of a limited number of bar plots/boxplots with target variable
as one of the dimensions. Similarly, in *DataExplorer*, *dlookr*,
*funModeling* and *SmartEDA*, scatter plots and box plots or histograms
with a specified target variable on one of the axis can be plotted.
Additionally, *funModeling* and *dlookr* draw histograms/densities of
continuous features by the target. In *shiny* applications provided by
*ExPanDaR* and *explore* packages, the user can choose target variables
and explanatory variables to display bivariate plots. Interestingly,
scatter plots provided by the *ExPanDaR* package can be extended to
display multivariate dependencies by mapping variables to size and color
of the points. The *funModeling* package also has unique options:
drawing bar plots of discretized variables by the target and
quantitative analysis for binary outcome based on representativeness and
accuracy. *arsenal*, *summarytools* and *SmartEDA* also feature
contingency tables. Moreover, *exploreR* and *ExPanDaR* packages use
linear regression plots and statistics to find relationships between the
target and other variables. The *explore* package can only handle binary
targets, but it allows user to fit and plot a decision tree model.

## Data cleaning and data transformation

The *dataMaid* package assumes that every decision regarding the data
should be made by the analyst and does not provide any tools for data
manipulation after diagnosis. Most of the packages only provide
exploration tools. Exceptions are *dlookr*, *funModeling*,
*DataExplorer* and *exploreR*. *DataExplorer* provides tools for
normalization, imputation by a constant, merging levels of factors,
creating dummy variables and transforming columns.

The *dlookr* package can create a report that presents different
possible transformations of features. Missing values can be imputed by
mean/median/mode and distributions of variables before and after the
procedure can be compared. The same is done for imputation of outliers.
Logarithmic and root square transforms are proposed for skewed
variables. Different methods of binning continuous variables are also
presented, including Weight of the Evidence.

The *funModeling* package can perform discretization of a variable using
an equal frequency criterion or gain ratio maximization. It can also
scale variables to the interval $[0, 1]$. Outliers can be treated using
the Tukey or Hampel method.

## Reporting

*DataExplorer*, *dlookr*, *dataMaid*, *SmartEDA*, *explore* and *RtutoR*
have an option of generating a report and saving it to a file. Such a
report usually consists of all or most possible outputs of the package.
The plots and summaries are organized by the exploration task (for
example univariate, then bivariate analysis) and either simply
variable-by-variable (*dataMaid*, *dlookr*) or grouped by variable type
(*DataExplorer*, *SmartEDA*). The *autoEDA* package generates a minimal
report with bivariate plots. Packages *arsenal*, *funModeling*, *xray*,
*summarytools* and *exploreR* have an option of saving outputs - plots
or tables - to files.

# Discussion {#chapter:summary}

Automated EDA can be either directed towards a general understanding of
a particular dataset or be more model-oriented, serving as a foundation
for good modeling. While presented packages include some tools related
to simple variable transformations, they are more focused on data
understanding. For this task, they have many advantages. In this
section, we summarize the strong points of existing tools and point out
some possible improvements and new directions for autoEDA.

## Strengths of autoEDA packages

1.  The packages *dlookr*, *dataMaid*, *DataExplorer*, *SmartEDA* are
    capable of creating good quality reports.

2.  *DataExplorer* has very good visualizations for PCA.

3.  *DataExplorer* handles categorical variables on correlation plots by
    creating dummy features, which is a unique idea compared to other
    packages.

4.  The *visdat* package, while probably not the best choice for high
    dimensional data, features interesting take on initial whole dataset
    exploration.

5.  The *dlookr* package is capable of selecting skewed variables and
    proposing transformations. Some of the other packages display binned
    continuous variables, which can also help in seeing visualizing
    dependencies.

6.  *dataMaid* is a good tool for finding problems in the data. Thanks
    to the structure of `check` and `summarize` functions results,
    discovered issues can be treated effectively.

7.  For datasets with a moderate number of features, *DataExplorer*,
    *funModeling*, *dlookr* and *SmartEDA* give a reasonable insight
    into variables distributions and simple relationships.

8.  *SmartEDA* package provides a method of visualizing multivariate
    relationships - parallel coordinate plot.

9.  The *exploreR* package provides usefuls tool for assessing bivariate
    relationship through linear regression.

We can see that tasks related to data quality and whole dataset summary
are well by the existing libraries. Getting the big picture of the data
and finding possible data quality problems is easy, especially with the
*dataMaid* package. For classical applications, for example, statistical
analyses in medicine, the current tools provide very good tables, such
as the ones from *tableone* or *arsenal* packages, and uni-/bivariate
plots. The *inspectdf* and *summarytools* packages can also provide
quick insights into a dataset. Univariate analysis can be performed
either variable-after-variable (*dlookr*, *dataMaid*), where we can see
the statistical properties of each variable, or as groups of plots based
on variable type (*DataExplorer*, *funModeling*). Both ways can be
useful for a reasonable number of predictors. While multivariate tools
are scarce, the available tools, PCA in *DataExplorer* and PCP in
*SmartEDA*, are very well done. Notably, the *ExPanDaR* package provides
very high flexibility thanks to the possibility of interactively
choosing variables to display, adding new variables on-the-fly and
customizing plots in the *shiny* application.

## Future directions and possible improvements

The field of autoEDA is growing. New packages are being developed
rapidly - there are recent additions from April and May. Features are
added to existing packages and bugs are corrected, as new issues are
suggested by users on GitHub. At this moment, we can identify the
following problems and challenges.

All the presented tools can fail in situations with imperfect data. In
particular, they are usually not robust to issues like
zero-variance/constant variables. Such problems are expected to be
solved in the nearest future, as suggested for example by issues in the
GitHub repo of the *DataExplorer* package. In general, error messages
can be uninformative. Moreover, in some situations, they lack
flexibility. For example, in *DataExplorer* arguments can be passed to
`cor` function, but not to `corrplot` function.

In case of *walls of histograms* (or bar plots), no selection is being
done and no specific order is chosen to promote most interesting
distributions. The same is true for automatically created reports. This
problem is only addressed by the *RtutoR* package, which allows to
select top `k` relevant variables. Moreover, for high-dimensional data
or high-cardinality factors, the plots often become unreadable or
impractical. Partial solutions to this problems are applied, for example
*DataExplorer* removes too large factors from the panels. More
generally, many GitHub issues for the described packages are related to
customizing and improving plots and output tables. It is a challenging
task due to the diversity of possible input data and a major concern for
developers of autoEDA packages.

Typical EDA tasks are limited to exploring bivariate relationships.
Searching for higher dimensional dependencies would be interesting, for
example by adding color and size dimensions to the plots, which was
already done in the *ExPanDaR* package. For *wall of plots* type of
display, such an addition would result in a large number of new plots.
Thus, it would require a proper method of finding the most relevant
visualization. Interactivity partially helps address this issue. PCA,
parallel coordinate plots and model summaries are supported, but each by
a separate package. It is evident that there is a shortage of
multivariate tools. Univariate regression models can be plotted by the
*exploreR* package. The *explore* package plots decision trees for
binary target variables. In other cases, exploration based on simple
statistical models (such as scatter plot smoothing) is not an option.
Using regression models and feature transformations to identify and
measure relevant relationships could improve bivariate or multivariate
analyses supported by automated EDA.

Regarding variable transformation, only one of the packages addresses
the issue of skewed variables. Proposing transformations of continuous
features other than binning would be helpful and could improve
visualizations, for example, scatter plots with skewed variables.
Missing data imputation more advanced than imputing a constant is
delegated to other packages, although, it is known that imputation by a
constant is usually not the best method of missing values treatment.
Some of the above issues limit the packages' usefulness in iterative
work. Though, the comparisons of transform and original features and the
possibility of applying discovered transformations to data in *dlookr*
package are steps in the right direction.

Support for time-varying variables and non-classical (not IID) problems
such as survival analysis is limited or non-existent. For survival
analysis, the automation level is low, but there are two notable tools
for summarizing dependencies. First is the recognized package
[*survminer*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=survminer)
[@survminer], which helps visualize survival curves, while also
displaying survival tables and other information. The other tool is the
[*cr17*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=cr17) package [@cr17], which
includes `summarizeCR` function that returns several tables and plots
for competing risks analysis. More tools for fast visualization of at
least bivariate relationships in such problems would be a big help for
analysts. Cluster analysis is sometimes regarded a part of the EDA
process, but it is not available in any of the packages.

The tools available in R have similar range to other languages'
libraries, for example from Python. Python packages such as Dora [@dora]
or lens [@lens] also cover feature-by-feature descriptive statistics and
plots, bivariate visualizations of the relationships between predictors
and target variable, contingency tables, basic data transformations, and
imputation. Tools for visual data exploration supports also tools for
visual model exploration like
[*DALEX*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=DALEX) [@DALEX] or
[*iml*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=iml) [@imlsta]. In both cases
visual summaries help to quickly grasp key relations between variables
or between input features and model predictions.

Since EDA is both closely connected to feature engineering and based on
visual insights, automated EDA can draw from existing tools for
automated feature extraction like SAFE ML [@2019arXiv190211035G] or TPOT
[@tpot] and visualization recommendations. When it comes to aiding
visual exploration of a dataset, standalone software carries
possibilities beyond what we can expect from R packages or analogous
libraries in other languages. A recent notable example is DIVE
[@2018-dive]. It is an example of a growing number of tools for visual
data exploration that aim to distinguish between relevant and irrelevant
visualization and help the analyst find the most interesting plots. DIVE
is one of the *mixed-initiative visualization systems*, meaning it uses
both statistical properties of the dataset and user interactions to find
the relevant plots. Building recommendation systems into autoEDA tools
can help address the issue of dealing with high-dimensional data and
multivariate dependencies by letting the ML-based system deal with the
complexity of a large number of candidate visualizations. AI-assisted
data exploration can be even faster and more efficient.

As autoEDA tools are still maturing, the efforts in the field are
somewhat fragmented. Many packages try to achieve similar goals, but
they can be quite inconsistent. It is especially visible in the
multiplicity of names for the `summary`-type function to describe a
whole data frame. As the libraries develop, new standards and
conventions should be proposed.
