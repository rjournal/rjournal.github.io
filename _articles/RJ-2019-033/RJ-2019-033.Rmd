title: The Landscape of R Packages for Automated Exploratory Data Analysis
abstract: The increasing availability of large but noisy data sets with a large number
  of heterogeneous variables leads to the increasing interest in the automation of
  common tasks for data analysis. The most time-consuming part of this process is
  the Exploratory Data Analysis, crucial for better domain understanding, data cleaning,
  data validation, and feature engineering. There is a growing number of libraries
  that attempt to automate some of the typical Exploratory Data Analysis tasks to
  make the search for new insights easier and faster. In this paper, we present a
  systematic review of existing tools for Automated Exploratory Data Analysis (autoEDA).
  We explore the features of fifteen popular R packages to identify the parts of analysis
  that can be effectively automated with the current tools and to point out new directions
  for further autoEDA development.
