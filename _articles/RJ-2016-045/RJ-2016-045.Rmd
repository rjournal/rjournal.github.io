title: 'Ake: An R Package for Discrete and Continuous Associated Kernel Estimations'
abstract: Kernel estimation is an important technique in exploratory data analysis.
  Its utility relies on its ease of interpretation, especially based on graphical
  means. The Ake package is introduced for univariate density or probability mass
  function estimation and also for continuous and discrete regression functions using
  associated kernel estimators. These associated kernels have been proposed due to
  their specific features of variables of interest. The package focuses on associated
  kernel methods appropriate for continuous (bounded, positive) or discrete (count,
  categorical) data often found in applied settings. Furthermore, optimal bandwidths
  are selected by cross-validation for any associated kernel and by Bayesian methods
  for the binomial kernel. Other Bayesian methods for selecting bandwidths with other
  associated kernels will complete this package in its future versions; particularly,
  a Bayesian adaptive method for gamma kernel estimation of density functions is developed.
  Some practical and theoretical aspects of the normalizing constant in both density
  and probability mass functions estimations are given.
