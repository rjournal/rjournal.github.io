title: 'Associative Classification in R: arc, arulesCBA, and rCBA'
abstract: Several methods for creating classifiers based on rules discovered via association
  rule mining have been proposed in the literature. These classifiers are called associative
  classifiers and the best-known algorithm is Classification Based on Associations
  (CBA). Interestingly, only very few implementations are available and, until recently,
  no implementation was available for R. Now, three packages provide CBA. This paper
  introduces associative classification, the CBA algorithm, and how it can be used
  in R. A comparison of the three packages is provided to give the potential user
  an idea about the advantages of each of the implementations. We also show how the
  packages are related to the existing infrastructure for association rule mining
  already available in R.
