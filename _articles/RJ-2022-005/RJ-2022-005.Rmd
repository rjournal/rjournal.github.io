title: 'cpsurvsim: An R Package for Simulating Data from Change-Point Hazard Distributions'
abstract: Change-point hazard models have several practical applications, including
  modeling processes such as cancer mortality rates and disease progression. While
  the inverse cumulative distribution function (CDF) method is commonly used for simulating
  data, we demonstrate the shortcomings of this approach when simulating data from
  change-point hazard distributions with more than a scale parameter. We propose an
  alternative method of simulating this data that takes advantage of the memoryless
  property of survival data and introduce the R package cpsurvsim which implements
  both simulation methods. The functions of cpsurvsim are discussed, demonstrated,
  and compared.
