title: 'quantreg.nonpar: An R Package for Performing Nonparametric Series Quantile
  Regression'
abstract: The R package quantreg.nonpar implements nonparametric quantile regression
  methods to estimate and make inference on partially linear quantile models. quantreg.nonpar
  obtains point estimates of the conditional quantile function and its derivatives
  based on series approximations to the nonparametric part of the model. It also provides
  pointwise and uniform confidence intervals over a region of covariate values and/or
  quantile indices for the same functions using analytical and resampling methods.
  This paper serves as an introduction to the package and displays basic functionality
  of the functions contained within.
