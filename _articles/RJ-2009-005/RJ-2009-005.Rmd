title: 'expert: Modeling Without Data Using Expert Opinion'
abstract: The expert package provides tools to create and manipulate empirical statistical
  models using expert opinion (or judgment). Here, the latter expression refers to
  a specific body of techniques to elicit the distribution of a random variable when
  data is scarce or unavailable. Opinions on the quantiles of the distribution are
  sought from experts in the field and aggregated into a final estimate. The package
  supports aggregation by means of the Cooke, Mendel–Sheridan and predefined weights
  models.
