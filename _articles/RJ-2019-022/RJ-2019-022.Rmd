title: 'SimCorrMix: Simulation of Correlated Data with Multiple Variable Types Including
  Continuous and Count Mixture Distributions'
abstract: The SimCorrMix package generates correlated continuous (normal, non-normal,
  and mix ture), binary, ordinal, and count (regular and zero-inflated, Poisson and
  Negative Binomial) variables that mimic real-world data sets. Continuous variables
  are simulated using either Fleishman’s third order or Headrick’s fifth-order power
  method transformation. Simulation occurs at the component level for continuous mixture
  distributions, and the target correlation matrix is specified in terms of correlations
  with components. However, the package contains functions to approximate expected
  correlations with continuous mixture variables. There are two simulation pathways
  which calculate intermediate correlations involving count variables differently,
  increasing accuracy under a wide range of parameters. The package also provides
  functions to calculate cumulants of continuous mixture distributions, check parameter
  inputs, calculate feasible correlation boundaries, and summarize and plot simulated
  variables. SimCorrMix is an important addition to existing R simulation packages
  because it is the first to include continuous mixture and zero-inflated count variables
  in correlated data sets.
