title: 'factorplot: Improving Presentation of Simple Contrasts in Generalized Linear
  Models'
abstract: Recent statistical literature has paid attention to the presentation of
  pairwise comparisons either from the point of view of the reference category problem
  in generalized linear models (GLMs) or in terms of multiple comparisons. Both schools
  of thought are interested in the parsimonious presentation of sufficient information
  to enable readers to evaluate the significance of contrasts resulting from the inclusion
  of qualitative variables in GLMs. These comparisons also arise when trying to interpret
  multinomial models where one category of the dependent variable is omitted as a
  reference. While considerable advances have been made, opportunities remain to improve
  the presentation of this information, especially in graphical form. The factorplot
  package provides new functions for graphically and numerically presenting results
  of hypothesis tests related to pairwise comparisons resulting from qualitative covariates
  in GLMs or coefficients in multinomial logistic regression models.
