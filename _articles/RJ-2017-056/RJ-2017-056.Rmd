title: 'Splitting It Up: The spduration Split-Population Duration Regression Package
  for Time-Varying Covariates'
abstract: We present an implementation of split-population duration regression in
  the spduration (Beger et al., 2017) package for R that allows for time-varying covariates.
  The statistical model accounts for units that are immune to a certain outcome and
  are not part of the duration process the researcher is primarily interested in.
  We provide insights for when immune units exist, that can significantly increase
  the predictive performance compared to standard duration models. The package includes
  estimation and several post-estimation methods for split-population Weibull and
  log-logistic models. We provide an empirical application to data on military coups.
