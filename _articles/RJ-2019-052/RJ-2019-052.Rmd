title: 'lpirfs: An R Package to Estimate Impulse Response Functions by Local Projections'
abstract: Impulse response analysis is a cornerstone in applied (macro-)econometrics.
  Estimating impulse response functions using local projections (LPs) has become an
  appealing alternative to the traditional structural vector autoregressive (SVAR)
  approach. Despite its growing popularity and applications, however, no R package
  yet exists that makes this method available. In this paper, I introduce lpirfs,
  a fast and flexible R package that provides a broad framework to compute and visualize
  impulse response functions using LPs for a variety of data sets.
