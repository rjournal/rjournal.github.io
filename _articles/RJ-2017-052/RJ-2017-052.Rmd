title: 'BayesBD: An R Package for Bayesian Inference on Image Boundaries'
abstract: We present the BayesBD package providing Bayesian inference for boundaries
  of noisy images. The BayesBD package implements flexible Gaussian process priors
  indexed by the circle to recover the boundary in a binary or Gaussian noised image.
  The boundary recovered by BayesBD has the practical advantages of guaranteed geometric
  restrictions and convenient joint inferences under certain assumptions, in addition
  to its desirable theoretical property of achieving (nearly) minimax optimal rate
  in a way that is adaptive to the unknown smoothness. The core sampling tasks for
  our model have linear complexity, and are implemented in C++ for computational efficiency
  using packages Rcpp and RcppArmadillo. Users can access the full functionality of
  the package in both the command line and the corresponding shiny application. Additionally,
  the package includes numerous utility functions to aid users in data preparation
  and analysis of results. We compare BayesBD with selected existing packages using
  both simulations and real data applications, demonstrating the excellent performance
  and flexibility of BayesBD even when the observation contains complicated structural
  information that may violate its assumptions.
