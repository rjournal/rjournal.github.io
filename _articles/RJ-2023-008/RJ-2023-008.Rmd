title: 'dycdtools: an R Package for Assisting Calibration and Visualising Outputs
  of an Aquatic Ecosystem Model'
abstract: ' The high complexity of aquatic ecosystem models (AEMs) necessitates a
  large number of parameters that need calibration, and visualisation of their multifaceted
  and multi-layered simulation results is necessary for effective communication. Here
  we present an R package "dycdtools" that contains calibration and post-processing
  tools for a widely applied aquatic ecosystem model (DYRESM-CAEDYM). The calibration
  assistant function within the package automatically tests a large number of combinations
  of parameter values and returns corresponding values for goodness-of-fit, allowing
  users to narrow parameter ranges or optimise parameter values. The post-processing
  functions enable users to visualise modelling outputs in four ways: as contours,
  profiles, time series, and scatterplots. The "dycdtools" package is the first open-source
  calibration and post-processing tool for DYRESM-CAEDYM, and can also be adjusted
  for other AEMs with a similar structure. This package is useful to reduce the calibration
  burden for users and to effectively communicate model results with a broader community.'
