title: 'Species Distribution Modeling using Spatial Point Processes: a Case Study
  of Sloth Occurrence in Costa Rica'
abstract: Species distribution models are widely used in ecology for conservation
  management of species and their environments. This paper demonstrates how to fit
  a log-Gaussian Cox process model to predict the intensity of sloth occurrence in
  Costa Rica, and assess the effect of climatic factors on spatial patterns using
  the R-INLA package. Species occurrence data are retrieved using spocc, and spatial
  climatic variables are obtained with raster. Spatial data and results are manipulated
  and visualized by means of several packages such as raster and tmap. This paper
  provides an accessible illustration of spatial point process modeling that can be
  used to analyze data that arise in a wide range of fields including ecology, epidemiology
  and the environment.
