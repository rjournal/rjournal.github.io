title: 'ipwErrorY: An R Package for Estimation of Average Treatment Effect with Misclassified
  Binary Outcome'
abstract: It has been well documented that ignoring measurement error may result in
  severely biased inference results. In recent years, there has been limited but increasing
  research on causal inference with measurement error. In the presence of misclassified
  binary outcome variable, Shu and Yi (2017) considered the inverse probability weighted
  estimation of the average treatment effect and proposed valid estimation methods
  to correct for misclassification effects for various settings. To expedite the application
  of those methods for situations where misclassification in the binary outcome variable
  is a real concern, we implement correction methods proposed by Shu and Yi (2017)
  and develop an R package ipwErrorY for general users. Simulated datasets are used
  to illustrate the use of the developed package.
