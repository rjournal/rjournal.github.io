title: An Introduction to Principal Surrogate Evaluation with the pseval Package
abstract: We describe a new package called *pseval* that implements the core methods
  for the evaluation of principal surrogates in a single clinical trial. It provides
  a flexible interface for defining models for the risk given treatment and the surrogate,
  the models for integration over the missing counterfactual surrogate responses,
  and the estimation methods. Estimated maximum likelihood and pseudo-score can be
  used for estimation, and the bootstrap for inference. A variety of post-estimation
  methods are provided, including print, summary, plot, and testing. We summarize
  the main statistical methods that are implemented in the package and illustrate
  its use from the perspective of a novice R user.

# Introduction

A valid principal surrogate endpoint, also called a specific
nonmechanistic correlate of protection [@PLot12], can be used as a
target for treatment improvement in early phase trials and, in the
specific setting of evaluation, for predicting individual treatment
effects post-licensure. A surrogate is considered to be valid if it
provides reliable predictions of treatment effects on the clinical
endpoint of interest. @Frangakis02 introduced the concept of principal
stratification and the definition of a principal surrogate (PS).
Informally, a post-treatment intermediate response variable is a
principal surrogate if causal effects of the treatment on the clinical
outcome only exist when causal effects of the treatment on the
intermediate variable exist. The criteria for a PS have been modified
and extended in more recent works, with most current literature focusing
on wide effect modification as the primary criterion of interest.

The goal of PS evaluation is estimation and testing of how treatment
efficacy on the clinical outcome of interest varies over subgroups
defined by possible treatment and surrogate combinations of interest;
this is an effect modification objective. The combinations of interest
are called the principal strata and they include a set of unobservable
counterfactual responses: responses that would have occurred under a set
of conditions counter to the observed conditions. To finesse this
problem of unobservable responses, a variety of clever trial designs and
estimation approaches have been proposed. Several of these have been
implemented in the [*pseval*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=pseval)
package [@pseval].

# Methods

## Notation

Let $Z_i$ be the treatment indicator for subject $i$, where 0 indicates
the control or standard treatment, and 1 indicates the experimental
treatment. We currently only allow for two levels of treatment and
assume that the treatment assignments are randomized. Let $S_i$ be the
observed value of the intermediate response for subject $i$. Since $S_i$
can be affected by treatment, there are two naturally occurring
counterfactual values of $S_i$: $S_i(1)$ under treatment, and $S_i(0)$
under control. Let $s_z$ be the realization of the random variable
$S(z)$, for $z \in \{0, 1\}$. The outcome of interest is denoted $Y_i$.
We consider the counterfactual values of $Y_i(0)$ and $Y_i(1)$. We allow
for continous, binary, count, and time-to-event outcomes, thus $Y_i$ may
be a vector containing a time variable and an event/censoring indicator,
i.e. $Y_i = (T_i, \Delta_i)$ where $\Delta_i = 1$ if $T_i$ is an event
time, and $\Delta_i = 0$ if $T_i$ is a censoring time. In event driven
settings, $S_i(z)$ is only defined if the event, $Y_i(z)$, does not
occur before the potential surrogate $S_i(z)$ is measured at a fixed
time $\tau$ after entry into the study. The data analyses only include
participants who have not experienced the event outcome by time $\tau$.

## Estimands

Criteria for $S$ to be a good surrogate are based on risk estimands that
condition on the potential intermediate responses. The risk is defined
as a mapping $g$ of the cumulative distribution function of $Y(z)$
conditional on the intermediate responses. The joint risk estimands
conditions on the candidate surrogate under both level of treatment,
$(S(1), S(0))$.
$$risk_1(s_1, s_0) = g\left\{F_{s_1}\left[Y(1) | S(0) = s_0, S(1) = s_1\right]\right\},$$

$$risk_0(s_1, s_0) = g\left\{F_{s_1}\left[Y(0) | S(0) = s_0, S(1) = s_1\right]\right\}.$$

For instance, for a binary outcome, the risk function may simply be the
probability $risk_z(s_1, s_0) = P(Y(z) = 1 | S(0) = s_0, S(1) = s_1)$,
or for a time-to-event outcome the risk function may be the cumulative
distribution function
$risk_z(s_1, s_0) = P(Y(z) \leq t | S(0) = s_0, S(1) = s_1)$.

Currently we focus only on marginal risk estimands which condition only
on $S(1)$, the intermediate response or biomarker under active
treatment:
$$risk_1(s_1) = g\left\{F_{s_1}\left[Y(1) | S(1) = s_1\right]\right\},$$

$$risk_0(s_1) = g\left\{F_{s_1}\left[Y(0) | S(1) = s_1\right]\right\}.$$

Neither of the joint risk estimands are indentifiable in a standard
randomized trial, as either $S(0)$ or $S(1)$ or both will be missing for
each subject. In the special case where $S(0)$ is constant, such as the
immune response to HIV antigens or Hep B in the placebo arm of a vaccine
trial, the joint and marginal risk estimands are equivalent. This
special case is referred to as case constant biomarker (CB) in much of
the literature [@Gilbert08]; i.e., $S_i(0) = c$ for subjects $i$. This
may occur outside the vaccine setting when one considers the AUC of a
treament drug as a surrogate; those recieving placebo will have no drug
and therefore all placebo AUC will be 0 or undefined. Under assumptions
given below, and in the case CB setting, the marginal risk estimand is
indentifiable in the treatment arm; it is not indentifiable in the
control arm without further assumptions or trial agumentation
[@Wolfson10].

There are specific trial augmentations that allow for the measurement or
imputation of the missing counterfactual $S$s, in the control and
treament arms. As well, Under one of these augmentations case CB can
sometimes be induced by considering a function of the a candidate
surrogate for evaluation. Greater detail on this point given below.

Specification of the distributions of $Y(z) | S(1)$ determines the
likelihood, we will denote this as $f(y | \beta, s_1, z)$. If $S(1)$
were fully observed, simple maximum likelihood estimation could be used.
The key challenge in estimating these risk estimands is solving the
problem of conditioning on counterfactual values that are not observable
for at least a subset of subjects in a randomized trial. This involves
integrating out missing values based on some model, and under some set
of assumptions and/or trial augmentations.

## Prinicipal surrogate criteria

@Frangakis02 gave a single criterion for a biomarker S to be a PS:
causal effects of the treatment on the clinical outcome only exist when
causal effects of the treatment on the intermediate variable exist. In
general this can only be evaluated using the joint risk estimands, which
consider not only the counterfactual values of the biomarker under
treatment, but also under control $S(0)$. However, in the special case
where all $S(0)$ values are constant, say at level $C$, such as an
immune response to HIV in a HIV negative population pre-vaccination this
criteria, often referred to as average causal necessity (ACN), can by
written in terms of the marginal risk estimands as:
$$risk_1(C)=risk_0(C).$$

More recently, other works @Gilbert08, @Wolfson10, @Huang11, @Huang12,
@Gabriel14, and @Gabriel15b have suggested that this criterion is both
too restrictive and in some cases can be vacuously true. Instead most
current works suggest that the wide effect modification (WEM) criterion
is of primary importance, ACN being of secondary importance. WEM is
given formally in terms of the risk estimands and a known contrast
function $h$ satisfying $h(x, y) = 0$ if and only if $x = y$ by:
$$|h(risk_1(s_1),risk_0(s_1)) - h(risk_1(s{_1}^*),risk_0(s{_1}^*))|>\delta,$$
for at least some $s_1 \neq s_{1}^*$ and $\delta>0$, with the larger the
$\delta$ the better the surrogate. Examples of contrast functions are
the treatment efficacy, $h(x, y) = 1 - x/y$, and the risk difference
$h(x, y) = x - y$. To evaluate WEM and ACN we need to identify the risk
estimands, which condition on data that is missing for at least half of
the subjects in a standard randomized trial.

## Augmentation and assumptions

We first make three standard assumptions used in much of the literature
for absorbing events outcomes:

-   Stable Unit Treatment Value Assumption (SUTVA): Observations on the
    independent units in the trial should be unaffected by the treatment
    assignment of other units.

-   Ignorable Treatment Assignment: The observed treatment assignment
    does not change the counterfactual clinical outcome.

-   Equal individual risk up to the time of candidate surrogate
    measurement $\tau$.

In time-to-event settings one more assumption is needed:

-   Non-informative censoring.

It should be noted that the equal individual risk assumption requires
that time-to-event analysis start at time $\tau$, rather than at
randomization.

@Wolfson10 outlines how these assumptions are needed for identification
of the risk estimands. Now to deal with the missing $S(1)$ values among
those with $Z = 0$, we next focus on three trial augmentations: Baseline
immunogenicity predictor (BIP), closeout placebo vaccination (CPV), a
concept that was extend to the setting of general treatment trials under
the name of closeout control treatment (CCT) in @Gabriel15b, and
baseline surrogate measurement (BSM). For further details on these
augmentations, we refer you to @Follmann06, @Gilbert08, @Gabriel14, and
for further augmenations not yet implemented to @Gabriel15b.

### BIP

Briefly, a BIP $W$ is any baseline measurement or set of measurements
that is highly correlated with $S$. It is particularly useful if $W$ is
unlikely to be associated with the clinical outcome after conditioning
on $S$, i.e. $Y \perp W | S(1)$; some of the methods leverage this
assumption. The BIP $W$ is used to integrate out the missing $S(1)$
among those with $Z = 0$ based on a model for $S(1) | W$ that is
estimated among those with $Z = 1$. We describe how this model is used
in the next section.

The assumptions needed for a BIP to be useful depend on the risk model
used. If the BIP is included in the risk model, only the assumption of
no interaction with treatment and the candidate surrogate are needed.
However, if the BIP is not included in the risk model, the assumption
that that clinical outcome is independent of the BIP given the candidate
surrogate is needed. Although not a requirement for identification of
the risk estimands, it has been found in most simulations studies that a
correlation between the BIP and $S(1)$ of greater than 0.7 is needed for
unbiased estimation in finite samples.

### CPV or CCT

Under a CPV or CCT augmented design, control recipients that do not have
events, or all willing control subjects for a non-event driven clinical
outcome, are given the experimental treatment at the end of the
follow-up period. Then, their intermediate response is measured at some
time after that treatment. This measurement is then used as a direct
imputation for the missing $S(1)$. The CPV augmentation was developed in
the setting of vaccine trials, where the surrogate is an immune response
and the outcome is infection. One set of conservative assumptions to use
CPV as a direct imputation for $S(1)$ in a vaccine trial are given in
@Wolfson10 are:

-   Individual time constancy of the true intermediate response under
    active treatment, $S(1)=S_{CPV}$ almost surely, for placebo
    recipients that are crossed over at the end of the trial, where
    $S_{CPV}$ is the measurement of the candidate surrogate after
    crossover treatment of the placebo subjects.

-   No events (infections) during the close-out period.

In the general treatment trial setting, the CCT augmentation can be used
under the same Individual time constancy assumption, and the assumption
that drop-out or unwillingness to receive close-out treatment is
completely at random.

### BSM

@Gabriel14 suggested the baseline augmentation BSM, which is a
pre-treatment measurement of the candidate PS, denoted $S_B$. The BSM
may be a good predictor of $S(1)$ without any further assumptions. It
can be used in the same way as a BIP. Alternatively you can transform
$S(1) - S_B$ and use this as the candidate surrogate, further increasing
the association with the BSM/BIP. Under the BSM assumption outlined in
@Gabriel14;

-   Time constancy of the true intermediate response under control,

then $S(0)=S_{BSM}$ almost surely. You do not need this assumption to
use a BSM, but if it holds then it induces the CB case, thus the joint
and marginal risk estimands are equivalent.

## Risk estimation

### Estimated maximum likelihood

Let $f(y | \beta, s_1, z)$ denote the density of $Y | S(1), Z$ with
parameters $\beta$. Further let $R_i$ denote the indicator for
missingness in $S_i(1)$. We proceed to estimate $\beta$ by maximizing
$$\prod_{i = 1}^n \left\{f(Y_i | \beta, S_i(1), Z_i)\right\}^R_i \left\{\int f(Y_i | \beta, s, Z_i) \, d \hat{F}_{S(1) | W}(s | W_i)\right\}^{1 - R_i}$$
with respect to $\beta$.

This procedure is called estimated maximum likelihood (EML) and was
developed in @Pepe91. The key idea is that we are averaging the
likelihood contributions for subjects missing $S(1)$ with respect to the
estimated distribution of $S(1) | W$, denoted by
$\hat{F}_{S(1) | W}(s | W_i)$. The model for this distribution is
referred to as the integration model. Recall that a BIP $W$ that is
strongly associated with $S(1)$ is needed for adequate performance.

Closed-form inference is not available for EML estimates, thus we
recommend use of the bootstrap for estimation of standard errors. It was
suggested as an approach to principal surrogate evaluation by @Gilbert08
and @Huang11.

### Pseudoscore

@Huang12 suggest a different estimation procedure that does have a
closed form variance estimator. Instead of numerically optimizing the
estimated likelihood, the pseudoscore approach iteratively finds the
solution to weighted versions of the score equations. Pseudoscore
estimates were also suggested in @WolfsonDiss and implemented for
several special cases in @Huang12. We have implemented here only one of
the special cases: categorical $BIP$ and binary $Y$ ($S$ may be
continuous or categorical). In addition to having closed form variance
estimators, it has been argued that the pseudo-score estimators are more
efficient than the EML estimators. The closed form variance estimates
are not yet implemented.

## Package features

Typically, users would have to code up the likelihood, integration
model, and perform the optimization themselves. This is beyond the reach
of many researchers who desire to use these methods. The goal of
*pseval* is to correctly implement these methods with a flexible and
user-friendly interface, enabling researchers to implement and interpret
a wide variety of models.

The *pseval* package allows users to specify the type of augmented
design that is used in their study, specify the form of the risk model
along with the distribution of $Y | S(1)$, and specify different
integration models to estimate the distribution of $S(1) | W$. Then the
likelihood can be maximized and bootstraps run. Post-estimation
summaries are available to display and analyze the treatment efficacy as
a function of $S(1)$. All of this is implemented with a flexible and
familiar interface.

# Package information

## Usage

Here we will walk through some basic analyses from the point of view of
a new R user. Along the way we will highlight the main features of
*pseval*. We support binary, continuous, count, and time-to-event
outcomes, thus we will also need to load the
[*survival*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=survival) package
[@survival-sachs; @survivalb].

### Example dataset

First let's create an example dataset. The *pseval* package provides the
function `generate_example_data` which takes a single argument: the
sample size.

``` r
set.seed(1492)
fakedata <- generate_example_data(n = 800)
head(fakedata)
```

``` r
##   Z        BIP       CPV         BSM       S.obs  time.obs

## 1         0     0 (-0.198,0.503]  (0.0574,0.766]
## 2         1     0    (1.36, Inf]    (0.766, Inf]
## 3         1     1  (-Inf,-0.198]   (-Inf,-0.678]
## 4         1     0 (-0.198,0.503] (-0.678,0.0574]
## 5         1     1 (-0.198,0.503] (-0.678,0.0574]
## 6         1     0  (-Inf,-0.198]   (-Inf,-0.678]
```

The example data includes both a time-to-event outcome, a binary
outcome, a surrogate, a BIP, CPV, and BSM, and a categorical version of
the surrogate. The true model for the time is exponential, with
parameters (intercept) = -1, S(1) = 0.0, Z = 0.0, S(1):Z = -0.75. The
true model for binary is logistic, with the same parameter values.

In the above table S.obs.cat and BIP.cat are formed as
`S.obs.catÂ <-Â factor(S.obs,levels=c(-Inf,Â quantile(c(S.0,Â S.1),Â c(.25,Â .5,Â .75),Â na.rmÂ =Â TRUE),Â Inf))`
and similarly for BIP.cat. Alternatively a user could input arbitrary
numeric values to represent different discrete subgroups (e.g., 0s and
1s to denote 2 subgroups).

### The `"psdesign"` object

We begin by creating a `"psdesign"` object with the synonymous function.
This is the object that combines the raw dataset with information about
the study design and the structure of the data. Subsequent analysis will
operate on this psdesign object. It is designed to be analogous to the
`svydesign` function in the
[*survey*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=survey) package
[@survey; @surveya]. The first argument is the data frame where the data
are stored. All subsequent arguments describe the mappings from the
variable names in the data frame to important variables in the PS
analysis, using the same notation as above. Other covariates or
variables can be mapped to arbitrary variable names using the same
syntax. An optional weights argument describes the sampling weights, if
present. Our first analysis will use the binary version of the outcome,
with continuous $S.1$ and the BIP labeled $BIP$. The object has a print
method, so we can inspect the result.

``` r
binary.ps <- psdesign(data = fakedata, Z = Z, Y = Y.obs, S = S.obs, BIP = BIP)
binary.ps
```

``` r
## Augmented data frame:  800  obs. by  6  variables.

##  No bootstraps present, see ?ps_bootstrap.
```

The printout displays a brief description of the data, including the
empirical treatment efficacy estimate, the variables used in the
analysis and their corresponding variables in the original dataset.
Finally the printout invites the user to see the help page for
`add_integration`, in order to add an integration model to the psdesign
object, the next step in the analysis.

Missing values in the $S$ variable are allowed. Note that any cases
where $S(1)$ is missing will be integrated over in the likelihood or
score equations. Thus any cases that experienced an event prior to the
time $\tau$ when the surrogate was measured should be excluded from the
dataset. The equal individual risk assumption allows us to make causal
inferences even after excluding such cases.

`psdesign` easily accommodates case-control or case-cohort sampling. In
this case, the surrogate $S$ is only measured on a subset of the data,
inducing missingness in $S$ by design. Let's modify the fake dataset to
see how it works. We're going to sample all of the cases, and 20% of the
controls for measurement of $S$.

``` r
fakedata.cc <- fakedata
missdex <- sample((1:nrow(fakedata.cc))[fakedata.cc$Y.obs == 0], 
       size = floor(sum(fakedata.cc$Y.obs == 0) * .8))
fakedata.cc[missdex, ]$S.obs <- NA
fakedata.cc$weights <- ifelse(fakedata.cc$Y.obs == 1, 1, .2)
```

Now we can create the `"psdesign"` object, using the entire dataset
(including those missing `S.obs`) and passing the weights to the
`weights` field.

``` r
binary.cc <- psdesign(data = fakedata.cc, Z = Z, Y = Y.obs, S = S.obs, 
                      BIP = BIP, weights = weights)
```

The other augmentation types can be defined by mapping variables to the
names `BIP`, `CPV`, and/or `BSM`. The augmentations are handled as
described in the previous section: CPV is used as a direct imputation
for $S(1)$, and BSM is used as a direct imputation for $S(0)$. BIPs and
BSMs are made available in the augmented dataset for use in the
integration models which we describe in the next subsection.

For survival outcomes, a key assumption is that the potential surrogate
is measured at a fixed time $\tau$ after entry into the study. Any
subjects who have a clinical outcome prior to $\tau$ will be removed
from the analysis, with a warning. If `tau` is not specified in the
`psdesign` object, then it is assumed to be 0. Survival outcomes are
specified by mapping `Y` to a `Surv` object, which requires the
*survival* package:

``` r
surv.ps <- psdesign(data = fakedata, Z = Z, Y = Surv(time.obs, event.obs), S = S.obs, 
                        BIP = BIP, CPV = CPV, BSM = BSM)
```

``` r
## Warning in psdesign(data = fakedata, Z = Z, Y = Surv(time.obs,
## event.obs), : tau missing in psdesign: assuming that the
## surrogate S was measured at time 0.
```

### Integration models

The EML procedure requires an estimate of $F_{S(1) | W}$, and we refer
to this as the integration model. Details are available in the help page
for `add_integration`. Several integration models are implemented,
including a parametric model that uses a formula interface to define a
regression model, a semiparametric model that specifies a location and a
scale model is robust to the specification of the distribution, and a
non-parametric model that uses empirical conditional probability
estimates for discrete $W$ and $S(1)$.

For this first example, let's use the parametric integration model. We
specify the mean model for $S(1) | W$ as a formula. The predictor is
generally a function of the BIP and the BSM, if available. We can add
the integration model directly to the psdesign object and inspect the
results. Note that in the formula, we refer to the variable names in the
augmented dataset.

``` r
binary.ps <- binary.ps + integrate_parametric(S.1 ~ BIP)
binary.ps
```

``` r
## Augmented data frame:  800  obs. by  6  variables.

## 5 0 1  NA -0.1847          1 -0.235

##

##

## 
## Risk models: 
##  None present, see ?add_riskmodel for information on risk models.
##  No estimates present, see ?ps_estimate.
##  No bootstraps present, see ?ps_bootstrap.
```

We can add multiple integration models to a psdesign object, say we want
a model for $S(0) | W$:

``` r
binary.ps + integrate_parametric(S.0 ~ BIP)
```

``` r

```

In a future version of the package, we will allow for estimation of the
joint risk estimands that depend on both $S(0)$ and $S(1)$. We can also
use splines, other transformations, and other variables in the formula:

``` r
library(splines)
binary.ps + integrate_parametric(S.1 ~ BIP^2)
binary.ps + integrate_parametric(S.1 ~ bs(BIP, df = 3))
binary.ps + integrate_parametric(S.1 ~ BIP + BSM + BSM^2)
```

To include additional baseline covariates in the model for $S(1)$, such
as age or gender, these variables that are present in the data frame
must be mapped in the `psdesign` function call so that they are visible
in the subsequent functions:

``` r
binary.ps <- psdesign(data = fakedata, Z = Z, Y = Y.obs, S = S.obs, BIP = BIP, 
                      BSM = BSM, age = age)
binary.ps + integrate_parametric(S.1 ~ BIP + age)
```

These are shown as examples, we will proceed with the simple linear
model for integration. The other integration models are called
`integrate_bivnorm`, `integrate_nonparametric`, and\
`integrate_semiparametric`. See their help files for details on the
models and their specification.

The next step is to define the risk model.

### Risk models and likelihoods

The risk model is the specification of the distribution for the outcome
$Y$ given $S(1)$ and $Z$. We accommodate a variety of flexible
specifications for this model, for continous, binary, time-to-event, and
count outcomes. We have implemented exponential and weibull survival
models, and a flexible specification for binary models, allowing for
standard or custom link functions. See the help file for `add_riskmodel`
for more details.

Let's add a simple binary risk model using the logit link. The argument
`D` specifies the number of samples to use for the simulated annealing,
also known as empirical integration, in the EML procedure. In general, D
should be set to something reasonably large, like 2 or 3 times the
sample size.

``` r
binary.ps <- binary.ps + risk_binary(model = Y ~ S.1 * Z, D = 50, risk = risk.logit)
binary.ps
```

### Estimation and bootstrap

We estimate the parameters and bootstrap using the same type of syntax.
We can add a `"ps_estimate"` object, which takes optional arguments
`start` for starting values, and other arguments that are passed to the
`optim` function in base R. The `method` argument determines the
optimization method, we have found that "BFGS" works well in these types
of problems and it is the default. Use `"pseudo-score"` as the `method`
argument for pseudo-score estimation for binary risk models with
categorical BIPs.

The `ps_bootstrap` function takes the additional arguments `n.boots` for
the number of bootstrap replicates, and `progress.bar` which is a
logical that displays a progress bar in the R console if true. It is
helpful to pass the estimates as starting values in the bootstrap
resampling. With estimates and bootstrap replicates present, printing
the psdesign object displays additional information.

``` r
binary.est <- binary.ps + ps_estimate(method = "BFGS")
binary.boot <- binary.est + ps_bootstrap(n.boots = 500, progress.bar = FALSE, 
                            start = binary.est$estimates$par, method = "BFGS")
binary.boot
```

### Do it all at once

The next code chunk shows how the model can be defined and estimated all
at once.

``` r
binary.est <- psdesign(data = fakedata, Z = Z, Y = Y.obs, S = S.obs, BIP = BIP) + 
  integrate_parametric(S.1 ~ BIP) + 
  risk_binary(model = Y ~ S.1 * Z, D = 50, risk = risk.logit) + 
  ps_estimate(method = "BFGS")
```

### Plots and summaries

We provide summary and plotting methods for the psdesign object. If
bootstrap replicates are present, the summary method does a test for
wide effect modification. Under the parametric risk models implemented
in this package, the test for wide effect modification is equivalent to
a test of the null hypothesis that the $S(1):Z$ coefficient is equal to
0. This is implemented using a Wald test using the bootstrap estimate of
the variance.

Another way to assess wide effect modification is to compute the
standardized total gain (STG) [@Huang11] and [@Gabriel15]. This is
implemented in the `calc_STG` function. The standardized total gain can
be interpreted as the area sandwiched between the risk difference curve
and the horizontal line at the marginal risk difference. It is a measure
of the spread of the distribution of the risk difference, and is a less
parametric way to test for wide effect modification. The `calc_STG`
function computes the STG at the estimated parameters and at the
bootstrap samples, if present. The function prints the results and
invisibly returns a list containing the observed STG, and the
bootstrapped STGS.

``` r
calc_STG(binary.boot, progress.bar = FALSE)
```

``` r
## $obsSTG
## [1] 0.3397774
## 
## $bootstraps
##    STG.boot.se STG.lower.CL.2.5 STG.upper.CL.97.5
## V1   0.1243311        0.1573031         0.6382418
```

The summary method also computes the marginal treatment efficacy
marginalized over $S(1)$ and compares it to the average treatment
efficacy conditional on $S(1)$. This is an assessment of model fit. A
warning will be given if the two estimates are dramatically different.
These estimates are presented in the summary along with the empirical TE
and the model-based marginal treatment efficacy that does not condition
on S(1).

``` r
smary <- summary(binary.boot)
```

The `calc_risk` function computes the risk in each treatment arm, and
contrasts of the risks. By default it computes the treatment efficacy,
but there are other contrast functions available. The contrast function
is a function that takes 2 inputs, the $risk_0$ and $risk_1$, and
returns some one dimensional function of those two inputs. It must be
vectorized. Some built-in functions are "TE" for treatment efficacy
$= 1 - risk_1(s)/risk_0(s)$, "RR" for relative risk
$= risk_1(s)/risk_0(s)$, "logRR" for log of the relative risk, and "RD"
for the risk difference $= risk_1(s) -risk_0(s)$. You can pass the name
of the function, or the function itself to `calc_risk`. See `?calc_risk`
for more information about contrast functions.

Other arguments of the `calc_risk` function include `t`, the time at
which to calculate the risk for time-to-event outcomes, `n.samps` which
is the number of samples over the range of S.1 at which the risk will be
calculated, and `CI.type`, which can be set to `"pointwise"` for
pointwise confidence intervals or `"band"` for a simultaneous confidence
band. `sig.level` is the significance level for the bootstrap confidence
intervals. If the outcome is time-to-event and $t$ is not present, then
it will use the restricted mean survival time.

It is easy to plot the risk estimates. By default, the plot method
displays the TE contrast, but this can be changed using the same syntax
as in `calc_risk`.

``` r
plot(binary.boot, contrast = "TE", lwd = 2)
abline(h = smary$TE.estimates[2], lty = 3)

expit <- function(x) exp(x)/(1 + exp(x))
trueTE <- function(s){
  
  r0 <- expit(-1 - 0 * s)
  r1 <- expit(-1 - 1.25 * s)
  1 - r1/r0
  
}

rug(binary.boot$augdata$S.1)
curve(trueTE(x), add = TRUE, col = "red")
legend("bottomright", legend = c("estimated TE", "95\\% CB", 
                                  "marginal TE", "true TE"), 
       col = c("black", "black", "black", "red"), 
       lty = c(1, 2, 3, 1), lwd = c(2, 2, 1, 1))
```

![Figure 1: Plot showing the estimates using the example data, along
with confidence bands (CB), and the true treatment efficacy (TE)
curve.](figure/plot1-1.png){width="100%" alt="graphic without alt text"}

By default, plots of psdesign objects with bootstrap samples will
display simultaneous confidence bands for the curve. These bands
$L\alpha$ satisfy

$$P\left\{\sup_{s \in B} | \hat{TE}(s) - TE(s) | \leq L_\alpha \right\} \leq 1 - \alpha,$$

for confidence level $\alpha$. The alternative is to use pointwise
confidence intervals, with the option `CI.typeÂ =Â "pointwise"`. These
intervals satisfy

$$P\left\{\hat{L}_\alpha \leq TE(s) \leq \hat{U}_\alpha\right\} \leq 1 - \alpha, \mbox{ for all } s.$$

Different summary measures are available for plotting. The options are
"TE" for treatment efficacy = $1 - risk_1(s)/risk_0(s)$, "RR" for
relative risk = $risk_1(s)/risk_0(s)$, "logRR" for log of the relative
risk, "risk" for the risk in each treatment arm, and "RD" for the risk
difference = $risk_1(s) - risk_0(s)$. We can also transform using the
`log` option of `plot`.

``` r
plot(binary.boot, contrast = "logRR", lwd = 2, 
      col = c("black", "grey75", "grey75"))
plot(binary.boot, contrast = "RR", log = "y", lwd = 2, 
      col = c("black", "grey75", "grey75"))
plot(binary.boot, contrast = "RD", lwd = 2, 
      col = c("black", "grey75", "grey75"))
plot(binary.boot, contrast = "risk", lwd = 2, lty = c(1, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0))
legend("topright", legend = c("R0", "R1"), lty = c(1, 2), lwd = 2)
```

functions can be plotted.](figure/logrr-1.png){width="100%" alt="graphic without alt text"}

The `calc_risk` function is the workhorse that creates the plots. You
can call this function directly to obtain estimates, standard errors,
and confidence intervals for the estimated risk in each treatment arm
and transformations of the risk like TE. The parameter `n.samps`
determines the number of points at which to calculate the risk. The
points are evenly spaced over the range of S.1. Use this function to
compute other summaries, make plots using
[*ggplot2*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=ggplot2) [@ggplot2-sachs]
or [*lattice*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=lattice) [@lattice]
and more.

# Summary and conclusion

We have implemented the core methods for principal surrogate evaluation
in our *pseval* package. Our aim was to create a flexible and consistent
user interface that allows for the estimation of a wide variety of
statistical models in this framework. There has been some other work in
this area. The
[*Surrogate*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=Surrogate) package
implements the core methods for the evaluation of trial-level surrogates
using a meta-analytic framework. It also has a wide variety of models,
each implemented in a different function each with a long list of
parameters [@surrogate].

Our package uses the `+` sign to combine function calls into a single
object. This is called "overloading the `+` operator" and is most
famously known from the *ggplot2* package. Conceptually, this was
appealing to us because it allows users to build up analysis objects
starting from the design, and ending with the estimation. The distinct
analysis concepts of the design, risk model specification, integration
model, and estimation/bootstrap approaches are separated into distinct
function calls, each with a limited number of parameters. This makes it
easier for users to keep track of their models, makes it easier to
understand the methods involved, and allows for the specification of a
wide variety of models by mixing and matching the function calls. This
framework will also make it easier to maintain the codebase, and to
extend it in the future as the methods evolve. Our package is useful for
novice and expert R users alike, and implements an important set of
statistical methods for the first time.

## Additional examples

### Plot both types of CI

``` r
plot(binary.boot, contrast = "TE", lwd = 2, CI.type = "band")
sbs <- calc_risk(binary.boot, CI.type = "pointwise", n.samps = 200)
lines(Y.lower.CL.2.5 ~ S.1, data = sbs, lty = 3, lwd = 2)
lines(Y.upper.CL.97.5 ~ S.1, data = sbs, lty = 3, lwd = 2)
legend("bottomright", lwd = 2, lty = 1:3, 
       legend = c("estimate", "simultaneous CI", "pointwise CI"))
```

### Plot with ggplot2

``` r
library(ggplot2)
TE.est <- calc_risk(binary.boot, n.samps = 200)
ggplot(TE.est, 
       aes(x = S.1, y = Y, ymin = Y.lower.CL.0.95, ymax = Y.upper.CL.0.95)) + 
  geom_line() + geom_ribbon(alpha = .2) + ylab(attr(TE.est, "Y.function"))
```

### Case-control design

``` r
cc.fit <- binary.cc + integrate_parametric(S.1 ~ BIP) + 
  risk_binary(D = 10) + ps_estimate()
cc.fit
```

### Survival outcome

``` r
surv.fit <- psdesign(fakedata, Z = Z, Y = Surv(time.obs, event.obs), 
                     S = S.obs, BIP = BIP, CPV = CPV) + 
  integrate_semiparametric(formula.location = S.1 ~ BIP, formula.scale = S.1 ~ 1) + 
  risk_exponential(D = 10) + ps_estimate(method = "BFGS") + ps_bootstrap(n.boots = 20)
surv.fit
plot(surv.fit)
```

### Continuous outcome

``` r
fakedata$Y.cont <- log(fakedata$time.obs + 0.01)
cont.fit <- psdesign(fakedata, Z = Z, Y = Y.cont, 
                     S = S.obs, BIP = BIP, CPV = CPV) + 
  integrate_semiparametric(formula.location = S.1 ~ BIP, formula.scale = S.1 ~ 1) + 
  risk_continuous(D = 10) + ps_estimate(method = "BFGS") + ps_bootstrap(n.boots = 20)
cont.fit
plot(cont.fit, contrast = "risk")
```

### Categorical S

`S.obs.cat` and `BIP.cat` are factors:

``` r
with(fakedata, table(S.obs.cat, BIP.cat))
```

``` r
cat.fit <- psdesign(fakedata, Z = Z, Y = Y.obs, 
                     S = S.obs.cat, BIP = BIP.cat) + 
  integrate_nonparametric(formula = S.1 ~ BIP) + 
  risk_binary(Y ~ S.1 * Z, D = 10, risk = risk.probit) + ps_estimate(method = "BFGS")
cat.fit
plot(cat.fit)
```

### Pseudo-score

Categorical W allows for estimation of the model using the pseudo-score
method for binary outcomes. $S$ may be continuous or categorical:

``` r
cat.fit.ps <- psdesign(fakedata, Z = Z, Y = Y.obs, 
                     S = S.obs, BIP = BIP.cat) + 
  integrate_nonparametric(formula = S.1 ~ BIP) + 
  risk_binary(Y ~ S.1 * Z, D = 10, risk = risk.logit) + 
  ps_estimate(method = "pseudo-score") + 
  ps_bootstrap(n.boots = 20, method = "pseudo-score")
summary(cat.fit.ps)
plot(cat.fit.ps)
```
