title: An Introduction to Principal Surrogate Evaluation with the pseval Package
abstract: We describe a new package called pseval that implements the core methods
  for the evaluation of principal surrogates in a single clinical trial. It provides
  a flexible interface for defining models for the risk given treatment and the surrogate,
  the models for integration over the missing counterfactual surrogate responses,
  and the estimation methods. Estimated maximum likelihood and pseudo-score can be
  used for estimation, and the bootstrap for inference. A variety of post-estimation
  methods are provided, including print, summary, plot, and testing. We summarize
  the main statistical methods that are implemented in the package and illustrate
  its use from the perspective of a novice R user.
