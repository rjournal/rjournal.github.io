title: 'hdm: High-Dimensional Metrics'
abstract: In this article the package High-dimensional Metrics hdm is introduced.
  It is a collection of statistical methods for estimation and quantification of uncertainty
  in high-dimensional approximately sparse models. It focuses on providing confidence
  intervals and significance testing for (possibly many) low-dimensional subcomponents
  of the high-dimensional parameter vector. Efficient estimators and uniformly valid
  confidence intervals for regression coefficients on target variables (e.g., treatment
  or policy variable) in a high-dimensional approximately sparse regression model,
  for average treatment effect (ATE) and average treatment effect for the treated
  (ATET), as well for extensions of these param eters to the endogenous setting are
  provided. Theory grounded, data-driven methods for selecting the penalization parameter
  in Lasso regressions under heteroscedastic and non-Gaussian errors are implemented.
  Moreover, joint/ simultaneous confidence intervals for regression coefficients of
  a high-dimensional sparse regression are implemented. Data sets which have been
  used in the literature and might be useful for classroom demonstration and for testing
  new estimators are included.
