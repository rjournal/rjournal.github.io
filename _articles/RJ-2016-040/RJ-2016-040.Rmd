abstract: In this article the package High-dimensional Metrics *hdm* is introduced.
  It is a collection of statistical methods for estimation and quantification of uncertainty
  in high-dimensional approximately sparse models. It focuses on providing confidence
  intervals and significance testing for (possibly many) low-dimensional subcomponents
  of the high-dimensional parameter vector. Efficient estimators and uniformly valid
  confidence intervals for regression coefficients on target variables (e.g., treatment
  or policy variable) in a high-dimensional approximately sparse regression model,

  provided. Theory grounded, data-driven methods for selecting the penalization parameter
  in Lasso regressions under heteroscedastic and non-Gaussian errors are implemented.
  Moreover, joint/ simultaneous confidence intervals for regression coefficients of
  a high-dimensional sparse regression are implemented. Data sets which have been
  used in the literature and might be useful for classroom demonstration and for testing
  new estimators are included.

# Introduction

Analysis of high-dimensional models, models in which the number of
parameters to be estimated is large relative to the sample size, is
becoming increasingly important. Such models arise naturally in readily
available high-dimensional data which have many measured characteristics
available per individual observation as in, for example, large survey
data sets, scanner data, and text data. Such models also arise naturally
even in data with a small number of measured characteristics in
situations where the exact functional form with which the observed
variables enter the model is unknown, and we create many technical
variables, a dictionary, from the raw characteristics. Examples of this
scenario include semiparametric models with nonparametric nuisance
functions. More generally, models with many parameters relative to the
sample size often arise when attempting to model complex phenomena.

For R, many packages for estimation high-dimensional models are already
available. For example,
[*glmnet*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=glmnet) [@GLMNet] and
[*lars*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=lars) [@larspackage] are
popular for Lasso estimation. The section \"Regularized & Shrinkage
Methods\" in the task view on \"Machine Learning and Statistical
Learning\" contains further implementation of Lasso and related methods.

The methods which are implemented in this package
([*hdm*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=hdm)) are chiefly distinct
from already available methods in other packages in offering the
following four major features:

-   First, we provide a version of Lasso regression that expressly
    handles and allows for non-Gaussian and heteroscedastic errors.

-   Second, we implement a theoretically grounded, data-driven choice of
    the penalty level $\lambda$ in the Lasso regressions. To underscore
    this choice, we call the Lasso implementation in this package
    "rigorous"Â Lasso (=`rlasso`). The prefix `r` in function names
    should underscore this. In high-dimensional settings
    cross-validation is very popular; but it lacks a theoretical
    justification for use in the present context and some theoretical
    proposals for the choice of $\lambda$ are often not feasible.
    Moreover, the theoretically grounded, data-driven choice makes
    cross-validation redundant, as it is time-consuming particularly in
    large data sets.

-   Third, we provide efficient estimators and uniformly valid
    confidence intervals for various low-dimensional causal/structural
    parameters appearing in high-dimensional approximately sparse
    models.[^1] For example, we provide efficient estimators and
    uniformly valid confidence intervals for a regression coefficient on
    a target variable (e.g., a treatment or policy variable) in a
    high-dimensional sparse regression model. Target variable in this
    context means the object not interest, e.g. a prespecified
    regression coefficient. We also provide estimates and confidence
    intervals for average treatment effect (ATE) and average treatment
    effect for the treated (ATET), as well extensions of these
    parameters to the endogenous setting.

-   Fourth, joint/ simultaneous confidence intervals for estimated
    coefficients in a high-dimensional approximately sparse models are
    provided, based on the methods and theory developed in [@BCK2014].
    They proposed uniformly valid confidence regions for regressions
    coefficients in a high-dimensional sparse Z-estimation problems,
    which include median, mean, and many other regression problems as
    special cases. In this article we apply this method to the
    coefficients of a Lasso regression and highlight this method with an
    empirical example.

In the following we will give a short overview over the functionality of
the package with simple examples. A detailed introduction on how to use
the functions is given in the accompanying vignette.

# A very short guide to the literature

In this section we give a very short introduction to the literature with
a focus on the methods which are implemented in the package.

Lasso under heteroscedastic and non-Gaussian errors was analysed in
@BCCH12. Post-Lasso, i.e. a least squares fit with the variables
selected by a Lasso regression, is introduced and analysed in
@BC-PostLASSO. Inference for a low-dimensional component of a
potentially high-dimensional vector has been conducted in
@BelloniChernozhukovHansen2011. @BelloniChernozhukovHansen2011 also
consider inference on average treatment effects in a heterogeneous
treatment effect setting after selection amongst high-dimensional
controls. Inference in high-dimensional settings is enabled by the
so-called orthogonality condition. The systematic development of the
orthogonality condition for inference on low-dimensional parameters in
high-dimensional settings is given in @CHS2015.

Instrumental variables estimation is a central topic in Econometrics and
also becoming more popular in fields such as Biostatistics,
Epidemiology, and Sociology. Good introductions to instrumental
variables and treatment effects are the books @AngristBook and
@ImbensRubin. The case of selection on high-dimensional instrumental
variables is given in @BCCH12, the case of selection on the instruments
and control variables in @CHS:ManyIVNote. For further discussion of
estimation of treatment effects in a high-dimensional setting including
cases with endogenous treatment assignment, we refer to @BCFH:Policy.

# Estimation of Lasso under heteroscedastic and non-Gaussian errors and inference for low-dimensional subcomponents

An important feature of our package is that it allows Lasso estimation
under heteroscedastic and non-Gaussian errors. This distinguishes the
package *hdm* from other already available software implementations of
Lasso. As an additional benefit, the theoretical grounded choice of the
penalty does not require cross-validation which might lead to a
considerable saving of computation time in many applications.

## Prediction in linear models using approximate sparsity

Consider high dimensional approximately sparse linear regression models.
These models have a large number of regressors $p$, possibly much larger
than the sample size $n$, but only a relatively small number $s =o(n)$
of these regressors are important for capturing accurately the main
features of the regression function. The latter assumption makes it
possible to estimate these models effectively by searching for
approximately the right set of regressors.

The model reads
$$y_i = x_i' \beta_0  + \varepsilon_i, \quad \mathbb{E}[\varepsilon_i x_i]=0, \quad \beta_0 \in \mathbb{R}^p, 
\quad i=1,\ldots,n$$
where $y_i$ are observations of the response variable,
$x_i=(x_{i,j}, \ldots, x_{i,p})$'s are observations of $p-$dimensional
regressors, and $\varepsilon_i$'s are centered disturbances, where
possibly $p \gg n$. Assume that the data sequence is i.i.d. for the sake
of exposition, although the framework covered is considerably more
general. An important point is that the errors $\varepsilon_i$ may be
non-Gaussian or heteroskedastic [@BCCH12].

The model can be exactly sparse, namely
$$\| \beta_0\|_0 \leq s = o(n),$$
or approximately sparse, namely that the values of coefficients, sorted
in decreasing order, $(| \beta_0|_{(j)})_{j=1}^p$ obey,
$$| \beta_0|_{(j)} \leq \mathsf{A} j^{-\mathsf{a}(\beta_0)},  \quad \mathsf{a}(\beta_0)>1/2, \quad j=1,...,p.$$
An approximately sparse model can be well-approximated by an exactly
sparse model with sparsity index
$$s \propto n^{1/(2 \mathsf{a}(\beta_0))}.$$

In order to get theoretically justified performance guarantees, we
consider the Lasso estimator with data-driven penalty loadings:
$$\hat \beta = \arg \min_{\beta \in  \mathbb{R}^p} \mathbb{E}_n [(y_i - x_i' \beta)^2] + \frac{\lambda}{n} ||\hat{\Psi} \beta||_1$$
where $||\beta||_1=\sum_{j=1}^p |\beta_j|$,
$\hat{\Psi}=\mathrm{diag}(\hat{\psi}_1,\ldots,\hat{\psi}_p)$ is a
diagonal matrix consisting of penalty loadings, and $\mathbb{E}_n$
abbreviates the empirical average. The penalty loadings are chosen to
insure basic equivariance of coefficient estimates to rescaling of
$x_{i,j}$ and can also be chosen to address heteroskedasticity in model
errors. We discuss the choice of $\lambda$ and $\hat \Psi$ below.

Regularization by the $\ell_1$-norm naturally helps the Lasso estimator
to avoid overfitting, but it also shrinks the fitted coefficients
towards zero, causing a potentially significant bias. In order to remove
some of this bias, consider the Post-Lasso estimator that applies
ordinary least squares to the model $\hat{T}$ selected by Lasso,
formally,
$$\hat{T} = \text{support}(\hat{\beta}) = \{ j \in \{ 1, \ldots,p\}: \lvert \hat{\beta} \rvert >0 \}.$$
The Post-Lasso estimate is then defined as
$$\tilde{\beta} \in \arg\min_{\beta \in \mathbb{R}^p}  \ \mathbb{E}_n \left( y_i - \sum_{j=1}^p x_{i,j} \beta_j \right) ^2: \beta_j=0 \quad \text{ if } \hat \beta_j = 0 , \quad \forall j.$$
In words, the estimator is ordinary least squares applied to the data
after removing the regressors that were not selected by Lasso. The
Post-Lasso estimator was introduced and analysed in @BC-PostLASSO.

A crucial matter is the choice of the penalization parameter $\lambda$.
With the right choice of the penalty level, Lasso and Post-Lasso
estimators possess excellent performance guarantees: They both achieve
the near-oracle rate for estimating the regression function, namely with
probability $1- \gamma - o(1)$,
$$\sqrt{\mathbb{E}_n [ (x_{i}'(\hat \beta - \beta_0))^2 ] } \lesssim \sqrt{(s/n) \log p}.$$

In high-dimensions setting, cross-validation is very popular in practice
but lacks theoretical justification and so may not provide such a
performance guarantee. In sharp contrast, the choice of the penalization
parameter $\lambda$ in the Lasso and Post-Lasso methods in this package
is theoretical grounded and feasible. Therefore we call the resulting
method the "rigorous"Lasso method and hence add a prefix **r** to the
function names.

[In the case of homoscedasticity]{.underline}, we set the penalty
loadings $\hat{\psi}_j = \sqrt{\mathbb{E}_n x_{i,j}^2}$, which insures
basic equivariance properties. There are two choices for penalty level
$\lambda$: the $X$-independent choice and $X$-dependent choice. In the
$X$-independent choice we set the penalty level to
$$\lambda = 2c \sqrt{n} \hat{\sigma} \Phi^{-1}(1-\gamma/(2p)),$$
where $\Phi$ denotes the cumulative standard normal distribution,
$\hat \sigma$ is a preliminary estimate of
$\sigma = \sqrt{\mathbb{E} \varepsilon^2}$, and $c$ is a theoretical
constant, which is set to $c=1.1$ by default for the Post-Lasso method
and $c=.5$ for the Lasso method, and $\gamma$ is the probability level,
which is set to $\gamma =.1$ by default. The parameter $\gamma$ can be
interpreted as the probability of mistakenly not removing $X$'s when all
of them have zero coefficients. In the X-dependent case the penalty
level is calculated as
$$\lambda = 2c \hat{\sigma} \Lambda(1-\gamma|X),$$
where
$$\Lambda(1-\gamma|X)=(1-\gamma)-\text{quantile of}\quad n||\mathbb{E}_n[x_i e_i] ||_{\infty}|X,$$
where $X=[x_1, \ldots, x_n]'$ and $e_i$ are iid $N(0,1)$, generated
independently from $X$; this quantity is approximated by simulation. The
$X$-independent penalty is more conservative than the $X$-dependent
penalty. In particular the $X$-dependent penalty automatically adapts to
highly correlated designs, using less aggressive penalization in this
case @BCH2011:InferenceGauss.

[In the case of heteroskedasticity]{.underline}, the loadings are set to
$\hat{\psi}_j=\sqrt{\mathbb{E}_n[x_{ij}^2 \hat \varepsilon_i^2]}$, where
$\hat \varepsilon_i$ are preliminary estimates of the errors. The
penalty level can be $X$-independent [@BCCH12]:
$$\lambda = 2c \sqrt{n} \Phi^{-1} (1-\gamma/(2p)),$$
or it can be X-dependent and estimated by a multiplier bootstrap
procedure [@CCK:AOS13]:
$$\lambda = c \times c_W(1-\gamma),$$
where $c_W(1-\gamma)$ is the $1-\gamma$-quantile of the random variable
$W$, conditional on the data, where
$$W:= n \max_{1 \leq j \leq p} |2\mathbb{E}_n [x_{ij} \hat{\varepsilon}_i e_i]|,$$
where $e_i$ are iid standard normal variables distributed independently
from the data, and $\hat{\varepsilon}_i$ denotes an estimate of the
residuals.

Estimation proceeds by iteration. The estimates of residuals
$\hat \varepsilon_i$ are initialized by running least squares of $y_i$
on five regressors that are most correlated to $y_i$. This implies
conservative starting values for $\lambda$ and the penalty loadings, and
leads to the initial Lasso and Post-Lasso estimates, which are then
further updated by iteration. The resulting iterative procedure is fully
justified in the theoretical literature.

## R implementation

The core of the package are the functions `rlasso` and `rlassoEffects`.
They allow estimation of a Lasso regression under heteroscedastic and
non-Gaussian errors and inference on a set of prespecified,
low-dimensional objects. As Lasso regression introduces shrinkage bias,
a post-Lasso option, which can be described as Lasso estimation followed
by a final refit with ols including only the selected variables, is
available.

The function `rlasso` implements Lasso and post-Lasso. The default
option is to use post-Lasso, `post=TRUE`. The user can also decide if an
unpenalized `intercept` should be included (`TRUE` by default),
`LassoShooting.fit` contains the computational algorithm that underlies
the estimation procedure. This function implements a version of the
Shooting Lasso Algorithm [@Fu1998]. The option `penalty` of the function
`rlasso` allows different choices for the penalization parameter and
loadings. It allows for homoscedastic or heteroscedastic errors with
default `homoscedastic = FALSE`. Moreover, the dependence structure of
the design matrix might be taken into consideration for calculation of
the penalization parameter with `X.dependent.lambda = TRUE`. With the
option `lambda.start` initial values for the algorithm can be set.[^2]

The option `penalty` allows to set the constants $c$ and $\gamma$ which
are necessary for the calculation of the penalty. For a detailed
description how the penalty and variable loadings are calculated, we
refer to the accompanying vignette. The maximum number of iterations and
the tolerance when the algorithms should stop can be set with `control`.

`rlasso` returns an object of S3 class `rlasso` for which methods like
`predict`, `print`, `summary` are provided. The methods `print` and
`summary` have the option `all`. By setting this option to `FALSE` only
the coefficients estimated to be non-zero are shown.

The function `rlassoEffects` does inference for prespecified target
variables. Those can be specified either by the variable names, an
integer valued vector giving their position in `x`, or by a logical
vector indicating the variables for which inference should be conducted.
It returns an object of S3 class `rlassoEffects` for which the methods
`summary`, `print`, `confint`, and `plot` are provided. `rlassoEffects`
is a wrapper function for `rlassoEffect` which does inference for a
single target regressor.

The function `rlassoEffects` might either be used in the form
`rlassoEffects(x, y, index)` where `x` is a matrix, `y` denotes the
outcome variable and `index` specifies the variables of `x` for which
inference is conducted. This can done by an integer vector (postion of
the variables), a logical vector or the name of the variables. An
alternative usage is as `rlassoEffects(formula, data, I)` where `I` is a
one-sided formula which specifies the variables for which is inference
is conducted. For further details we refer to the help page of the
function and the following examples where both methods for usage are
shown.

For logistic regression the corresponding functions are implemented in
an analogous manner, named `rlassologit` and `rlassologitEffects`.

## Example

First, we generate a data set on which we demonstrate the basic
functions:

``` r
set.seed(12345)
> n <- 100 #sample size
> p <- 100 # number of variables
> s <- 3 # number of variables with non-zero coefficients
> X <- matrix(rnorm(n*p), ncol=p)
> beta <- c(rep(5,s), rep(0,p-s))
> Y <- X%*%beta + rnorm(n)
```

Next we use Lasso for fitting and prediction, show the results and make
predictions for the old and for new X-variables

``` r
> lasso.reg <- rlasso(Y~X, post=FALSE, intercept=TRUE)  # use Lasso, not-post-Lasso
> # lasso.reg <- rlasso(X,Y, post=FALSE, intercept=TRUE) # alternative use
> summary(lasso.reg, all=FALSE) 

Call:
rlasso.formula(formula = Y ~ X, post = FALSE, intercept = TRUE)

100           -0.025

Residual standard error: 0.8039
Multiple R-squared:  0.9913
Adjusted R-squared:  0.9902
Joint significance test:
 the sup score statistic for joint significance test is 64.02 with a p-value of     0

> yhat.lasso <- predict(lasso.reg)   #in-sample prediction

> Ynew <-  Xnew%*%beta + rnorm(n)  #new Y
> yhat.lasso.new <- predict(lasso.reg, newdata=Xnew)  #out-of-sample prediction
```

To reduce bias, now use post-Lasso for fitting and prediction

``` r
> post.lasso.reg <- rlasso(Y~X, post=TRUE, intercept=TRUE)
> summary(post.lasso.reg, all=FALSE) 

Call:
rlasso.formula(formula = Y ~ X, post = TRUE, intercept = TRUE)

Residual standard error: 1.059
Multiple R-squared:  0.9855
Adjusted R-squared:  0.9851
Joint significance test:
 the sup score statistic for joint significance test is 66.87 with a p-value of     0

> yhat.postlasso <- predict(post.lasso.reg)  #in-sample prediction
> yhat.postlasso.new <- predict(post.lasso.reg, newdata=Xnew)  #out-of-sample prediction
```

We can do inference on a set of variables of interest, e.g. the first,
second, third, and the fiftieth:

``` r
> lasso.effect <- rlassoEffects(x=X, y=Y, index=c(1,2,3,50))
> print(lasso.effect)

Call:
rlassoEffects.default(x = X, y = Y, index = c(1, 2, 3, 50))

```

The confidence intervals for the coefficients are given by

``` r
> confint(lasso.effect)
         2.5 %    97.5 %
> confint(lasso.effect)
         2.5 %   97.5 %

V3   4.5716439 5.086726
V50 -0.0814167 0.358284
```

Moreover, simultaneous / joint confidence intervals can be calculated
which will be discussed in more detail later.

``` r
> confint(lasso.effect, joint = TRUE)
         2.5 %    97.5 %
V1   4.8464078 5.3315239
V2   4.4315649 5.1246107
V3   4.4864563 5.1719131
V50 -0.1720149 0.4488822
```

Finally, we can also plot the estimated effects with their confidence
intervals:

``` r
> plot(lasso.effect, main="Confidence Intervals")
```

A strength of the package is that it can also handle non-Gaussian and
heteroscedastic error what we illustrate with a small example:

``` r
> Y <- X%*%beta + rnorm(n, sd=sin(X%*%beta)^2)
> Y <- X%*%beta + rt(n, df=5)
> lasso.reg = rlasso(Y~X, post=FALSE, intercept=TRUE)  # use Lasso, not-post-Lasso
> summary(lasso.reg, all=FALSE) 

Call:
rlasso.formula(formula = Y ~ X, post = FALSE, intercept = TRUE)

# Joint/ simultaneous confidence intervals

## Introduction

[@BCK2014] provide uniformly valid confidence intervals for $p_1$ target
parameters which are defined via Huber's Z-problems. The Z-framework
encompasses, among other things, mean regression, median regression,
generalized linear models, as well as many other methods. The dimension
$p_1$ of the target parameter might be potentially much larger than the
sample size. Here we apply their results to the Lasso regression which
can be embedded into this framework. This enables the provision of
uniformly valid joint/ simultaneous confidence intervals for the target
parameters. This functionality is implemented via the functions
`rlassoEffects` and `confint`. To get joint confidence intervals the
option `joint` of the latter function has to be set to `TRUE`. In the
next section we illustrate this with an empirical illustration,
analysing the effect of gender on wage, to quantify potential
discrimination.

## Empirical application: the effect of gender on wage

In Labour Economics an important question is how the wage is related to
the gender of the employed. We use US census data from the year 2012 to
analyse the effect of gender and interaction effects of other variables
with gender on wage jointly. The dependent variable is the logarithm of
the wage, the target variable is `female` (in combination with other
variables). All other variables denote some other socio-economic
characteristics, e.g. marital status, education, and experience. For a
detailed description of the variables we refer to the help page.

First, we load and prepare the data.

``` r
> library(hdm)
> data(cps2012)
> X <- model.matrix( ~ -1 + female + female:(widowed + divorced + separated +

The parameter estimates for the target parameters, i.e. all coefficients
related to gender (i.e. by interaction with other variables) are
calculated and summarized by the following commands

Finally, we estimate and plot confident intervals, first \"pointwise\"
and then the joint confidence intervals.

``` r

This analysis allows a closer look how discrimination according to
gender is related to other socio-economic variables.

As a side remark, the version 0.2 allows also now a formula interface
for many functions including `rlassoEffects`. Hence, the analysis could
also be done more compact as

``` r
> effects.female <- rlassoEffects(lnw ~ female + female:(widowed + divorced + separated +
+ nevermarried + hsd08 + hsd911 + hsg + cg + ad + mw + so + we + exp1 + exp2 + exp3) + 
+ (widowed + divorced + separated + nevermarried  + 
+ hsd08 + hsd911 + hsg + cg + ad + mw + so + we + exp1 + exp2 + exp3)^2, data=cps2012,
+ I = ~  female + female:(widowed + divorced + separated + nevermarried  +
+ hsd08 + hsd911 + hsg + cg + ad + mw + so + we + exp1 + exp2 + exp3))
```

The one-sided option `I` gives the target variables for which inference
is conducted.

# Data sets

The package contains six data sets which are made available for
researchers. The growth data set contains the so-called Barro-Lee data
[@BarroLee1994]. It contains macroeconomics information for large set of
countries over several decades to analyse the drivers of economic
growth. Next, the package includes a data set on settler mortality and
economic outcomes which was used in the literature to illustrate the
effect of institutions on economic growth [@acemoglu:colonial]. The data
set `pension` contains information about the choice of 401(k) pension
plans and savings behaviour in the United States [@CH401k]. A data set
for analysing the effect of judicial decisions regarding eminent domain
on economic outcomes (e.g. house prices), is included. More information
is given in @chen:sethi and @BCCH12. The BLP data [@BLP] set was
analysed in Berry, Levinsohn and Pakes (1995). The data stem from annual
issues of the Automotive News Market Data Book. The data set inlcudes
information on all models marketed during the the period beginning 1971
and ending in 1990 cotaining 2217 model/years from 997 distinct models.
Finally, US census data (CPS2012) is included.\
All data sets are described in their help pages where also further
references can be found.

# Further functions for inference on structural parameters

Additionally, the package contains functions for estimation and
inference on structural parameters in a high-dimensional setting. An
important tool for estimation in the potential presence of endogeneity
is instrumental variable (IV) estimation. The function `rlassoIV`
implements methods for IV estimation in a high-dimensional setting. This
function is a wrapper for several methods. The user can specify if
selection shall be done on the instruments (z-variables), on the control
variables (x-variables), or on both. For the low-dimensional case where
no selection is done for the x- or z-variables `rlassoIV` performs
classical 2SLS estimation by calling the function `tsls`.

The goal of many empirical analyses is to understand and estimate the
causal effect of a treatment, e.g. the effect of an endogenous binary
treatment $D$, on a outcome, $Y$, in the presence of a binary
instrumental variable, $Z$, in settings with very many potential control
variables. We provide functions to estimate the local average treatment
effect (LATE), the local average treatment effect of the treated (LATET)
and as special cases the average treatment effect (ATE) and the average
treatment effect of the treated (ATET) in this setting in functions
`rlassoLATE`, `rlassoLATE`, `rlassoATE`, and `rlassoATET` respectively.
These functions also allow calculation of treatment effect standard
errors with different bootstrap methods ("wild", "normal", "Bayes")
besides to the classical plug-in standard errors. Moreover, methods
`print`, `summary`, and `confint`, are available.

Both the family of `rlassoIV`-functions and the family of the functions
for treatment effects , which are introduced in the next section, allow
use with both formula-interface and by handing over the prepard model
matrices. Hence the general pattern for use with formula is
`function(formula, data, ...)` where formula consists of two-parts and
is a member of the class `Formula`. These formulas are of the pattern
`y Â  d + x | x + z` where `y` is the outcome variable, `x` are exogenous
variables, `d` endogenous varialbes (if several ones are allowed depends
on the concrete function), and `z` denote the instrumental variables. A
more primitive use of the functions is by simply hand over the required
group of variables as matrices: `function(x=x, d=d, y=y, z=z)`. In some
of the following examples both alternatives are displayed.

## Example: IV estimation

In this section, we briefly present how instrumental variables
estimation is conducted in a high-dimensional setting. The eminent
domain example, for which the data set is contained in the package,
serves as an illustration. The underlying goal is to estimate the effect
of pro-plaintiff decisions in cases of eminent domain (government's
takings of private property) on economic outcomes. The analysis of the
effects of such decisions is complicated by the possible endogeneity
between judicial decisions and potential economic outcomes. To address
the potential endogeneity, we employ an instrumental variables strategy
based on the random assignment of judges to the federal appellate panels
that make the decisions. Because judges are randomly assigned to
three-judge panels, the judges and their demographics are randomly
assigned conditional on the distribution of characteristics of federal
circuit court judges in a given circuit-year.

First, we load the data and construct the matrices with the controls
(x), instruments (z), outcome (y), and treatment variables (d). Here we
consider regional GDP as the outcome variable.

``` r
> data(EminentDomain)
> z <- EminentDomain$logGDP$z
> x <- EminentDomain$logGDP$x
> y <- EminentDomain$logGDP$y
> d <- EminentDomain$logGDP$d
```

As mentioned above, $y$ is the economic outcome, the logarithm of the
GDP, $d$ the number of pro plaintiff appellate takings decisions in
federal circuit court $c$ and year $t$, $x$ is a matrix with control
variables, and $z$ is the matrix with instruments. Here we consider
socio-economic and demographic characteristics of the judges as
instruments.

Next, we estimate the model with selection on the instruments.

``` r
> lasso.IV.Z <- rlassoIV(x=x, d=d, y=y, z=z, select.X=FALSE, select.Z=TRUE) 
> # or lasso.IV.Z <- rlassoIVselectZ(x=X, d=d, y=y, z=Z) 
> summary(lasso.IV.Z)
[1] "Estimates and significance testing of the effect of target variables in the 
     IV regression model"
    coeff.     se. t-value p-value
d1 0.01543 0.01926   0.801   0.423
```

Finally, we do selection on both the $x$ and $z$ variables.

``` r
> lasso.IV.XZ <- rlassoIV(x=x, d=d, y=y, z=z, select.X=TRUE, select.Z=TRUE) 
> summary(lasso.IV.XZ)
Estimates and Significance Testing of the effect of target variables in the
     IV regression model 
     coeff.      se. t-value p-value
d1 -0.03488  0.15881   -0.22   0.826

> confint(lasso.IV.XZ)
        2.5 %    97.5 %
d1 -0.3461475 0.2763868
```

## Example: treatment effects

Here we apply the treatment functions to 401(k) plan participation.
Though it is clear that 401(k) plans are widely used as vehicles for
retirement saving, their effect on assets is less clear. The key problem
in determining the effect of participation in 401(k) plans on
accumulated assets is saver heterogeneity coupled with nonrandom
selection into participation states. In particular, it is generally
recognized that some people have a higher preference for saving than
others. Thus, it seems likely that those individuals with the highest
unobserved preference for saving would be most likely to choose to
participate in tax-advantaged retirement savings plans and would also
have higher savings in other assets than individuals with lower
unobserved saving propensity. This implies that conventional estimates
that do not allow for saver heterogeneity and selection of the
participation state will be biased upward, tending to overstate the
actual savings effects of 401(k) and IRA participation.

Again, we start first with the data preparation. For a detailed
description of the data set we refer to the help page `help(pension)`.

``` r
data(pension)
y <- pension$tw; d = pension$p401; z = pension$e401
X <- pension[,c("i2", "i3", "i4", "i5", "i6", "i7", "a2", "a3", "a4", "a5",
               "fsize", "hs", "smcol", "col", "marr", "twoearn", "db", "pira", "hown")]
 # simple model
xvar <- c("i2", "i3", "i4", "i5", "i6", "i7", "a2", "a3", "a4", "a5",
         "fsize", "hs", "smcol", "col", "marr", "twoearn", "db", "pira", "hown")
xpart <- paste(xvar, collapse = "+")
form <- as.formula(paste("tw ~ ", paste(c("p401", xvar), collapse ="+"), "|",  
	paste(xvar, collapse = "+")))
formZ <- as.formula(paste("tw ~ ", paste(c("p401", xvar), collapse ="+"), "|", 
	paste(c("e401", xvar), collapse = "+")))
```

Now we can compute the estimates of the target treatment effect
parameters:

``` r
> #pension.ate =  rlassoATE(X,d,y)
> pension.ate = rlassoATE(form, data = pension)
> summary(pension.ate)

The results are summarized in Table 1. We see that in this example the

# Application: estimation of the effect of price on demand

## Introduction

A core problems in Economics is to estimate the effect of price on the
demand of products. This is usually impeded by the fact that price are
not exogenously given, but determined by demand and supply in a
simultaneous system of equations, introducing endogeneity. A possible
way to solve this problem is to employ instrumental variables - a
technique which is also getting more popular outside of Economics. The
results found here are a replication in Rof the results in
[@CHS:ManyIVNote] and [@CHS2015].

here we are interested in estimating the coefficients in a simple logit
model of demand for automobiles using market share data. Our example is
based on the data and most basic strategy from [@BLP]. The goal is to
estimate the influence / effect of the price on demand (=market share).
Specifically,

$$\log(s_{it}) - \log(s_{0t}) = \alpha_0 p_{it} + x_{it}' \beta_0 + \varepsilon_{it},$$

$$p_{it} = z_{it}' \delta_0 + x_{it}' \gamma_0 + u_{it},$$

where $s_it$ is the market share of product $i$ in market $t$ with
product zero denoting the outside option, $p_{it}$ is the price and is
treated as endogenous, $x_{it}$ are observed included product
characteristics, and $z_{it}$ are instruments. In the data set the
variable $y$ is defined as $\log(s_{it}) - \log(s_{0t})$.

In our example, we use the same set of product characteristics
($x$-variables) as used in obtaining the basic results in [@BLP].
Specifically, we use five variables in $x_{it}$: a constant, an air
conditioning dummy, horsepower divided by weight, miles per dollar, and
vehicle size. We refer to these five variables as the baseline set of
controls.

We also adopt the argument from [@BLP] to form our potential
instruments. BLP argue that that characteristics of other products will
satisfy an exclusion restriction,
$\textrm{E}[\varepsilon_{it}|x_{j\tau}] = 0$ for any $\tau$ and
$j \ne i$, and thus that any function of characteristics of other
products may be used as instrument for price. This condition leaves a
very high-dimensional set of potential instruments as any combination of
functions of $\{x_{j\tau}\}_{j \ne i, \tau \ge 1}$ may be used to
instrument for $p_{it}$. To reduce the dimensionality, BLP use intuition
and an exchangeability argument to motivate consideration of a small
number of these potential instruments formed by taking sums of product
characteristics formed by summing over products excluding product $i$.
Specifically, we form baseline instruments by taking
$$z_{k,it} = \left(\sum_{r \ne i, r \in \mathcal{I}_f} x_{k,rt} , \sum_{r \ne i, r \notin \mathcal{I}_f} x_{k,rt} \right)$$
where $x_{k,it}$ is the $k^{th}$ element of vector $x_{it}$ and
$\mathcal{I}_f$ denotes the set of products produced by firm $f$. This
choice yields a vector $z_{it}$ consisting of 10 instruments. We refer
to this set of instruments as the baseline instruments.

While the choice of the baseline instruments and controls is motivated
by good intuition and economic theory, it should be noted that theory
does not clearly state which product characteristics or instruments
should be used in the model. Theory also fails to indicate the
functional form with which any such variables should enter the model.
High-dimensional methods outlined offer one strategy to help address
these concerns which complements the economic intuition motivating the
baseline controls and instruments. As an illustration, we consider an
expanded set of controls and instruments. We augment the set of
potential controls with all first order interactions of the baseline
variables, quadratics and cubics in all continuous baseline variables,
and a time trend which yields a total of 24 $x$-variables. We refer to
these as the augmented controls. We then take sums of these
characteristics as potential instruments following the original strategy
which yields 48 potential instruments.

## Estimation

The data set is included in the package an can be accessed in the
following way

``` r
data(BLP)
BLPData <- BLP$BLP
```

A detailed description of the data is given in [@BLP] and also on the
help page.

In the base line model we consider five x-variables and ten instrumental
variables as described above. First we process the data, in particular
we construct the design matrices for the x- and z-variables.The matrix
of instruments $Z$ is shipped with the data set but could also be
constructed with the internal function `constructIV` in the package
*hdm*.

``` r
attach(BLPData)
X <- as.matrix(cbind(1, BLPData[,c("hpwt", "air", "mpd", "space")]))
Z <- BLP$Z
#Z <- hdm:::constructIV(firm.id, cdid, id, X)
```

With the baseline x- and z- variables, we estimate the price-effect with
ols, tsls, and finally with selection on the x- and z-variables.

``` r
ols.reg <- lm(y~ price + hpwt + air + mpd + space, data =BLPData)
tsls.reg <- tsls(x=X, d=price, y=y, z=Z, intercept =FALSE, homoscedastic = FALSE)
lasso.reg <- rlassoIV(x=X[,-1], y=y, z=Z, d=price, select.X=TRUE, select.Z=TRUE,
 intercept = TRUE)
```

The results are summarized in the table below:

  -------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                Method   Price coefficient   Standard error
  ------------------------------------ ------------------- ----------------
                          Baseline OLS              -0.089            0.004

                         Baseline TSLS              -0.136            0.012

    Baseline TSLS with Lasso selection              -0.174            0.013
  -------------------------------------------------------------------------

  : Table 2: Results baseline model

Next, we estimate the augmented model which in total has 24 controls and
48 instruments First, we construct the data needed to estimate the
augmented model. The set of augmented IVs can be accessed by

``` r
augZ <- BLP$augZ
```

``` r
tu <- trend/19
mpdu <- mpd/7
spaceu <- space/2
augX = cbind(1, hpwt, air, mpdu, spaceu, tu, hpwt^2, hpwt^3, mpdu^2, mpdu^3, 
        spaceu^2, spaceu^3, tu^2, tu^3, hpwt*air, mpdu*air, spaceu*air, tu*air,
        hpwt*mpdu, hpwt*spaceu, hpwt*tu, mpdu*spaceu, mpdu*tu, spaceu*tu)
colnames(augX) <- c("constant", "hpwt", "air", "mpdu", "spaceu", "tu", "hpwt^2", "hpwt^3",
 "mpdu^2", "mpdu^3", "spaceu^2", "spaceu^3", "tu^2", "tu^3", "hpwt*air", "mpdu*air",
 "spaceu*air", "tu*air", "hpwt*mpdu", "hpwt*spaceu", "hpwt*tu", "mpdu*spaceu", "mpdu*tu",
 "spaceu*tu")
# augZ <- hdm:::constructIV(firm.id, cdid, id, augX) # construction of augmented set of IVs
```

Next, we redo the analysis with augmented set of variables:

``` r
ols.reg <- lm(y~  -1 + cbind(price, augX))
tsls.reg <- tsls(x=augX, d=price, y=y, z=augZ, intercept =FALSE, homoscedastic = FALSE)
lasso.reg <- rlassoIV(x=augX[,-1], y=y, z=augZ, d=price, select.X=TRUE, select.Z=TRUE,
 intercept = TRUE)
```

The results for the augmented model are presented in the table:

  --------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                 Method   Price coefficient   Standard error

                         Augmented TSLS              -0.127            0.008

## Results

We report estimation results from the baseline and augmented setting in
the tables above. The estimations all give a negative effect of price on
demand as expected, but they differ considerably in size of the effects.
In the augmented model we get the strongest influence of price on the
market share and we see that the choice of instruments is an important
issue.

# Summary

The package *hdm* contains methods for estimation and inference in a
high-dimensional setting. We have presented a short overview of the
functions implemented. The package also contains data sets which might
be useful for classroom presentations and as applications for newly
developed estimators. More examples and a short introduction in the
underlying theoretical concepts are provided in the accompanying
vignette. It is planned to extend the functionality and to improve the
performance of the functions in subsequent versions of the package.

[^1]: A formal definition of approximately sparse models can be found in
    the accompanying vignette.

[^2]: In some cases the user might want to use a predefined, fixed
    penalization parameter. This can be done by a special option in the
    following way: set homoscedastic to \"none\" and supply a value
    (vector) `lambda.start`. Then this value is used as penalty
    parameter with independent design and heteroscedastic errors to
    weight the regressors.
