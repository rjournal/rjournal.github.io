Dear Professor Hyndman,
\bigskip

We would like to submit a revised version of our manuscript titled "SNSeg: An R Package for Time Series Segmentation via Self-Normalization" (Manuscript ID: 2023-79) for possible publication in the R Journal.

We have carefully considered the comments from the two reviewers and have revised the paper accordingly. The detailed responses to the two reviewers are attached as separate files.

Below we highlight the major changes in the revision: 

1. We have adjusted the inner computation step of the function SNSeg_Uni() when users define their own functions to estimate changes in specific types of functionals that are not covered by our pre-defined functions. The new function possesses the same inputs and outputs as that of the old version but the execution time drastically decreases.

2. We have further added a new Appendix section, which includes the detailed settings of the functions in R packages used in our comparison study reported in Tables 3 and 4.

We thank you and the reviewers for your time in reviewing our work. The comments helped improve the quality of our paper. For easy referencing, new materials in the first-round revision are highlighted in blue and those in the second-round revision are highlighted in red in the manuscript. We hope that you now find it a suitable contribution to the R Journal.
