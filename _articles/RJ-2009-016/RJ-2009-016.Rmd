title: 'Rattle: A Data Mining GUI for R'
abstract: Data mining delivers insights, patterns, and descriptive and predictive
  models from the large amounts of data available today in many organisations. The
  data miner draws heavily on methodologies, techniques and algorithms from statistics,
  machine learning, and computer science. R increasingly provides a powerful platform
  for data mining. However, scripting and programming is sometimes a challenge for
  data analysts moving into data mining. The Rattle package provides a graphical user
  interface specifically for data mining using R. It also provides a stepping stone
  toward using R as a programming language for data analysis.
