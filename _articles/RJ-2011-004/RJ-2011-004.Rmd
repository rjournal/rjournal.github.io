::: article
The package [*digitize*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=digitize),
that I present here, allows a user to load a graphical file of a
scatterplot (with the help of the `read.jpeg` function of the
[*ReadImages*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=ReadImages) package)
in the graphical window of R, and to use the `locator` function to
calibrate and extract the data. Calibration is done by setting four
reference points on the original graph axis, two for the $x$ values and
two for the $y$ values. The use of four points for calibration is
justified by the fact that it makes calibrations on the axis possible,
as $y$ data are not taken into account for calibration of the $x$ axis,
and vice versa.

This is useful when working on data that are not available in digital
form, e.g. when integrating old papers in meta-analyses. Several
commercial or free software packages allow a user to extract data from a
plot in image format, among which we can cite PlotDigitizer
(<http://plotdigitizer.sourceforge.net/>) or the commercial package
GraphClick (<http://www.arizona-software.ch/graphclick/>). While these
programs are powerful and quite ergonomic, for some lightweight use, one
may want to load the graph directly into R, and as a result get the data
directly in R format. This paper presents a rapid digitization of a
scatterplot and subsequent statistical analysis of the data. As an
example, we will use the data presented by Jacques Monod in a seminal
microbiology paper [@Monod1949].

The original paper presents the growth rate (in terms of divisions per
hour) of the bacterium *Escherichia coli* in media of increasing glucose
concentration. Such a hyperbolic relationship is best represented by the
equation $$R=R_{K} \; \frac{C}{C_{1}+C},$$ where $R$ is the growth rate
at a given concentration of nutrients $C$, $R_{K}$ is the maximal growth
rate, $C_{1}$ is the concentration of nutrients at which $R=0.5 R_{K}$.
In R, this function is written as

``` r
MonodGrowth <- function(params, M) \{ 
   with(params, rK*(M/(M1+M)))
\}
```

In order to characterize the growth parameters of a bacterial
population, one can measure its growth rate in different concentrations
of nutrients. @Monod1949 proposed that, in the measured population,
$R_{K} = 1.35$ and $C_{1} =22 \times 10^{-6}$. By using the
[*digitize*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=digitize) package to
extract the data from this paper, we will be able to get our own
estimates for these parameters.

Values of $R_{K}$ and $C_{1}$ were estimated using a simple genetic
algorithm, which minimizes the error function (sum of squared errors)
defined by

``` r
MonodError <- function(params, M, y) \{
   with(params,
        sum((MonodGrowth(params, M)-y)^2))
\}
```

![Figure 1: Original figure, as obtained after pointing and clicking the
data. Calibration was made using the points $x_{1}=1$, $x_{2}=8$,
$y_{1}=0.5$ and $y_{2}=1$. All the points that have been clicked are
marked by a red point. The digitization of each series is stopped by
right-clicking or pressing the Esc key. ](figures/digit.png){#fig:monod
width="100%" alt="graphic without alt text"}

The first step when using the
[*digitize*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=digitize) package is to
specify four points on the graph that will be used to calibrate the
axes. They must be in the following order : leftmost $x$, rightmost $x$,
lower $y$, upper $y$. For the first two of them, the $y$ value is not
important (and vice versa). For this example, it is assumed that we set
the first two points at $x_{1}=1$ and $x_{2}=8$, and the two last points
at $y_{1}=0.5$ and $y_{2}=1$, simply by clicking in the graphical window
at these positions (preferentially on the axes). It should be noted that
it is not necessary to calibrate using the extremity of the axes.

Loading the figure and printing it in the current device for calibration
is done by

``` r
cal <- ReadAndCal('monod.jpg')
```

Once the graph appears in the window, the user must input (by clicking
on them) the four calibration points, marked as blue crosses. The
calibration values will be stocked in the `cal` object, which is a list
with $x$ and $y$ values. The next step is to read the data, simply by
pointing and clicking on the graph. This is done by calling the
`DigitData` function, whose arguments are the type of lines/points
drawn.

``` r
growth <- DigitData(col = 'red')
```

When all the points have been identified, the digitization is stopped in
the same way that one stops the `locator` function, i.e. either by
right-clicking or pressing the `Esc` key (see `?locator`). The outcome
of this step is shown in figure [1](#fig:monod). The next step for these
data to be exploitable is to use the calibration information to have the
correct coordinates of the points. We can do this by using the function
`Calibrate(data,calpoints,x1,x2,y1,y2)`, and the correct coordinates of
the points of calibration (`x1`, `x2`, `y1` and `y2` correspond,
respectively, to the points $x_{1}$, $x_{2}$, $y_{1}$ and $y_{2}$).

``` r
data <- Calibrate(growth, cal, 1, 8, 0.5, 1)
```

The internals of the function `Calibrate` are quite simple. If we
consider $X = \left(X_{1},X_{2}\right)$ a vector containing the $x$
coordinates of the calibration points for the $x$ axis on the graphic
window, and $x = \left(x_{1},x_{2}\right)$ a vector with their true
value, it is straightforward that $x=aX+b$. As such, performing a simple
linear regression of `x` against `X` allows us to determine the
coefficients to convert the data. The same procedure is repeated for the
$y$ axis. One advantage of this method of calibration is that you do not
need to focus on the $y$ value of the points used for $x$ calibration,
and reciprocally. It means that in order to accurately calibrate a
graph, you only need to have two $x$ coordinates, and two $y$
coordinates. Eventually, it is very simple to calibrate the graphic by
setting the calibration points directly on the tick mark of their axis.

The object returned by `Calibrate` is of class `"data.frame"`, with
columns `"x"` and `"y"` representing the $x$ and $y$ coordinates so that
we can plot it directly. The following code produces Figure
[2](#fig:result), assuming that `out` is a list containing the arguments
of `MonodGrowth` obtained after optimization (`out$set`), and `paper` is
the same list with the values of @Monod1949.

``` r
plot(data$x, data$y, pch=20, col='grey',
     xlab = 'Nutrients concentration',
     ylab = 'Divisions per hour')
points(xcal, MonodGrowth(out\$set, xcal),
       type = 'l', lty = 1, lwd = 2)
points(xcal, MonodGrowth(paper, xcal), 
       type = 'l', lty = 2)
legend('bottomright',
legend = c('data', 'best fit', 'paper value'),
           pch = c(20, NA, NA),
           lty = c(NA, 1, 2),
           lwd = c(NA, 2, 1),
           col = c('grey', 'black', 'black'),
           bty = 'n')
```

![Figure 2: Result of the digitization. Original data are in grey, the
proposed fit is in the dashed line, and the estimate realized from the
raw data is in the bold line. Our estimates for the growth parameters
are $R_{K}=1.43$ and $C_{1}=62 \times 10^{-6}$.](figures/result.png){#fig:result width="100%" alt="graphic without alt text"}

While using the `MonodError` function with the proposed parameters
yields a sum of squares of $1.32$, our estimated parameters minimizes
this value to $0.45$, thus suggesting that the values of $R_{K}$ and
$C_{1}$ presented in the paper are not optimal given the data.

# Conclusion

I presented an example of using the
[*digitize*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=digitize) package to
reproduce data in an ancient paper that are not available in digital
form. While the principle of this package is really simple, it allows
for a quick extraction of data from a scatterplot (or any kind of planar
display), which can be useful when data from old or proprietary figures
are needed.
