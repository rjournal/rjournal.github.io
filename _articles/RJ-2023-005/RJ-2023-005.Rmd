title: 'HostSwitch: An R Package to Simulate the Extent of Host-Switching by a Consumer'
abstract: ' In biology a general definition for host switch is when an organism (consumer)
  uses a new host (which represents a resource). The host switch process by a consumer
  may happen through its pre-existing capability to use a sub-optimal resource. The
  [HostSwitch](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=HostSwitch) R package provides functions
  to simulate the dynamics of host switching (extent and frequency) in the population
  of a consumer that interacts with current and potential hosts over the generations.
  The [HostSwitch](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=HostSwitch) package is based
  on a Individual-Based mock-up model published in FORTRAN by @araujo_understanding_2015.
  The package largely improve the previous mock-up model, by implementing numerous
  new functionalities such as comparison and evaluation of simulations with several
  customizable parameters to accommodate several types of biological consumer-host
  associations, an interactive visualization of the model, an in-depth description
  of the parameters in a biological context. Finally, we provided three real world
  scenarios taken from the literature selected from ecology, agriculture and parasitology.
  This package is intended to reach researchers in the broad field of biology interested
  in simulating the process of host switch of different types of symbiotic biological
  associations.'
