title: 'HostSwitch: An R Package to Simulate the Extent of Host-Switching by a Consumer'
abstract: In biology a general definition for host switch is when an organism (consumer)
  uses a new host (which represents a resource). The host switch process by a consumer
  may happen through its pre-existing capability to use a sub-optimal resource. The
  [*HostSwitch*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=HostSwitch) R package provides
  functions to simulate the dynamics of host switching (extent and frequency) in the
  population of a consumer that interacts with current and potential hosts over the
  generations. The [*HostSwitch*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=HostSwitch) package
  is based on a Individual-Based mock-up model published in FORTRAN by @araujo_understanding_2015.
  The package largely improve the previous mock-up model, by implementing numerous
  new functionalities such as comparison and evaluation of simulations with several
  customizable parameters to accommodate several types of biological consumer-host
  associations, an interactive visualization of the model, an in-depth description
  of the parameters in a biological context. Finally, we provided three real world
  scenarios taken from the literature selected from ecology, agriculture and parasitology.
  This package is intended to reach researchers in the broad field of biology interested
  in simulating the process of host switch of different types of symbiotic biological
  associations.

# Introduction

In several branches of biology (such as for example ecology, evolution,
parasitology) a general definition for host-switching (or host shift) is
when a consumer uses a newly colonized host, which represents its
resource. Different spatial and temporal outcomes may result from the
new host-consumer association depending on whether or not the
colonization is successful. Studies on the evolution of biotic
associations relies on an increasing body of literature covering all
prototypical examples of symbiotic relationship categories
[@thompson_four_2010]. Symbiosis *sensu lato* is defined here as any
interaction between two organisms of different species. The possible
influence between interacting organisms has been placed in a continuum
of association types defined by their role, direction, and extension;
and it varies from mutual consumption to unidirectional exploitation
[@dimijian_evolving_2000; @dimijian_evolving_2000-1]. In the
interspecific associations, the interacting organisms may play the role
of strict consumer (e.g., predator) or resource (e.g., prey). Evolution
of the associations may include several concatenated events of
speciation affecting one or both species and it is driven by four main
processes: cospeciation, host switch, failure to speciate and \"missing
the boat\" [@page_introduction_2002]. While the prevalent paradigm
considers cospeciation to be the main process driving evolution of most
biological associations, recent evidence showed that, given the
opportunity, a consumer may use a sub-optimal resource (or host) by
host-switching without the need for any genetic innovation. This may
explain the rapid origin of novel associations (i.e. colonization of
novel hosts at the ecological time scale) eventually followed by
speciation (at the evolutionary time) as well the observed incongruences
of the paired phylogenies (see @brooks_stockholm_2019 for a review).
Computer simulation modeling provide a valid tool to understand
ecological and evolutionary dynamic of interacting species. To
theoretically support the importance of host switch events, an
Individual-Based Model (IBM) has been proposed by
@araujo_understanding_2015 (mock-up model hereafter). The model
simulates the extent of host-switching in a host-parasite association
formalized as the probability of an individual to disperse and
successfully colonize a novel host. Recently, @feronato_accidents_2021
provided a further add-on to the model by exploring the significance and
the interaction of three parameters thought to be of paramount
importance for the acquisition of a new host by a parasite. By using
simulated data, these two initial papers provided important insights on
the dynamic of host-switches for a parasite species. The main results
were that host switch on a new host does not require prior evolutionary
novelty, pathogens may survive on sub-optimal hosts which results in
increased chance of host-switching to hosts more distant, and some
parameters facilitate host switching (e.g., mutation and reproductive
rate).

Both models were coded and run in FORTRAN language. Although available
in an executable version (Windows, Linux, and MacOS), the previous
mock-up model still lacks a user-friendly interface, and the
manipulation of parameters is broadly limited. The current access to the
model is restricted to certain groups of users who know how to compile
and code in FORTRAN.

We present here a user-friendly R package, called
[*HostSwitch*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=HostSwitch), which
improves the earlier version published in FORTRAN
[@araujo_understanding_2015; @feronato_accidents_2021] in three main
ways:

\(1\) by increasing the accessibility of the model to researchers that
are not familiar with FORTRAN;

\(2\) by including customizable parameters, some previously unreleased
(e.g., $jump\_back$), that allow us to extend the mock-up model from
strict pathology (i.e., simulating host switches by pathogen) to other
branches of biology such as ecology, microbiology, agriculture (covering
a very broader spectrum of symbiotic *sensu lato* associations, see
Implementation and Usage scenarios sections for further details)
reaching a broader audience;

\(3\) by providing in-depth descriptions of the parameters in a
biological context, and examples of possible uses with real world data
(see Usage scenarios section).

To our knowledge, there are no R packages that simulate the events of
host switch using the theoretical approach briefly presented above and
widely discussed in previous papers
[@araujo_understanding_2015; @agosta_how_2010; @brooks_stockholm_2019].
However, is worth to mention that there are one putatively similar
packages that may be used to simulate host switches. Notably, the
package [*EpiILM*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=EpiILM)
[@RJ-2020-020] uses discrete-time individual-level models to simulate
the dynamic of infection disease transmission. The
[*EpiILM*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=EpiILM) package differs
from the one present here for a fundamental point:
[*HostSwitch*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=HostSwitch) simulate
the host switch using the point of view of the consumer, rather than the
host, and formalize the probability as random encounters of new hosts
different to one other. For further details of the model formalize in
[*EpiILM*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=EpiILM) are presented in
@deardon_inference_2010.

In Section \"The model\", we describe the mathematical framework for
simulating the dispersion and the survival of individuals of a
population on a novel resource which describes the event of
host-switching. In Section \"Implementation\", we describe the
implementation of the mock-up model in the
[*HostSwitch*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=HostSwitch) package,
including a description of the arguments of the main functions. In
Section \"Usage scenarios\" we used empirical data gathered from the
literature to simulate and compare different scenarios of host switch.
We also present possible hypotheses and research questions that can be
explored using the simulation approach.

# The model

The simulation model of
[*HostSwitch*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=HostSwitch) aims to
measure the dynamics of host switching (extent and frequency) in the
population of an organism (hereafter Consumer) that interacts with
current and potential hosts (hereafter Resource) over generations. A
successful host switch implies that a Consumer may colonize a new
Resource, which in turn imposes selection pressure that impacts the
Consumers' survival. The host-switching relies on a mechanism of
ecological readjustment or ecological fitting, i.e. the capability of
the Consumer to use a similar Resource even if sub-optimal
[@janzen1985ecological; @agosta2008ecological]. The fundamental aspect
of the [*HostSwitch*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=HostSwitch)
simulation model is to track, summarize and compare the dispersion and
successful host switch events in a new Resource by the populations of
the Consumer. Although the model and the basic parameters have been
previously described in @araujo_understanding_2015 and
@feronato_accidents_2021, we provide here a revised description of the
modeling dynamic which accommodates all symbiotic (*sensu lato*)
associations.

The Resource is characterized by a real number, $p_{Opt}$, randomly
selected from a uniform distribution ranging from $p_{Res\_min}$ to
$p_{Res\_max}$. This number represents the optimum phenotype imposed on
Consumers by the Resource. Besides, the Resource imposes a carrying
capacity K on the Consumer population. Individuals of the Consumer have
a phenotype which can evolve over generations due to the emergence of
novelties (hereafter mutations). Each individual consumer $i$ is
characterized by one phenotype $p_{i}$. The simulation starts
(generation n = 0) with all M consumer individuals having the same
phenotype value ($p_{i}$ = $p_{Ind}$) which is equal to the average
value in the resource range (($p_{Res\_min}$ + $p_{Res\_max}$)/2). At
each generation, a novel Resource is offered and all Consumers have a
probability $mig$ to migrate from the current to the novel Resource. The
number of dispersing individuals is calculated by assigning to each
individual a value that follows the random uniform distribution. All the
individuals with a value lower than $mig$ disperse to the new Resource.
Then, the assigned value may be interpreted ecologically as intrinsic or
extrinsic characteristics involved in the dispersal event (e.g.,
morphological features, environmental constraints). The parameter $mig$
defines a criterion for inclusion, with higher values allowing more
individuals to disperse at each generation. The dispersion event has two
possible outcomes: no migration (m1) and migration (m2).

-   $(m1)$ No individual disperses to the novel Resource and the model
    continues in the current Resource through the selection event. The
    Resource imposes on each individual a selection and the survival
    probability is calculated using the following equation:
    $$\begin{gathered}
     P ({p_{i}},{p_{Opt}}) = \exp{[- \frac{({p_{i}}-{p_{Opt}})^2}{2\sigma_{sel}^2}]} ,
    \end{gathered}$$
    where $p_{i}$ is the phenotype of $i$-th Consumer attempting to
    survive on the Resource; $p_{Opt}$ is the optimum phenotype the
    Consumer should have to maximize survival success on the Resource;
    ~sel~ is the standard deviation of a Gaussian distribution which is
    inversely related to the strength of selection. It may be
    interpreted as a proxy for the amplitude of the fitness space of the
    Consumer, the higher the ~sel~, the lower the selection and the
    higher the probability of surviving. Ecologically this value may be
    related to the niche breadth for the Consumer.
-   $(m2)$ Some individuals disperse and they go through a selection
    event on the novel Resource following eqn 1 (but with new $p_{Opt}$
    values, randomly defined). Here, the survival event has two possible
    outcomes: no survival (s1) and survival (s2).
    -   $(s1)$ None of the individuals survive and the model continues
        with the portion of individuals that did not migrate and are in
        the current (original) Resource, if dispersing individuals are
        not allowed to come back to the current Resource, or with
        individuals that did not migrate and those jumping back to the
        current Resource. The model imposes to these individuals a
        survival probability according to eqn 1.
    -   $(s2)$ Some individuals survive and the model continues only
        with those individuals.

All other individuals are ignored in subsequent steps. The novel
Resource then becomes current Resource and the individuals will
reproduce with a net reproduction rate $b$, limited to the carrying
capacity K. The offspring's phenotype (inherit from the parents, plus
variation $\delta$) is assigned to each individual and calculated using
the normal probability function:
$$\begin{gathered}
 P (\delta) = \exp{[\frac{-\delta^2}{2\sigma_{mut}^2}]} ,
\end{gathered}$$
where $\delta$ is random phenotypic variation assigned to each
individual; $\sigma_{mut}$ is the standard deviation for
mutation. The parameter $\delta$ is randomly defined from a Gaussian
distribution centered in zero and with a standard deviation
$\sigma_{mut}$. Offspring phenotypes are equal to the
arithmetic average of their parent's phenotypes plus $\delta$ (i.e the
extent of genetic novelty introduced with the reproduction). The
descendants replace their parents and will populate generation n+1 that
will start over with another dispersion event to a novel Resource.

The overview of the main steps of the model are summarized in
Figure [1](#figure:modeloverview).\

![Figure 1: Overview of the host-switching simulation model. At each
generation every individual consumer has the chance to disperse to a
novel Resource (on the right in green) and colonize it, or to jump back
to the original Resource (on the left in blue). Selection (see eqn 1) is
imposed by the current and the novel Resource. Individuals that survive
the selection start a new generation after the reproduction event (see
eqn 2). The framework is largely modified from Figure 1 after
@araujo_understanding_2015, more details in the text. z~i~ = phenotype
of $i$-th Consumer; z~opt~ = phenotype that the Consumer should have to
fit the novel Resource; z~opt\ new~ = phenotype that the Consumer
retains on the current Resource after successful colonization of novel
Resource; $mig$ = a parameter defining the probability of dispersion of
each Consumer.](Flowchart_HSmodelDEF2.png){#figure:modeloverview

  : Table 1: Description of the six functions in
  [*HostSwitch*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=HostSwitch) package
:::

The [*HostSwitch*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=HostSwitch)
package is implemented around two main functions: `survivalProbability`
and `simHostSwitch`. The former includes the formula of the survival
probability (eqn 1), and the latter simulates host switches according to
Figure [1](#figure:modeloverview) and encompasses dispersion, selection
and reproduction events. `simHostSwitch` uses the `survivalProbability`
function to calculate the probability of survival of the individuals on
the current and new Resources.

The arguments of the `simHostSwitch` function are:

-   $K$: carrying capacity, positive integer (min = 1, max = 1000),
    default value: 100.
-   $b$: net reproduction rate; average number of offspring that a
    population of the Consumer produces at each generation, integer
    value (min = 0), default value: 10.
-   $mig$: define the number of migrating individuals at each
    generation, numeric value (min = 0, max = 1), default value: 0.01.
    Larger values indicate higher probability to migrate.
-   $sd$: standard deviation for mutation, numeric value (min = 0, max =
    10), default value: 0.2. It corresponds to ~mut~ in (eqn 2).
-   $sigma$: standard deviation of the survival function, numeric value
    (min = 0, max = 10), default value: 1. It corresponds to ~sel~ in
    (eqn 1).
-   $pRes\_min$: smallest optimum phenotype value imposed by the
    Resource, numeric value (min = 1, max = $pRes\_max$), default value:
    1.
-   $pRes\_max$: highest optimum phenotype value imposed by the
    Resource, numeric value (min = $pRes\_min$, max = 100), default
    value: 10.
-   $n\_generations$: number of generations, positive integer (min = 1,
    max = 50000), default value: 200.
-   $jump\_back$: option for Consumers that do not survive on the novel
    Resource. If \"yes\" the consumer(s) is able to jump back to the
    current Resource and will be considered in the selective pressure
    and reproduction stage for the n+1 generation, if \"no\" (default)
    it cannot jump back and dies on the new host.
-   $seed$: a single value useful for creating simulations or random
    objects that can be reproduced, positive integer (\>0), default
    value: NULL.
-   $n\_sim$: number of simulations, positive integer (min = 1, max =
    50000), default value: 1.
-   $nInitConsumer$: propagule size (or number of initial individuals)
    at the generation n = 0, default value: 20.
-   $data$, $column$: instead of the arguments outlined above, the user
    may pass to the function a vector ($column=$) saved in a matrix or
    dataframe ($data=$) which specifies all or some of the arguments
    above, default value: NULL. The default value will be set if the
    argument is not provided. The arguments provided in dataframe will
    be overwritten if provided as an argument in the `simHostSwitch`
    function.

Using the `simHostSwitch` function, the R command below generates an
object of class 'HostSwitch' which is a list of 18 elements, six
simulated quantities and 12 used parameters (arguments of the function).

``` r
 # generate a simulated 'HostSwitch' object using default values for the parameters
 > sim1 <- simHostSwitch(n_sim= 3, seed = 2)
```

The simulated quantities are:

-   $pRes\_sim$: a vector of the optimum phenotypes (one for each
    generation) that Consumers should have to be favored by the current
    Resource;
-   $pRes\_new\_sim$: a vector of the optimum phenotypes (one for each
    generation) that Consumers should have to be favored by the novel
    Resource;
-   $pInd\_sim$: list of vectors that includes the individual phenotype
    values of the Consumers in the population of each generation;
-   $pInd\_jump\_sim$: vector of number of migrating individuals at each
    generation. The vector length is always equal to the 'n_generation'
    parameter, if the simulation ends before the 'n_generation' value
    then the vector will include a 'NA' by default;
-   $pInd\_whichjump\_sim$: list of vectors that extracts the individual
    phenotype values of the Consumers who disperse in a novel Resource
    in each population and generation;
-   $pInd\_whichsurv\_sim$: list of vectors that extracts the individual
    phenotype values of the Consumers who successful colonize a novel
    Resource in each population and generation;

The function `summaryHostSwitch` creates a summary of basic statistics
for phenotypes, dispersion and host switch events. The argument $warmup$
defines the number of generations to be excluded from summary
statistics. If $warmup$ = 1 the generation at time 0 is excluded from
summary, if $warmup$ = 2 the generations at times 0 and 1 are excluded
and so on. If $warmup$ = NULL all generations are considered for summary
statistics. Possible values are NULL or positive integer (min=1,
max=50), default value = 1.\
The example below provides the averages of the quantities of interest
calculated for three simulations ($n\_sim$ = 3)

``` r
  # generate a summary for the simulated 'HostSwitch' object
  > summaryHostSwitch(sim1)

  pInd     3.68    4.17   4.65 4.64    5.11 5.57

  Summary of host switches by consumers:
                                          Mean Max
  Total events of dispersion:         29.67000  43
  Number of successful host switches: 12.33333  16
```

The `testHostSwitch` function measures if there is a significant
difference between the means of three simulated quantities of two
HostSwitch objects ($simulated\_quantities1$ and
$simulated\_quantities2$). The argument $parameter$ selects the quantity
to compare, i.e. \"j\" (total number of dispersing events), \"s\" (total
number of successful host switch events), and \"d\" (distance between
the $pRes\_sim$ and $pRes\_new\_sim$ for the generations where a
successful host switch occurs, hereafter phenotype distance). The
argument $test$ defines the inferential statistic to be used, \"t\"
parametric (t-test) or \"w\" nonparametric (wilcoxon rank test). The
$warmup$ is defined as above, and the argument $plot$ provides the box
plot of the results based on the $ggplot$ function. When comparing
quantities, the user needs to take into account all the arguments
provided to the function `simHostSwitch`, including the number of
simulations ($n\_sim$). A warning message will be produced if $n\_sim$=1
for both HostSwitch objects. The following code generates another
HostSwitch object (sim2), with $mig$ = 0.9 and default values for the
others arguments. We compare the quantities from the objects sim1 and
sim2 using `testHostSwitch`:

``` r
  
  > sim2 <- simHostSwitch(mig = 0.9, n_sim= 3, seed = 3)
  
  # compare the average values of the simulated quantities ("j", "s", "d") saved in the
  # objects sim1 and sim2
  > testHostSwitch(simulated_quantities1 = sim1, simulated_quantities2 = sim2, 
    parameter = "j", test = "t", warmup = NULL, plot = FALSE)
    An object of class testHostSwitch
    Test result comparing 2 HostSwitch simulations using Welch Two Sample t-test 
    t: 2.74044, df:2.278635, p.value:0.09663877
    
  > testHostSwitch(simulated_quantities1 = sim1, simulated_quantities2 = sim2,
    parameter = "s", test = "t", warmup = NULL, plot = FALSE)
    An object of class testHostSwitch
    Test result comparing 2 HostSwitch simulations using Welch Two Sample t-test 
    t: 2.505218, df:3.545114, p.value:0.0743971
    
  > testHostSwitch(simulated_quantities1 = sim1, simulated_quantities2 = sim2,
    parameter = "d", test = "t", warmup = NULL, plot = FALSE)
    An object of class testHostSwitch
    Test result comparing 2 HostSwitch simulations using Welch Two Sample t-test 
    t: 1.271303, df:12.32786, p.value:0.2270841
  
```

The function returns the results of the test and the plot (if plot =
TRUE). In the example above there is no significant difference between
the two simulations, for all the simulated quantities (\"j\", \"s\",
\"d\").

The `plotHostSwitch` and `shinyHostSwitch` functions both allow
visualizing the results of a simulation, the first in the static plot
window of the R console and the second one in a dynamic interface. The
S3 method `plotHostSwitch` function graphically summarizes the simulated
output. The following code generates the plot for the third simulation
of the object sim1:

``` r
  > plotHostSwitch(HostSwitch_simulated_quantities = sim1, n_sim = 3)
```

The function `shinyHostSwitch` relies on the package
[*shiny*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=shiny), and by running the
code:

``` r
  > shinyHostSwitch()
```

a popup window displays the plot for a simulation run with default
values. The panel on the left includes slider bars for each argument of
`simHostSwitch` function. The plot reacts dynamically to user input
after pressing the Refresh simulation button.

# Usage scenarios

In this section, we provide examples of how the functions described
above can be applied to real data. We conducted a literature review with
the aim to select studies providing data about the life cycle parameters
of consumers interacting with their resources. The data were all
gathered from experimental settings and are related to three biotic
interaction models representing distinct fields of research: wildlife
ecology, agricultural pests, zoonotic pathogens. These data saved in the
$parli$ list object are included in the
[*HostSwitch*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=HostSwitch) package.
The list contains three matrices: \$Cephaloleia, \$Cacopsylla, and
\$SarsMers.

The complete code to reproduce results for the three biological
scenarios presented is provided as an R Markdown file in the
supplementary material for this article. Each scenario has two chunks of
code: one to run the test and one to create plots. Using the Knit button
in RStudio the results will be embedded beneath the code chunk in a .pdf
document (see supplementary material for an example).

## *Cephaloleia* - Zingeriberales (wildlife ecology)

Beetle species in the genus *Cephaloleia* (Coleoptera, Chrysomelidae,
Cassidinae) are herbivorous insects feeding on monocots within the order
Zingiberales and are known to be strictly co-evolved with their host
plants during the last 35-60 Million years in the Neotropical region.
This herbivore-plant association has been used earlier as a good model
to test macroevolutionary hypotheses of host use and to investigate
drivers of the evolution of the biological interactions
[@garcia2011experimental; @schmitt2013notes]. Previous studies revealed
host switch events in at least 7 species of *Cephaloleia* beetles in
Costa Rica, and detailed information of life-cycle parameters have been
reported [@garcia2011experimental; @garcia2010larval].

To inform our model, we used data on net reproduction rate for two
species of *Cephaloleia* (the generalist *C. belti* and the specialist
*C. placida*) provided by @garcia2011experimental. On their native host
plants, *C. belti* showed the highest net reproduction rate ($b$ = 4.6)
and *C. placida* the lowest ($b$ = 1.4) (see the lower value of the
parameter for each species from Table 7 in @garcia2011experimental).
Suppose we are interested in simulating the host switch events of the
two closely related taxa with different diet breadth, *C. belti* and *C.
placida*. We may want to test the hypothesis that a higher net
reproduction rate significantly increases the number of dispersion
events and the successful colonization of new hosts (number of host
switches). In this example, we simulated the dispersion and host switch
events of the generalist *C. belti* (known to be associated with
different families in Zingeriberales in Costa Rica) and the specialist
*C. placida* (hosted by *Renealmia alpinia*). For each species, the
simulation was run for 200 generations, K=1000 (carrying capacity not
being a limiting factor), and 1000 runs. Because the other parameters,
namely $pRes\_min$, $pRes\_max$, $sd$ (standard deviation of mutation),
and sigma (standard deviation of survival), are not available in the
literature for the two species the default values of the `simHostSwitch`
function were used. The effect of the net reproduction rate on the
simulated quantities (dispersion events $j$, successful host switches
$s$, and distance between current and novel Resource $d$) was tested,
along with the assumption that $b$ does not vary switching from the
current to the novel resource across generations. We also tested the
influence of the two parameters $mig$ (migration probability) and
$jump\_back$ (possibility to jump back to the original host) with the
assumption that they may rapidly vary under different ecological
conditions. We arbitrarily set the variation for $mig$ as low = 0.01 or
high = 0.1, and for $jump\_back$ as \"no\" or \"yes\". All possible
combinations between the species were compared
(Table [2](#tab:comparison1)).

:::

The difference between the average values of $j$, $s$, and $d$ was
evaluated with the paired t-test using the function `testHostSwitch`.
The null hypothesis is that the pairwise difference between the two
average values is equal. The code chunk \"Scenario 1:
Cephaloleia-Zingeriberales (wildlife ecology)\" (supplementary material)
uses the data in $parli\$Cephaloleia$ object to generate a large list
(simResult) with eight `simHostSwitch` objects, 4 for *C. belti*
(hereafter Cb) and 4 for *C. placida* (Cp). The objects differ for the
combinations of the parameters described above. The dataframe
$testResult.Cephaloleia$ saves the p-values for all the 16 combinations
and all simulation objects defined by the user using the vector
\"simulations\". All the objects are saved in the Global environment and
a reshaped table with p-values of the t-test is visualized on the
console and in Table [2](#tab:comparison1). The code chunk \"Plot for
Cephaloleia\" generates 3 plots for each of the tested quantities ($j$,
$s$, and $d$); Figure [2](#figure:Boxplots1) shows example box plots for
the first comparison.

![Figure 2: Comparisons between the three simulated quantities (A- total
number of dispersing events $j$, B- total number of successful host
switches $s$, and C- phenotype distance $d$) calculated for populations
of *Cephaloleia placida* and *C. belti*. The populations are
characterized by a low migration value and no possibility to jump back
to the original Resource. The simulated quantities are calculated using
the `simHostSwitch` function. The quantity $d$ is defined as the
difference between the phenotype of current and new Resource for
generations where a successful host switch occurs. Each box plot depicts
the distribution of the simulated quantities. For plot A and B, N
represents the number of simulations (200). For plot C, N represents the
total number of successful host switches calculated for 200

The results in Table [2](#tab:comparison1) and
Figure [2](#figure:Boxplots1) show that the differences in the average
number of dispersion and host switch events between *C. belti* and *C.
placida* is significant, regardless of the values of probability of
migration and the possibility to jump back to the old host. *Cephaloleia
belti* shows higher values of $j$ and $s$, this means that a four times
higher net reproduction rate drives a higher probability of migration
and successful host switches over time. As far as the distance between
current and novel Resources is concerned, only seven out of 16
combinations showed a non-significant difference, all of them including
*C. belti* with high probability of migration.

## *Cacopsylla melanoneura* - Rosaceae (agricultural pests)

The hemipteran insect *Cacopsylla melanoneura* (Hemiptera, Psyllidae) is
one of the known vectors of phytoplasmas, plant pathogenic bacteria in
Class Mollicutes, and their association with host plants in the family
of Rosaceae is known to be restricted to Central Europe
[@apple_proliferation_2020]. This group of pathogens is associated with
severe diseases of orchards, including apple proliferation disease
associated with '*Candidatus* (*Ca.*) Phytoplasma (P.) mali', pear
decline ('*Ca.* P. pyri') and European stone fruit yellows ('*Ca.* P.
prunorum'). The epidemiology of this vector-borne pathogen closely
depends on the range of host plants that may serve as inoculum sources
(reservoirs), and on the specific relationship between insect vectors
and plants. Although *C. melanoneura* has been reported as a competent
vector of '*Ca.* P. mali' in Italy [@tedeschi2002population], the degree
of preference for natural host plants may vary across countries
affecting its role in phytoplasma spread, which is still largely unclear
[@malagnini2010study]. Earlier investigations aimed to characterize
aspects of its autoecology, such as life cycle, cryptic genetic
variation, and habitat preference that may influence the associations
with host plants [@malagnini2013ecological]. *Cacopsylla melanoneura* is
known to be an oligophagous insect on hawthorn (*Crataegus* spp.), apple
(*Malus* spp.), medlar (*Mespilus germanica*) and pear (*Pyrus
communis*), and coniferous species are used as shelter plants during the
winter
[@jackson1990cold; @lal1934biology; @ossiannilsson1992psylloidea].
Moreover, the existence of *C. melanoneura* host races which show a
morphological and genetic differentiation along with specific
association with different host plants (apple or hawthorn) is likely in
populations from different geographical regions
[@lazarev1972psylla; @lazarev1974crimean; @lauterer1999results; @malagnini2013ecological].
Available evidence suggests that sympatric speciation via host shift may
be hypothesized. Even within the family Rosaceae only, the suite of host
plants of *C. melanoneura* may vary locally through host switches with
important consequences for the ecology of the insect vector and on the
epidemiology of the phytoplasma disease in cultivated orchard trees.

We used the large amount of data available to inform our model and to
compare two distinct populations of *C. melanoneura*: one adapted to
apple (hereafter CmA) and the other to hawthorn (CmH). We used the
experimental data provided by @malagnini2013ecological to calculate the
net reproduction rate of the populations of *C. melanoneura* using eqn 2
of @garcia2011experimental. The calculated value $b$ for CmA was about
twice (2.196) that of CmH (1.022). To calculate the probability of
migration $mig$ we used the results of a choice test carried out using a
dynamic olfactometer and provided in Figure 6 by @mayer2011chemically.
The values for $mig$ for CmA were retrieved from the experiment with a
population collected on apple tree that had a probability of 0.38 to
migrate on apple. For CmH the probability was 0.49. The standard
deviation of survival $sigma$ for CmA was retrieved by
@malagnini2010study (see Results section) reporting a value of 3.68, and
because no data was available for CmH we hypothesized a higher value 7
because hawthorn was reported as the ancestral host of *C. melanoneura*
[@jackson1990cold].

Suppose we are interested in simulating the host switch events of two
populations of *C. melanoneura* to novel closely related hosts in family
Rosaceae. We may want to test the hypothesis that twice a value of the
standard deviation of survival $sigma$ for CmH is more important than a
$b$ two times higher for CmA, driving a significant increase in the
number of dispersion events and more successful colonization of new
hosts (number of host switches) for the population CmH than CmA. The
parameter $mig$ (migration) was also provided from real data but only
slightly different between the two populations. Each simulation was run
with 200 generations, K=1000 (carrying capacity not being a limiting
factor), and 1000 runs. The parameters $pRes\_min$ and $pRes\_max$ are
not available in the literature and the default values were used. The
effect of combined $sigma$ and $b$ values on the simulated quantities
(dispersion events $j$, successful host switches $s$, and distance
between current and novel Resource $d$) was tested, along with the
assumption that both do not vary from the current to the novel Resource
across generations. We arbitrarily set the variation for standard
deviation of mutation $sd$ as low = 0.2 or high = 9, and for the
possibility to jump back to the original host $jump\_back$ as \"no\" or
\"yes\". All possible combinations between the populations were tested
(Table [3](#tab:comparison2)).

:::

We used the code chunk \"Scenario 2: Cacopsylla melanoneura-Rosaceae
(agricultural pests)\" (supplementary file) to test the difference
between the average values of simulated quantities (v$j$, $s$, and $d$)
for each combination of the populations of *C. melanoneura*. The null
hypothesis is that the pairwise difference between the two average
values is equal. The p-values of the t-test are reported in
(Table [3](#tab:comparison2). The code chunk \"Plot for Cacopsylla\"
generates three plots for each of the tested quantities and in
Figure [3](#figure:Boxplots2) an example for the first combination is
reported.

![Figure 3: Comparisons between the three simulated quantities (A- total
number of dispersing events $j$, B- total number of successful host

populations of *C. melanoneura* colonizing hawthorn. The populations are
characterized by a low mutation value and no possibility to jump back to
the original Resource. The simulated quantities are calculated using the
`simHostSwitch` function. The quantity $d$ is defined as the difference
between the phenotype of current and new Resource for generations where
a successful host switch occurs. Each box plot depicts the distribution
of the simulated quantities. For plot A and B, N represents the number
of simulations (200). For plot C, N represents the total number of
successful host switches calculated for 200
simulations.](figure 2usage.png){#figure:Boxplots2 width="100%"
alt="graphic without alt text"}

The results in Table [3](#tab:comparison2) show that the difference in
the average number of dispersion events is significant for all
combinations except the one where we allowed the population adapted to
hawthorn to come back to the original host and mutation is high for both
populations. The comparisons of host switch events were significant
except for three comparisons where mutation was set as high. When \"j\"
and \"s\" are significantly different, the population of CmA shows
higher values except for 5 combinations. These results suggest that a
two times higher net reproduction rate drives a higher probability of
successful host switch for CmA over time, masking the contribution of a
two times higher value of the standard deviation of survival. As far as
the distance between current and novel Resources is concerned, 11 out of
16 combinations showed a non-significant difference, but no specific
pattern has been revealed.

## *Sarbecovirus* spp. and *Merbacovirus* sp. (SARS-MERS) - Mammals (zoonotic pathogens)

The Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome - Corona Virus (SARS-CoV) is a
virus in the family *Coronaviridae* causing respiratory disease and was
first identified in humans at the end of February 2003 in China. The
Middle East Respiratory Syndrome - Corona Virus (MERS- CoV)
(*Coronaviridae*, *Merbacovirus* sp.) was first isolated from humans in
2012 in Saudi Arabia. Lately, a SARS-like coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2,
*Sarbecovirus* spp.) causing severe acute respiratory infections was
first identified in December 2019 in Wuhan (China). The emergence of
these viruses in humans appears to have been driven by stepping-stone
switches [@parrish2008cross; @rodriguez2020history], from bats to camels
to humans, in the case of MERS-CoV and from bats to pangolins (among the
others) to humans, in the case of SARS-CoV-2. As for many other human
pathogens, to anticipate the emergence of future outbreaks is critical
for appropriate measures to mitigate the consequences and costs
associated with epidemic events.

The usage scenario presented here offers an opportunity to apply our
model to the biological association between viruses and their mammalian
hosts. For this specific example we used the data provided by
@kim2021quantitative on viral dynamics of SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV, and
MERS-CoV in humans. In particular we selected the two coronaviruses
SARS-CoV-2 (hereafter Sars) and MERS-CoV (Mers), and two estimated
population parameters: Maximum rate constant for viral replication and
critical inhibition level (see Table 1 in @kim2021quantitative), in our
model corresponding to net reproduction rate ($b$, 4 for Sars and 1.46
for Mers) and standard deviation for survival ($sigma$, 0.77 for Sars
and 0.38 for Mers), respectively. The parameter $sigma$ was multiplied
by 10 to be adjusted to the argument requirement of the model. Suppose
we are interested in simulating host switch events of Sars and Mers
among closely related mammalian hosts. We may test the hypothesis that
higher net reproduction rate in combination with higher standard
deviation of survival (i.e. lower selection on the Resource)
significantly increases the number of dispersion events and successful
colonization of new hosts (number of host switches). For each virus, the
simulation was run with 200 generations, K=1000 (carrying capacity not
being a limiting factor), and 1000 runs. The parameter $sd$ (standard
deviation for mutation) was set at 0.002 for both viruses and was
derived by the values of the substitution rate (per site per year)
provided in Table 1 of @van2020emergence. The parameters $pRes\_min$,
$pRes\_max$ and $mig$ (migration) are not available in the literature
and the default values were used. The combined effect of the net
reproduction rate and survival probability on the simulated quantities
was tested, along with the assumption that both parameters do not vary
from the current to the novel Resource across generations. In this
example, we also tested the influence of low (0.01), medium (0.5) and
high (0.09) values of migration probability. The possibility to jump
back to the original host ($jump\_back$) was set to \"no\" assuming that
the virus is not able to come back from a new non-human mammal to human
within the same generation (Table [4](#tab:comparison3)).

The code chunk \"Scenario 3: Sarbecovirus sp. and Merbacovirus sp.
(SARS-MERS)-Mammals (zoonotic pathogens)\" (supplementary file) was used
to test the difference between the average values of simulated
quantities (v$j$, $s$, and $d$) for each combination of the two viruses.
The null hypothesis is that the pairwise difference between the two
average values is equal. The p-values for all the 9 combinations are
reported in (Table [4](#tab:comparison3)). The code chunk \"Plot for
SarsMers\" generates three plots for each of the tested quantities and
in Figure [4](#figure:Boxplots3) an example for the first combination is
reported.

![Figure 4: Comparisons between the three simulated quantities (A- total
number of dispersing events $j$, B- total number of successful host

of *Sarbecovirus* spp. and *Merbacovirus* sp. The populations are
characterized by a low probability of migration value. The simulated
quantities are calculated using the `simHostSwitch` function. The
quantity $d$ is defined as the difference between the phenotype of
current and new Resource for generations where a successful host switch
occurs. Each box plot depicts the distribution of the simulated
quantities. For plot A and B, N represents the number of simulations
(200). For plot C, N represents the total number of successful host

The results in Table [4](#tab:comparison3) and
Figure [4](#figure:Boxplots3) show that the differences in the average
number of dispersion and host switch events between Sars and Mers are
significant for all the simulations. The population of Sars shows higher
values of the estimated quantities, except when Mers has high migration
probability and Sars has low migration probability. This means that a
combination of higher net reproduction rate and lower selection on the
resource (both current and novel) drives to a higher probability of
successful host switches over time. As far as the distance between
current and novel resources is concerned, only 3 out of 9 combinations
showed a non-significant difference, and for all these Mers has a high
migration. In comparing the data from these coronaviruses, our purpose
was merely academic and we did not mean to provide any evidence for the
emergence of re-emergence of the present pandemic SARS-CoV-2 virus.
Nevertheless, modeling support may certainly be of value when informed
with detailed real data collected to address specific research
questions.

# Conclusion and future avenues

This paper introduces the R package
[*HostSwitch*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=HostSwitch) that
provides functions to simulate, plot and test the number of dispersion
and host switch events of a Consumer. It also measures phenotype
distance between a current and novel Resource in the case of a
successful host switch.
[*HostSwitch*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=HostSwitch) is based
on an earlier model published in FORTRAN [@araujo_understanding_2015].
The presented R-package offers several additional functions which
largely improve the previous mock-up model, and accommodates users who
want to simulate the ecological event of host-switching by using real
parameters collected from different types of symbiotic biological
associations. For example, the
[*HostSwitch*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=HostSwitch) package
can be used to test the hypothesis that host-switching happens more
often than expected by chance.

The [*HostSwitch*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=HostSwitch)
package was tested on real ecological Consumer-Resource interactions
using data from the literature. We are aware that the examples provided
above have several limitations, e.g., most of the arguments to inform
the model were not available in the literature and the default values
have been used. The reliability of the simulation on empirical data
depends on the quality of the parameters used to inform the model and on
their ecological significance. Users are therefore encouraged to set up
specific experiments to collect parameters from a \"host-switch
perspective\". The
[*HostSwitch*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=HostSwitch) package
will also continue to provide a theoretical foundation for understanding
the specific processes that drive host switch events. Lastly, it
represents a valuable user-friendly educational tool to facilitate
deeper understanding of ecological and evolutionary dynamics. As a
future avenue, we plan to extend the package to allow for the modeling
of microbe-mediated tritrophic interactions such as occur in
associations between pathogens, vectors and alternate hosts, e.g. in the
phytoplasma pathosystem consisting of an insect vector, crop plants, and
a pathogen that is able to manipulate its vector (Consumer) and host
(Resource).

Albeit, the present package is intended for researchers in the broad
field of biology who study consumer-host associations, we encourage
users from other research areas to evaluate if the flowchart presented
in Figure 1 may fit and be co-opted by other biological phenomena.
