title: We Need Trustworthy R Packages
abstract: There is a need for rigorous software engineering in R packages, and there
  is a need for new research to bridge scientific computing with more traditional
  computing. Automated tools, interdisciplinary graduate courses, code reviews, and
  a welcoming developer community will continue to democratize best practices. Democratized
  software engineering will improve the quality, correctness, and integrity of scientific
  software, and by extension, the disciplines that rely on it.
