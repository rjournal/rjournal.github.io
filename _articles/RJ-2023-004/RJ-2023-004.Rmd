title: 'remap: Regionalized Models with Spatially Smooth Predictions'
abstract: Traditional spatial modeling approaches assume that data are second-order
  stationary, which is rarely true over large geographical areas. A simple way to
  model nonstationary data is to partition the space and build models for each region
  in the partition. This has the side effect of creating discontinuities in the prediction
  surface at region borders. The regional border smoothing approach ensures continuous
  predictions by using a weighted average of predictions from regional models. The
  R package remap is an implementation of regional border smoothing that builds a
  collection of spatial models. Special consideration is given to distance calculations
  that make remap package scalable to large problems. Using the remap package, as
  opposed to global spatial models, results in improved prediction accuracy on test
  data. These accuracy improvements, coupled with their computational feasibility,
  illustrate the efficacy of the remap approach to modeling nonstationary data.
