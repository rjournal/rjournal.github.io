title: Changes to grid for R 3.0.0
abstract: From R 3.0.0, there is a new recommended way to develop new grob classes
  in grid. In a nutshell, two new “hook” functions, makeContext() and makeContent()
  have been added to grid to provide an alternative to the existing hook functions
  preDrawDetails(), drawDetails(), and postDrawDetails(). There is also a new function
  called grid.force(). This article discusses why these changes have been made, provides
  a simple demonstration of the use of the new functions, and discusses some of the
  implications for packages that build on grid.
