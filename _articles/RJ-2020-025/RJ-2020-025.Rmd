title: 'CopulaCenR: Copula based Regression Models for Bivariate Censored Data in
  R'
abstract: Bivariate time-to-event data frequently arise in research areas such as
  clinical trials and epidemiological studies, where the occurrence of two events
  are correlated. In many cases, the exact event times are unknown due to censoring.
  The copula model is a popular approach for modeling correlated bivariate censored
  data, in which the two marginal distributions and the between margin dependence
  are modeled separately. This article presents the R package CopulaCenR, which is
  designed for modeling and testing bivariate data under right or (general) interval
  censoring in a regression setting. It provides a variety of Archimedean copula functions
  including a flexible two-parameter copula and different types of regression models
  (parametric and semiparametric) for marginal distributions. In particular, it implements
  a semiparametric transformation model for the margins with proportional hazards
  and proportional odds models being its special cases. The numerical optimization
  is based on a novel two-step algorithm. For the regression parameters, three likelihood-based
  tests (Wald, generalized score and likelihood ratio tests) are also provided. We
  use two real data examples to illustrate the key functions in CopulaCenR.
