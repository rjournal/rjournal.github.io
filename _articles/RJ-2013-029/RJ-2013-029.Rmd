title: Dynamic Parallelization of R Functions
abstract: R offers several extension packages that allow it to perform parallel computations.
  These operate on fixed points in the program flow and make it difficult to deal
  with nested parallelism and to organize parallelism in complex computations in general.
  In this article we discuss, first, of how to detect parallelism in functions, and
  second, how to minimize user intervention in that process. We present a solution
  that requires minimal code changes and enables to flexibly and dynamically choose
  the degree of parallelization in the resulting computation. An implementation is
  provided by the R package parallelize.dynamic and practical issues are discussed
  with the help of examples.
