title: 'spMC: Modelling Spatial Random Fields with Continuous Lag Markov Chains'
abstract: Currently, a part of the R statistical software is developed in order to
  deal with spatial models. More specifically, some available packages allow the user
  to analyse categorical spatial random patterns. However, only the spMC package considers
  a viewpoint based on transition probabilities between locations. Through the use
  of this package it is possible to analyse the spatial variability of data, make
  inference, predict and simulate the categorical classes in unobserved sites. An
  example is presented by analysing the well-known Swiss Jura data set.
