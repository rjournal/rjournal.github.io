Dear Editors,
\bigskip

We are writing to submit our article titled "SIHR: Statistical Inference in High-Dimensional Linear and Logistic Regression Models," authored by Prabrisha Rakshit, Zhenyu Wang, Tony Cai, and Zijian Guo, for publication in the R Journal.

Uncertain quantification is a critical and challenging problem in high-dimensional statistics, including confidence interval construction and hypothesis testing. In the submitted paper, we have comprehensively introduced the `SIHR` package, providing the tool for a broad class of high-dimensional uncertainty quantification problems.

Our package `SIHR` is based on the debiasing inference methods and is designed to address a wide range of inference problems in high-dimensional generalized linear models for both continuous and binary outcomes. We describe the methodologies for each inference problem and the underlying ideas behind these methodologies. Additionally, we provide a thorough overview of the functions included in the package and offer a series of examples to help users learn how to use the `SIHR` package. We further illustrate the usage of `SIHR` with two real data applications.

Compared to other R packages, our package is the first to systematically handle a comprehensive class of low-dimensional objectives (e.g., linear and quadratic transformations of regression vectors). Additionally, our package is computationally more efficient than existing R packages.
