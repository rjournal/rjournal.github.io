title: 'LP Algorithms for Portfolio Optimization: The PortfolioOptim Package'
abstract: 'The paper describes two algorithms for financial portfolio optimization
  with the following risk measures: CVaR, MAD, LSAD and dispersion CVaR. These algorithms
  can be applied to discrete distributions of asset returns since then the optimization
  problems can be reduced to linear programs. The first algorithm solves a simple
  recourse problem as described by Haneveld using Benders de composition method. The
  second algorithm finds an optimal portfolio with the smallest distance to a given
  benchmark portfolio and is an adaptation of the least norm solution (called also
  normal solution) of linear programs due to Zhao and Li. The algorithms are implemented
  in R in the package PortfolioOptim.'
