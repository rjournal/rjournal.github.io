title: 'jomo: A Flexible Package for Two-level Joint Modelling Multiple Imputation'
abstract: Multiple imputation is a tool for parameter estimation and inference with
  partially observed data, which is used increasingly widely in medical and social
  research. When the data to be imputed are correlated or have a multilevel structure
  — repeated observations on patients, school children nested in classes within schools
  within educational districts — the imputation model needs to include this structure.
  Here we introduce our joint modelling package for multiple imputation of multilevel
  data, jomo, which uses a multivariate normal model fitted by Markov Chain Monte
  Carlo (MCMC). Compared to previous packages for multilevel imputation, e.g. pan,
  jomo adds the facility to (i) handle and impute categorical variables using a latent
  normal structure, (ii) impute level-2 variables, and (iii) allow for cluster-specific
  covariance matrices, including the option to give them an inverse-Wishart distribution
  at level 2. The package uses C routines to speed up the computations and has been
  extensively validated in simulation studies both by ourselves and others.
