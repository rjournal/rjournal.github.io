title: 'mistr: A Computational Framework for Mixture and Composite Distributions'
abstract: Finite mixtures and composite distributions allow to model the probabilistic
  representation of data with more generality than simple distributions and are useful
  to consider in a wide range of applications. The R package mistr provides an extensible
  computational framework for creating, transforming, and evaluating these models,
  together with multiple methods for their visualization and description. In this
  paper we present the main computational framework of the package and illustrate
  its application. In addition, we provide and show functions for data modeling using
  two specific composite distributions as well as a numerical example where a composite
  distribution is estimated to describe the log-returns of selected stocks.
