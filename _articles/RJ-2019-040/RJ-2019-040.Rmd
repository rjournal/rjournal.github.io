title: 'unival: An FA-based R Package For Assessing Essential Unidimensionality Using
  External Validity Information'
abstract: The *unival* package is designed to help researchers decide between unidimensional
  and correlated-factors solutions in the factor analysis of psychometric measures.
  The novelty of the approach is its use of *external* information, in which multiple
  factor scores and general factor scores are related to relevant external variables
  or criteria. The *unival* package's implementation comes from a series of procedures
  put forward by @FerrandoLorenzo-Seva:2019 and new methodological developments proposed
  in this article. We assess models fitted using *unival* by means of a simulation
  study extending the results obtained in the original proposal. Its usefulness is
  also assessed through a real-world data example. Based on these results, we conclude
  *unival* is a valuable tool for use in applications in which the dimensionality
  of an item set is to be assessed.

# Introduction

Assessing the dimensionality of a set of items is one of the central
purposes of psychometric factor analysis (FA) applications. At present,
both the exploratory (EFA) and the confirmatory (CFA) models can be
considered to be fully developed structural equation models
[@FerrandoLorenzo-Seva:2017]. So, in principle, dimensionality can be
rigorously assessed by using the wide array of goodness-of-fit
procedures available for structural models in general. However, it is
becoming increasingly clear that reliance on goodness-of-fit alone is
not the way to judge the most appropriate dimensionality for studying a
particular set of item scores [@Rodriguez:2016a; @Rodriguez:2016b].

The problem noted above is particularly noticeable in instruments
designed to measure a single trait. In the vast majority of cases, item
scores derived from these instruments fail to meet the strict
unidimensionality criteria required by Spearman's model. This failure,
in turn, led to the proposal of multiple correlated-factor solutions as
the most appropriate structure for them
[@FerrandoLorenzo-Seva:2018a; @FerrandoLorenzo-Seva:2018b; @Furnham:1990; @Reise:2013; @Reise:2015].
However, most instruments designed to be unidimensional do, in fact,
yield data compatible with an essentially unidimensional solution
[@FloydWidaman:1995; @Reise:2013; @Reise:2015]. When this is the case,
treating the item scores as multidimensional has several undesirable
consequences, mainly, (a) lack of clarity in the interpretation and
unnecessary theoretical complexities, and (b) weakened factor score
estimates that do not allow accurate individual measurement
[@FerrandoLorenzo-Seva:2018a; @FerrandoLorenzo-Seva:2018b; @Furnham:1990; @Reise:2013; @Reise:2015].
Indeed, treating clearly multidimensional scores as unidimensional also
has such negative consequences as biased item parameter estimates, loss
of information, and factor score estimates that cannot be univocally
interpreted [see @FerrandoLorenzo-Seva:2018a; @Reise:2013].

In recent years, several indices and criteria have been proposed to
assess dimensionality using different perspectives of model
appropriateness. These developments, in turn, have been integrated in
comprehensive proposals addressing the dimensionality issue from
multi-faceted views including, but are not limited to, standard
goodness-of-fit results
[@FerrandoLorenzo-Seva:2018a; @RaykovMarcoulides:2018; @Rodriguez:2016a; @Rodriguez:2016b].
It is worth noting these approaches generally reflect a trend in which
the measurement part of the FA model is again relevant [e.g.
@Curran:2018]. Considering the ultimate aim of most psychometric
measures is individual measurement, the scoring stage of the FA should
be expected to be the most important part of it
[@FerrandoLorenzo-Seva:2018a; @FerrandoLorenzo-Seva:2018b]. Furthermore,
if this view is adopted, a basic criterion for deciding if a given FA
solution is appropriate is the extent to which the score estimates
derived from this solution are strong, reliable, determinate, unbiased,
and clearly interpretable
[@FerrandoLorenzo-Seva:2018a; @Beauducel:2016; @Furnham:1990; @Reise:2013; @Reise:2015].
Procedures explicitly based on the quality of the score estimates are
already available in widely used programs such as FACTOR
[@Lorenzo-SevaFerrando:2013], and more sophisticated procedures based on
@Haberman:2008's ([-@Haberman:2008]) added-value principle have been
also proposed [@FerrandoLorenzo-Seva:2018b].

A common characteristic of all the proposals discussed so far is their
use of *internal* information from the data exclusively: that is to say,
the information provided by the item scores of the measure under study.
In contrast, the approach implemented here is based on *external*
sources of information: that is to say, the information provided by the
relations between the factor score estimates derived from a given
solution and relevant external variables or criteria. This additional
information is a valuable complementary tool that can help reach a
decision on whether the instrument under scrutiny is essentially
unidimensional or truly multidimensional.

The present article aims to introduce *unival*, a new contributed R
package implementing a recently proposed external procedure of the type
described above [@FerrandoLorenzo-Seva:2019]. It also discusses new
methodological developments allowing the procedure to be used in a wider
range of situations than those considered in the original proposal. The
rest of the article is organized as follows. First, we provide a summary
the needed theoretical bases, and explain the new methodological
contributions. Then, we give details about the package and how to use
it. Finally, we assess the functioning of the program and the new
developments proposed here with a simulation study and give real-world
data examples.

# Theoretical foundations: A review

Consider two alternative FA solutions -- unidimensional and
multiple-correlated -- which are fitted to a set of item scores. Suppose
further that both solutions are found to be acceptable by internal
criteria, a situation which is quite usual in applications [e.g.
@FerrandoNavarro-Gonzalez:2018]. The aim of the proposal summarized here
is to assess which of the competing solutions is more appropriate in
terms of external validity.

The null hypothesis in the proposal assumes (a) there is a general
common factor running through the entire set of items, and (b) all the
relations between the multiple factors and the relevant external
variables are mediated by the general factor. In this case, the
unidimensional solution is the most appropriate in terms of validity. At
this point we note the proposal is intended to work on a
variable-by-variable basis. So, it will be summarized using a single
external variable.

The null hypothesis above can be described by using a second-order FA
schema as follows. Assumption (a) above implies the correlated factors
in the multiple solution, which we shall denote from now on as primary
factors, behave as indicators of a single general factor. Assumption (b)
implies the only parts of the primary factor not accounted for by the
general factor are unrelated to the external variable.

The implications of the null model in terms of validity relations are
considered in two facets: differential and incremental. In differential
validity terms, the score estimates derived from the primary factors are
expected to be related to the external variable in the same way as they
are related to the general factor. As for incremental validity, the
implications of the null model are the prediction of the external
variable which is made from the single (general) factor score estimates
cannot be improved upon by using the primary factor score estimates in a
multiple regression schema.

Let $\hat{\theta}_{ik}$ be the factor-score estimate of individual $i$
in the $k$ primary factor, and let $\theta_{ik}$ be the corresponding
true factor score. We write
$$\label{EQ1}
\hat{\theta}_{ik} = \theta_{ik} + \varepsilon_{ik} ,   (\#eq:EQ1)$$
where $\varepsilon_{ik}$ denotes the measurement error. The true scores
${\theta}_{k}$ are assumed to be distributed with zero expectation and
unit variance. It is further assumed $\hat{\theta}_{ik}$ is
conditionally unbiased (i.e.
$E(\hat{\theta}_{ik}|\theta_{ik})=\theta_{ik}$, which implies the
measurement errors are uncorrelated with the true trait levels. It then
follows the squared correlation between $\hat{\theta}_{k}$ and
$\theta_{k}$ is
$$\label{EQ2}
\rho_{(\hat{\theta}_{k}, \theta_{k})} = \frac{Var(\theta_{k})}{Var(\hat{\theta}_{k})} = \frac{1}{1+Var(\varepsilon_{k})} = \frac{1}{1+E(Var(\varepsilon_{ik}|\theta_{ik}))} = \rho_{(\hat{\theta}_{k},\hat{\theta}_{k})}   (\#eq:EQ2)$$
which is taken as the marginal reliability of the factor score estimates
[see @FerrandoLorenzo-Seva:2018b]. Denote now by $y$ the external
variable or criterion also assumed to be scaled with zero mean and unit
variance and by $\rho_{(\hat{\theta}_{k},y)}$ the correlation between
the $k_{th}$ factor score estimates and the criterion (i.e. the raw
validity coefficient). From the results above it follows that the
disattenuated correlation between the estimated primary factor scores
and the criterion
$$\label{EQ3}
\hat{\rho}_{(\theta_{k},y)} = \frac{\rho_{(\hat{\theta}_{k},y)}}{\sqrt{\rho_{(\hat{\theta}_{k},\hat{\theta}_{k})}}}   (\#eq:EQ3)$$
is an unbiased estimate of the corresponding correlation between the
true primary scores and the criterion (i.e. the true validity
coefficient). Now let $\gamma_{kg}$ be the loading of the $k$ primary
factor on the general factor (i.e. the second-order loading). If the
null model is correct, the following result should hold
$$\label{EQ4}
\frac{\hat{\rho}(\theta_{1},y)}{\gamma_{1g}} = \cdots \frac{\hat{\rho}(\theta_{k},y)}{\gamma_{kg}} = \cdots \frac{\hat{\rho}(\theta_{q},y)}{\gamma_{qg}} .   (\#eq:EQ4)$$

In words, equation \@ref(eq:EQ4) means the primary factors relate to the
external variable in the same proportion to how they relate to the
general factor. So, after correcting for this proportionality, the
corrected indices should all be equal (i.e. no differential validity).
To test this result, *unival* uses the following schema. First, it
provides the Bootstrap-based confidence interval for each of the scaled
coefficients in equation \@ref(eq:EQ4). Second, the median value of the
scaled coefficients is obtained, and the most extreme scaled value is
subtracted from the median. Next, a confidence interval for this
difference is obtained via Bootstrap resampling, and a check is made to
see whether the zero value falls within this interval or not. This
second procedure provides a single difference statistic regardless of
the number of primary factors.

If the equality test is found not tenable, then the alternative
explanation (i.e. differential validity) is the unique parts of the
primary factors are still differentially related to the external
variable beyond the relations that are mediated by the general factor.
If this were so, validity information would be lost if the
unidimensional model was chosen instead of the multiple model.

We turn now to incremental validity. The starting point of the proposal
by [@FerrandoLorenzo-Seva:2019] was based on two results. First, the
score estimates on the general factor are a linear composite of the
score estimates on the primary factors in which the weights aim to
maximize the accuracy of the general scores. And second, the
multiple-regression composite, which is also based on the primary factor
score estimates, has weights aimed at maximizing the correlation with
the external variable. In a truly unidimensional solution both sets of
weights are expected to be proportional, and the predictive power of the
general score estimates and the primary score estimates to be the same.
More in detail, [@FerrandoLorenzo-Seva:2019] proposed correcting the
primary factor score estimates for measurement error, and then obtained
single and multiple corrected correlation estimates whose expected
values were the same under the null model above. Under the alternative
hypothesis, on the other hand, the corrected multiple correlation
(denoted by $R_c$ ) was expected to be larger than the single
correlation based on the general scores (denoted by
$\hat{\rho}_{\hat{\theta}_{g}y}$). The procedure implemented in *unival*
for testing the null hypothesis of no incremental validity is to compute
the difference $R_c - \hat{\rho}_{\hat{\theta}_{g}y}$, obtain the
Bootstrap confidence interval for this difference, and check whether the
zero value falls within the interval or not. If the null hypothesis is
rejected, the alternative explanation (i.e. incremental validity) is the
primary score estimates contain additional information allowing the
multiple prediction based on them to be significantly better than the
prediction based only on the general scores.

# New methodological contributions

The present article extends the original proposal by
[@FerrandoLorenzo-Seva:2019] in two directions. First, the procedure can
now be correctly used with types of score estimate other than those
considered initially. Second, an approximate procedure is proposed for
testing essential unidimensionality against a solution in only two
correlated factors.

As for the first point, the original proposal is based on factor score
estimates behaving according to the assumptions derived from equation
\@ref(eq:EQ1). Appropriate scores of this type are mainly
maximum-likelihood (ML) scores, which, in the linear FA model are known
as @Bartlett:1937's ([-@Bartlett:1937]) scores [see
@FerrandoLorenzo-Seva:2018b for a discussion]. However, other types of
scores are in common use in FA applications. In particular, Bayes
Expected-A-Posteriori (EAP) scores have a series of practical advantages
in nonlinear FA applications [@BockMislevy:1982] and are, possibly, the
most commonly used scoring schema for this type of solution. EAP scores,
however, are always inwardly biased (i.e. regressed towards the mean)
and so do not fulfill the basic assumptions on which the original
procedure was based.

Simple adaptations and corrections of the existing procedures can be
obtained by viewing the EAP scores as the result of shrinking the ML
scores towards the zero population mean so the shrinkage factor is the
marginal reliability [@BockMislevy:1982]. By using this concept in the
assessment of differential validity, it follows that the expected value
of the raw correlation between the EAP score estimates for the $k$
factor and $y$ is given by
$$\label{EQ5}
E(r_{(\hat{\theta}_{kEAP},y)}) = \frac{\rho_{(\theta_{k},y)}}{\sqrt{1+E(Var(\varepsilon_{ik}|\theta_{ik}))}}   (\#eq:EQ5)$$
Indeed, the conditional variances in the denominator of \@ref(eq:EQ5)
are not known, because they are based on the ML unbiased estimates.
However, as the number of items increases, the posterior distribution
approaches normality [@ChangStout:1993], and the posterior standard
deviation (PSD) associated with the EAP estimate becomes equivalent to
an asymptotic standard error [@BockMislevy:1982]. So, for factors
defined, say, by 8 or more items, the following correction is expected
to lead to appropriate disattenuated validity coefficients
$$\label{EQ6}
\hat{\rho}_{(\theta_{k},y)} = r_{(\hat{\theta}_{kEAP},y)}\sqrt{1+E(PSD^{2}(\theta_{ik}))} .   (\#eq:EQ6)$$

For very short item sets, the PSDs can be noticeably smaller than the
standard errors because of the additional information contributed by the
prior. The strategy proposed in this case is first to approximate the
amounts of information from the PSDs by using the approximate relation
[@WainerMislevy:2000 p. 74]
$$\label{EQ7}
PSD(\hat{\theta}) \cong \frac{1}{\sqrt{I(\hat{\theta}+1)}}   (\#eq:EQ7)$$
and then to use the modified correction
$$\label{EQ8}
\hat{\rho}_{(\theta_{k},y)} = r_{(\hat{\theta}_{kEAP},y)}\sqrt{1+E(\frac{1}{I(\hat{\theta}_{ik})})}.   (\#eq:EQ8)$$
Once the EAP-based disattenuated validity estimates have been obtained,
they are used in the contrast \@ref(eq:EQ4) in the same way as those
derived from the ML scores.

We turn now to incremental validity. If EAP scores are used, the
corrected estimate based on the general factor score estimates (denoted
by $\hat{\rho}_{\hat{\theta}_{g}y}$) can be obtained as
$$\label{EQ9}
\hat{\rho}_{(\theta_{g},y)} = r_{(\hat{\theta}_{gEAP},y)} s_{(\hat{\theta}_{gEAP})} (1+E(\frac{1}{I(\hat{\theta}_{ik})}))   (\#eq:EQ9)$$
or, if the PSD approximation is used
$$\label{EQ10}
\hat{\rho}_{(\theta_{g},y)} = r_{(\hat{\theta}_{gEAP},y)} s_{(\hat{\theta}_{gEAP})} (1+E(PSD^{2}(\theta_{ik})))   (\#eq:EQ10)$$
where $s_{(\hat{\theta}_{gEAP})}$ is the standard deviation of the EAP
score estimates. As for the multiple estimate based on the primary
factor scores (denoted by $R_c$), only the covariances between the score
estimates and the criterion must be corrected when EAP estimates are
used instead of ML estimates [see @FerrandoLorenzo-Seva:2019]. EAP-based
unbiased estimates of these covariances can be obtained as
$$\label{EQ11}
\hat{C}ov_{\theta_{k},y} = Cov_{(\hat{\theta}_{kEAP},y)}[1+E(PSD^{2}(\theta_{ik}))]   (\#eq:EQ11)$$
or, by using the PSD-to-Information transformation if the number of
items is very small
$$\label{EQ12}
\hat{C}ov_{\theta_{k},y} = Cov_{(\hat{\theta}_{kEAP},y)}[1+E(\frac{1}{I(\hat{\theta}_{ik})})].   (\#eq:EQ12)$$
Once the vector with the corrected covariances has been obtained, the
rest of the procedure is the same as when it is based on ML score
estimates.

Overall, the basis of the proposal so far discussed is to: (a) transform
the EAP scores so they (approximately) behave as ML scores; (b)
transform the PSDs so they will be equivalent to standard errors, and
(c) use the transformed results as input in the standard procedure. The
transformations are very simple, and the proposal is expected to work
well in practical applications, as the simulation study below suggests.
However, unstable or biased results might be obtained if the marginal
reliability estimate used to correct for shrinkage was itself unstable
or biased, or if the PSDs were directly used as if they were standard
errors and the contribution of the prior was substantial.

This approximate procedure is expected to be useful in practice, because
in many applications decisions must be taken about using one or two
common factors. The problem in this case is a second-order solution can
only be identified with three or more primary factors, and so, the
initial proposal cannot be used in the bidimensional case. An
approximate approach, however, can be used with the same rationale as in
the original procedure.

Consider two matrices of factor score estimates (either ML or EAP): an
$N\times2$ matrix containing the estimates obtained by fitting the
correlated two-factor solution, and an $N\times1$ matrix containing the
score estimates obtained by fitting the unidimensional (Spearman's)
model to the item scores. Next, consider the following regression
schemas in which the primary factor score estimates in the $N\times2$
matrix are corrected for measurement error. The first regression is of
the unidimensional score estimates on the corrected primary factor score
estimates. The second is the regression of the criterion on the same
corrected factor score estimates. Now, if the unidimensional solution is
essentially correct in terms of validity, then the profiles of weights
for predicting the general scores and those for predicting the criterion
are expected to be the same except for a proportionality constant.
Denoting by $\beta_g1$ and $\beta_g2$ the weights for predicting the
general scores from the corrected primary estimates, and by $\beta_y1$
and $\beta_y2$ the corresponding weights for predicting the criterion,
the contrast we propose for testing the null hypothesis no differential
validity is
$$\label{EQ13}
\frac{\beta_g1}{\beta_y1}=\frac{\beta_g2}{\beta_y2}   (\#eq:EQ13)$$
and is tested by using the same procedure as in equation \@ref(eq:EQ4).

With regards to incremental validity, the null hypothesis of essential
unidimensionality indicates both linear composites will predict the
criterion equally well. So, if we denote by $y'_g$ the composite based
on the $\beta_g1$ and $\beta_g2$ weights, and by $y'_y$ the composite
based on the $\beta_y1$ and $\beta_y2$ weights, the test of no
incremental validity is based on the contrast $r(y'_y,y)-r(y'_g,y)$, and
is tested in the same way as the standard contrast above.

# The *unival* package details

The current version of the
([*unival*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=unival)) package, which
is available through CRAN, contains one main function (and additional
internal functions) for implementing the procedures described in the
sections above. Further details on the theoretical bases of *unival* are
provided in [@FerrandoLorenzo-Seva:2019]. The function usage is as
follows.

``` r
unival(y, FP, fg, PHI, FA_model = 'Linear', type, SEP, SEG, relip, relig, 
percent = 90, display = TRUE)
```

-   `y`, the related external variable,
-   `FP`, the primary factor score estimates,
-   `fg`, the general or second-order factor score estimates. This
    argument is optional except when two primary factors are specified.
    In this case, second-order general score estimates cannot be
    obtained,
-   `PHI`, inter-factor correlation matrix,
-   `FA_model`, Which FA-model was used for calibration and scoring.
    Available options are: "Linear" (by default) or "Graded". The Graded
    option refers to the nonlinear FA model, in which item scores are
    treated as ordered-categorical variables, and includes binary scores
    as a specific case,
-   `type`, Which type of factor score estimates were used in FP and fg.
    The two available options are: "ML" or "EAP" scores. If not
    specified, ML estimation will be assumed,
-   `SEP`, Standard Errors (ML scores) or PSDs (EAP scores) for primary
    factor scores (only required when the "Graded" option is used),
-   `SEG`, Standard Errors (ML scores) or PSDs (EAP scores) for the
    general factor (only required when the "Graded" option is used),
-   `relip`, the marginal reliabilities of the primary factor scors
    estimates. Optional when three or more primary factors are
    specified; otherwise, the user should provide them,
-   `relig`, the marginal reliability of the general factor score
    estimates (optional).

The data provided should be a data frame or a numerical matrix for input
vectors and matrices, and numerical values for the arguments containing
a single element, like `relig`. The package imports three additional
packages: [*stats*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=stats) [@stats],
[*optimbase*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=optimbase) [@optimbase]
and [*psych*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=psych) [@psych], for
internal calculations (e.g. using the `fa` function from *psych* package
for performing the FA calibration).

Since the function requires the factor score estimates as input, these
estimates must be obtained from the raw data (i.e. the raw item scores)
before *unival* is used. We recommend the non-commercial FACTOR program
[@Lorenzo-SevaFerrando:2013] to obtain EAP estimates under the linear
and the graded FA model, or the
[*mirt*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=mirt) R package [@mirt] to
obtain ML and EAP estimates for both models. FACTOR also provides PSDs
for the EAP scores. Finally, both programs provide marginal reliability
estimates for the chosen factor scores.

# Simulation studies

The sensitivity of the procedures proposed in *unival*, for both
differential and incremental validity, depends on two main factors. The
first is the relative strength of the relations between (a) the general
factor scores and the external variables, and (b) the primary factor
scores and the external variable. The second is the extent of the
agreement between the relations between the unique parts of the primary
factor and the external variables and the relations between the primary
factor scores and the general factor. In summary, differential and
incremental validity are expected to be clearly detected when (a) the
primary factor scores are more strongly related to the external variable
than to the general scores, and (b) the relation between the unique
parts of the primary scores and the external variables is the opposite
of the relation between the corresponding factors and the general
factor. The opposite condition: (a) a general, dominant factor relates
more strongly to the external variable than the primary factors do; and
(b) a similar profile of relations in which the primary factors relate
to the external variable in the same way as they do with the general
factor, is very difficult to distinguish from the null hypothesis on
which the procedures are based.

@FerrandoLorenzo-Seva:2019 undertook a general simulation study in which
the determinants above were manipulated as independent variables
together with sample and model size. The study was based on the linear
FA model and Bartlett's ML score estimates. In this article we
replicated the study above but we discretized the continuous item
responses in five response categories (i.e. a typical Likert score) and
fitted the data using the non-linear FA model, thus treating the item
scores are ordered-categorical variables. In addition, the factor score
estimates were Bayes EAP scores. The present study, then, considers the
second potential FA model that can be used in *unival*, and assesses the
behavior of some of the new developments proposed in the article (the
use of Bayes scores instead of ML scores). Because the design and
conditions of the study were the same as those in
@FerrandoLorenzo-Seva:2019 the results are only summarized here. Details
and tables of results can be obtained from the authors. The results
generally agreed quite well with those obtained in the original study
except for the (unavoidable) loss of power due to categorization. More
in detail, in the study under the null model, neither spurious
differential nor incremental validity was detected in any of the
conditions.

In the studies in which the alternative model was correct, the following
results were obtained. Differential validity was correctly detected
except in the least favorable cells: dominant general-factor relations
and profile agreement. As for incremental validity, the loss of power
was more evident, and the procedure was less sensitive than in the
continuous case: when the profiles of relations agreed (i.e. when the
primary factors related to the external variable in the same way as they
related to the general factor), *unival* failed to detect the increments
in predictive power. This result, which, to a lesser extent, had already
been obtained in the original study, suggests the unique relations have
already been taken into account by the general factor score estimates.
So, the multiple-regression linear composite, with weights very similar
to those of the general factor score composite, does not substantially
add to the prediction of the external variable. Overall, then, the
results of the study suggest that in low-sensitivity conditions the
*unival* outcome leads to the unidimensional model being chosen even
when unique relations with the criterion do in fact exist. This choice,
however, is probably not a practical limitation, as in these conditions
the unidimensional model is more parsimonious and can explain the
validity relations well. Finally, as for the differences with the
previous study, the results suggest the *unival* procedures also work
well with the non-linear FA model and Bayes scores. However, as
expected, the categorization of the responses leads to a loss of
information which, in turn, results in a loss of sensitivity and power.
The most reasonable way to compensate for this loss would probably be to
use a larger number of items.

# Illustration with real data

The *unival* package contains an example dataset -- SAS3f -- which is a
matrix containing a criterion (marks on a final statistics exam), the
primary factor score estimates and the general factor score estimates in
a sample of 238 respondents. Both the primary and general scores were
EAP estimates obtained with the FACTOR [@Lorenzo-SevaFerrando:2013]
program.

The instrument under scrutiny is the Statistical Anxiety Scale [SAS,
@Vigil-Colet:2008] a 24-item instrument which was initially designed to
assess three related dimensions of anxiety: Examination anxiety (EA),
asking for help anxiety (AHA) and interpretation anxiety (IA). Previous
studies have obtained a clear solution in three highly-related factors
but have also found an essentially unidimensional solution is tenable.
So, the problem is to decide whether it is more appropriate to use only
single-factor scores measuring an overall dimension of statistical
anxiety or it is preferable (and more informative) to use the factor
score estimates in each of the three dimensions.

The only remaining argument for running *unival* with minimal input
requests is the inter-factor correlation matrix between the primary
factors. The example should be specified as follows:

``` r
> PHI = cbind(c(1,0.408,0.504),c(0.408,1,0.436),c(0.504,0.436,1))
> y = SAS3f[,1]
> FP = as.matrix(SAS3f[,2:4])
> fg = SAS3f[,5]
> unival(y = y, FP = FP, fg = fg, PHI = PHI, type = 'EAP')
```

The output from the above command is:

``` r

Overall, the results seem to be clear. In differential validity terms,
the confidence intervals for the first and second factors do not
overlap, and the zero value falls outside the maximum-difference
confidence interval. The interpretation is the primary factors relate to
the criterion in ways that cannot be predicted from their relations with
the general factor. More specifically, the first factor (AHA) seems to
be more strongly related, and the second factor (IA) more weakly related
to the criterion than could be predicted by their relations with the
general factor.

Incremental-validity results are also clear: the prediction of the
criterion based on the primary factor estimates clearly outperforms the
prediction that can be made from the general factor score estimates when
the regressions are corrected for measurement error. Note in particular
the zero value falls well outside the confidence interval of the
incremental validity estimate. To sum up, it is clear both information
and predictive power will be lost in this example if the single or
general factor score estimates are used as a summary of the estimates
based on the three anxiety factors. So, in terms of validity, the FA
solution in three correlated factors seems to be preferable.

# Concluding remarks

In the FA literature, several authors [e.g.
@CarminesZeller:1991; @FloydWidaman:1995; @Goldberg:1972; @MershonGorsuch:1988]
have pointed out the dimensionality of a set of item scores cannot be
decided solely in internal terms. Rather, the ultimate criterion for
judging what the most appropriate solution is should be how the scores
derived from this solution relate to relevant external variables. In
spite of this, however, external information is rarely used in FA-based
assessments. One explanation for this state of affairs is, indeed, the
difficulty of collecting additional relevant external measures. Apart
from this, however, clear and rigorous procedures on how to carry out
this assessment have only been proposed recently and, so far, have not
been implemented in non-commercial software. For this reason, we believe
*unival* is a useful additional tool for researchers who use FA in
psychometric applications.

*unival* has been designed to work with scores derived from an FA
solution rather than from raw item scores, and this has both
shortcomings and advantages. Thus, at the minimal-input level, potential
users of the program have to be able to carry out factor analyses with
other programs, and, particularly, to obtain factor score estimates.
Furthermore, they need to know what types of score have been computed by
the program. More advanced *unival* usages require users to know how to
obtain marginal reliability estimates for the factor scores or how to
perform second-order factor analysis. To sum up, the program is designed
for practitioners with some level of proficiency in FA. In principle,
this is a potential shortcoming but does not restrict the usefulness of
the program. As described above, all the input required by *unival* can
be obtained from non-commercial FA packages, some of which are also
quite user friendly.

The choice of the factor scores as input, on the other hand, makes the
program extremely flexible and versatile. *unival* can work with scores
derived from standard linear FA solutions or from non-linear solutions
(which include the multidimensional versions of the graded-response and
the two-parameter IRT models). Furthermore, users can choose to provide
the minimal input options, or can tailor the input by choosing the type
of marginal reliability estimate to be used in the error corrections or
the general factor score estimates on which the analyses are based
(second-order factor scores or scores derived from directly fitting the
unidimensional model). No matter how complex the model or input choices
are, however, the output provided by *unival* is extremely simple and
clear to interpret, as the illustrative example shows.
