title: 'unival: An FA-based R Package For Assessing Essential Unidimensionality Using
  External Validity Information'
abstract: The unival package is designed to help researchers decide between unidimensional
  and correlated factors solutions in the factor analysis of psychometric measures.
  The novelty of the approach is its use of external information, in which multiple
  factor scores and general factor scores are related to relevant external variables
  or criteria. The unival packageâ€™s implementation comes from a series of procedures
  put forward by Ferrando and Lorenzo-Seva (2019) and new methodological developments
  proposed in this article. We assess models fitted using unival by means of a simulation
  study extending the results obtained in the original proposal. Its usefulness is
  also assessed through a real-world data example. Based on these results, we conclude
  unival is a valuable tool for use in applications in which the dimensionality of
  an item set is to be assessed.
