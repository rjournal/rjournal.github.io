title: 'nmfgpu4R: GPU-Accelerated Computation of the Non-Negative Matrix Factorization
  (NMF) Using CUDA Capable Hardware'
abstract: In this work, a novel package called nmfgpu4R is presented, which offers
  the computation of Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) on Compute Unified Device
  Architecture (CUDA) platforms within the R environment. Benchmarks show a remarkable
  speed-up in terms of time per iteration by utilizing the parallelization capabilities
  of modern graphics cards. Therefore the application of NMF gets more attractive
  for real-world sized problems because the time to compute a factorization is reduced
  by an order of magnitude.
