title: The R in Robotics
abstract: 'The aim of this contribution is to connect two previously separated worlds:
  robotic application development with the Robot Operating System (ROS) and statistical
  programming with R. This fruitful combination becomes apparent especially in the
  analysis and visualization of sensory data. We therefore introduce a new language
  extension for ROS that allows to implement nodes in pure R. All relevant aspects
  are described in a step-by-step development of a common sensor data transformation
  node. This includes the reception of raw sensory data via the ROS network, message
  interpretation, bag-file analysis, transformation and visualization, as well as
  the transmission of newly generated messages back into the ROS network.'
