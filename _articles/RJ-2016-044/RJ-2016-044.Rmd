title: Escape from Boxland
abstract: A library of common geometric shapes can be used to train our brains for
  understanding data structure in high-dimensional Euclidean space. This article describes
  the methods for producing cubes, spheres, simplexes, and tori in multiple dimensions.
  It also describes new ways to define and generate high-dimensional tori. The algorithms
  are described, critical code chunks are given, and a large collection of generated
  data are provided. These are available in the R package geozoo, and selected movies
  and images, are available on the GeoZoo web site (http://schloerke.github.io/geozoo/).
