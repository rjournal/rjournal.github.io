title: Graphical Markov Models with Mixed Graphs in R
abstract: In this paper we provide a short tutorial illustrating the new functions
  in the package ggm that deal with ancestral, summary and ribbonless graphs. These
  are mixed graphs (containing three types of edges) that are important because they
  capture the modified independence structure after marginalisation over, and conditioning
  on, nodes of directed acyclic graphs. We provide functions to verify whether a mixed
  graph implies that A is independent of B given C for any disjoint sets of nodes
  and to generate maximal graphs inducing the same independence structure of non-maximal
  graphs. Finally, we provide functions to decide on the Markov equivalence of two
  graphs with the same node set but different types of edges.
