title: 'EMSaov: An R Package for the Analysis of Variance with the Expected Mean Squares
  and its Shiny Application'
abstract: EMSaov is a new R package that we developed to provide users with an analysis
  of variance table including the expected mean squares (EMS) for various types of
  experimental design. It is not easy to find the appropriate test, particularly the
  denominator for the F statistic that depends on the EMS, when some variables exhibit
  random effects or when we use a special experimental design such as nested design,
  repeated measures design, or split-plot design. With EMSaov, a user can easily find
  the F statistic denominator and can determine how to analyze the data when using
  a special experimental design. We also develop a web application with a GUI interface
  using the shiny package in R . We expect that our application can contribute to
  the efficient and easy analysis of experimental data.
