title: ' Individual-Level Modelling of Infectious Disease Data: EpiILM'
abstract: In this article we introduce the R package EpiILM, which provides tools
  for simulation from, and inference for, discrete-time individual-level models of
  infectious disease transmission proposed by Deardon et al. (2010). The inference
  is set in a Bayesian framework and is carried out via Metropolis Hastings Markov
  chain Monte Carlo (MCMC). For its fast implementation, key functions are coded in
  Fortran. Both spatial and contact network models are implemented in the package
  and can be set in either susceptible-infected (SI) or susceptible-infected-removed
  (SIR) compartmental frameworks. Use of the package is demonstrated through examples
  involving both simulated and real data.
