title: 'SMM: An R Package for Estimation and Simulation of Discrete-time semi-Markov
  Models'
abstract: 'Semi-Markov models, independently introduced by Lévy (1954), Smith (1955)
  and Takacs (1954), are a generalization of the well-known Markov models. For semi-Markov
  models, sojourn times can be arbitrarily distributed, while sojourn times of Markov
  models are constrained to be exponentially distributed (in continuous time) or geometrically
  distributed (in discrete time). The aim of this paper is to present the R package
  SMM, devoted to the simulation and estimation of discrete time multi-state semi-Markov
  and Markov models. For the semi-Markov case we have considered: parametric and non-parametric
  estimation; with and without censoring at the beginning and/or at the end of sample
  paths; one or several independent sample paths. Several discrete-time distributions
  are considered for the parametric estimation of sojourn time distributions of semi-Markov
  chains: Uniform, Geometric, Poisson, Discrete Weibull and Binomial Negative.'
