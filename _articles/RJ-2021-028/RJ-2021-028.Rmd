title: 'JMcmprsk: An R Package for Joint Modelling of Longitudinal and Survival Data
  with Competing Risks'
abstract: In this paper, we describe an R package named **JMcmprsk**, for joint modelling
  of longitudinal and survival data with competing risks. The package in its current
  version implements two joint models of longitudinal and survival data proposed to
  handle competing risks survival data together with continuous and ordinal longitudinal
  outcomes respectively [@elashoff2008joint; @li2010joint]. The corresponding R implementations
  are further illustrated with real examples. The package also provides simulation
  functions to simulate datasets for joint modelling with continuous or ordinal outcomes
  under the competing risks scenario, which provide useful tools to validate and evaluate
  new joint modelling methods.
