  with Competing Risks'
abstract: In this paper, we describe an R package named **JMcmprsk**, for joint modelling
  of longitudinal and survival data with competing risks. The package in its current
  version implements two joint models of longitudinal and survival data proposed to
  handle competing risks survival data together with continuous and ordinal longitudinal
  outcomes respectively [@elashoff2008joint; @li2010joint]. The corresponding R implementations
  are further illustrated with real examples. The package also provides simulation
  functions to simulate datasets for joint modelling with continuous or ordinal outcomes
  under the competing risks scenario, which provide useful tools to validate and evaluate
  new joint modelling methods.

# Introduction

Joint modeling of longitudinal and survival data has drawn a lot of
attention over the past two decades. Much of the research has been
focused on data with a single event time and a single type of failure,
usually under the assumption of independent censoring of event times
[@tsiatis2004joint]. However, in some situations interest lies with
competing risks data, where there is more than one possible cause of an
event or where the censoring is informative [@williamson2008joint].
Typically, a standard linear mixed model or its extensions are used for
the longitudinal submodel. Cause-specific hazards model with either
unspecified or spline baseline hazards are studied for the competing
risk submodels. Various types of random effects are assumed to account
for the association between these submodels.

Despite various theoretical and methodological developments
[@hickey2018joint; @papageorgiou2019overview], there are still limited
software packages to deal with specific problems in the analysis of
follow-up data in clinical studies. To our knowledge, currently, there
are three related CRAN R packages, namely **JM** [@rizopoulos2012joint],
**joineR** [@williamson2008joint], and **lcmm** [@proust2017estimation],
which support the modeling of longitudinal and survival data with
competing risks.

The **JM** package provides support for competing risks via the
\"CompRisk\" option in the `jointModel()` function. In **JM**, a linear
mixed-effects submodel is modeled for the longitudinal part and a
relative risk submodel is assumed for each competing event. In the
current version (1.4-8), only the piecewise proportional hazards model,
where the log baseline hazard is approximated using B-splines, is
supported for the survival component. The **joineR** package fits the
joint model [@williamson2008joint] for joint models of longitudinal data
and competing risks using the `joint()` function. In their model, the
time-to-event data is modeled using a cause-specific Cox proportional
hazards regression model with time-varying covariates. The longitudinal
outcome is modeled using a linear mixed effects model. The association
is captured by a zero-mean shared latent Gaussian process. Parameters in
the model are estimated using an Expectation Maximization(EM) algorithm.
The **lcmm** package implements the support for competing risks joint
modeling in the `Jointlcmm()` function. Radically different from the
above two R packages, the **lcmm** package uses a less well-known
framework called the joint latent class model [@proust2014joint], which
assumes that dependency between the longitudinal markers and the
survival risk can be captured by a latent class structure entirely.
However, the **lcmm** package is mainly designed for prediction purpose
and may not be suited to evaluate specific assumptions regarding the
characteristics of the marker trajectory that are the most influential
on the event risk [@proust2014joint].

In all these packages, a time-independent shared random effects vector
is usually assumed in modeling the longitudinal and survival data.
However, they are not capable of fitting more flexible models with
separate random effects in these submodels
[@elashoff2008joint; @li2010joint]. In many biomedical applications,
sometimes, it is necessary to have a model which takes into account
longitudinal ordinal outcomes for the longitudinal part. Yet, due to the
complex nature of joint modeling, most of the available software does
not support longitudinal ordinal variables
[@armero2016bayesian; @Ferrer2017phd]. We thus decided to fill this gap
and implemented a joint model which supports ordinal disease markers
based on our previous work [@li2010joint].

Both **JM** and **joineR** packages depend heavily on the R **nlme** and
**survival** packages. In **JM**, the linear mixed-effects submodel and
the survival submodel are first fitted using` lme()` and `coxph()` R
function in these packages before a joint modeling process. In
**joineR**, `lme()` and `coxph()` functions are applied to obtain
initial values for parameters in the joint model, which are further
estimated by an EM algorithm. The major advantage of using available
packages such as **survival** and **nlme** lies that joint modeling R
packages can be built quickly with adequate efficiency as most of these
base R packages have been optimized for speed. However, if required
functionality is not available in these packages, as is the case of
[@elashoff2008joint] and [@li2010joint], implementing new joint modeling
methods is a non-trivial task.

Compared with **JM** and **joineR** packages, the **JMcmprsk** package
introduced here can be regarded as a \"stand-alone\" R package, which
does not required initial estimates for the linear mixed effects model
or survival submodel to compute parameters of the joint model in
question. In particular, the **JMcmprsk** package is built within the
**Rcpp** [@eddelbuettel2011rcpp] and **GSL**(The GNU Scientific
Library)[@galassi2002gnu] framework, which make R functions have access
to a wide range of fast numerical routines such as Monte Carlo
integration, numerical integration and differentiation.

#  Joint Models with Competing Risks 

A joint model for competing risk data consists of two linked components:
the longitudinal submodel, which takes care of repeatedly measured
information and the survival submodel, which deals with multiple failure
times. The combination of different longitudinal and survival components
leads to a variety of joint models [@hickey2018comparison].

In the current version of **JMcmprsk**, we have implemented two joint
models for competing risk data, namely joint modeling with continuous
longitudinal outcomes [@elashoff2008joint], and joint modeling with
ordinal longitudinal outcomes [@li2010joint]. Both models have adopted a
cause-specific Cox submodel with a frailty term for multiple survival
endpoints. The difference between these two models lies in the
longitudinal part. The former model applies a linear mixed submodel for
the continuous longitudinal outcome, while the latter model includes a
partial proportional odds submodel for the ordinal longitudinal outcome.

Different from previous approaches
[@rizopoulos2012joint; @williamson2008joint], we assume a flexible
separate random effects structure for the longitudinal submodel and the
survival submodel. Furthermore, the association between both submodels
is modeled by the assumption that the random effects in two submodels
jointly have a multivariate normal distribution.

## Model 1: Joint modeling with continuous longitudinal outcomes

Let $Y_i(t)$ be the longitudinal outcome measured at time $t$ for
subject $i$, $i=1,2,\cdots,n$ and $n$ is the total number of subjects in
study. Let $C_i=(T_i,D_i)$ denote the competing risks data on subject
$i$, where $T_i$ is the failure time or censoring time, and $D_i$ takes
value in $\{0,1,\cdots,g\}$, with $D_i=0$ indicating a censored event
and $D_i=k$ showing that subject $i$ fails from the $k$th type of
failure, where $k=1,\cdots,g$.

The joint model is specified in terms of the following two linked
submodels:
$$\begin{aligned}
Y_i(t)&=&X_i^{(1)}(t)^\top \beta+\tilde X_i^{(1)}(t)^\top b_i+\epsilon_i(t),\\
\lambda_k(t)&=&\lambda_{0k}(t)\exp(X_i^{(2)}(t)^\top \gamma_k+\nu_k u_i),~~for~~k=1,\cdots,g,
\end{aligned}$$
where $X_i^{(1)}(t)$, $X_i^{(2)}(t)$ denote the covariates for the
fixed-effects $\beta$ and $\gamma_k$, $\tilde X_i^{(1)}(t)$ denotes the
covariates for the random-effects $b_i$ and
$\epsilon_i(t)\sim N(0,\sigma^2)$ for all $t\geq 0$. The parameter
$\nu_1$ is set to 1 to ensure identifiability. We assume that $b_i$ is
independent of $\epsilon_i(t)$ and that $\epsilon_i(t_1)$ is independent
of $\epsilon_i(t_2)$ for any $t_1\neq t_2$. We further assume the random
effects $b_i$ and $u_i$ jointly have a multivariate normal distribution,
denoted by $\theta_i\sim N(0,\Sigma)$, where
$\Sigma=(\Sigma_{b},\Sigma_{bu}^\top;\Sigma_{bu},\sigma_u)$.

Denote $\Psi$ as the unknown parameters from the joint models. We
propose to obtain the maximum likelihood estimate of $\Psi$ through an
EM algorithm. The complete data likelihood is
$$\begin{aligned}
&&L(\Psi;Y,C,\theta)\\
&&\propto \Pi_{i=1}^n\Big[\Pi_{j=1}^{n_i}\frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi\sigma^2}}\exp(-\frac{1}{2\sigma^2}(Y_{ij}-X_i^{(1)}(t_{ij})^\top\beta-\tilde X_i^{(1)}(t_{ij})^\top b_i)^2)\Big]\\
&&\times \Pi_{k=1}^g\lambda_k(T_i)^{I(D_i=k)}\exp\Big\{-\int_0^{T_i}\sum_{k=1}^g\lambda_k(t)dt\Big\}\\
&&\times \frac{1}{\sqrt{(2\pi)^d|\Sigma|}}\exp(-\frac{1}{2}\theta_i^\top\Sigma^{-1}\theta_i).
\end{aligned}$$

In the E-step, we need to calculate the expected value of all the
functions of $\theta$. Since the integral over the random effects does
not have a closed-form solution, an iterative numerical method has to be
employed.

In **JMcmprsk**, the integral over time is approximated using a
Gauss-Kronrod quadrature and the computation of the integral over the
individual random effects is achieved using a Gauss-Hermite quadrature.
The quadrature approximates the integral using a weighted sum of
function values at specified points within the domain of integration;
the Gaussian quadrature is based on the use of polynomial functions. A
standard option here is the Gaussian quadratic rules. In the M-step,
$\Psi$ is updated by maximizing the functions obtained from the E-step.

## Model 2: Joint modeling with ordinal longitudinal outcomes

Let $Y_{ij}$ denote the $j$th response measured on subject $i$, where
$i=1,\cdots,n$, $j=1,\cdots,n_i$, and $Y_{ij}$ takes values in
$\{1,\cdots,K\}$. The competing risks failure times on subject $i$ is
$(T_i,D_i)$, and the notations have the same meaning as in Model 1.

We propose the following partial proportional odds model for $Y_{ij}$
$$\begin{aligned}
P(Y_{ij}\leq k|X_{ij},\tilde X_{ij},W_{ij},b_i)=\frac{1}{1+\exp(-\theta_{k}-X_{ij}\beta-\tilde X_{ij}\alpha_{k}-W_{ij}^\top b_i)},
\end{aligned}$$
where $k=1,\cdots,K-1$, $X_{ij}$ and $\tilde X_{ij}$ are $p\times 1$ and
$s\times 1$ vectors of covariates for the fixed-effect $\beta$ and
$\alpha_{k}$, with $\alpha_{1}=0$, and $\tilde X_{ij}$ is a subset of
$X_{ij}$ for which the proportional odds assumption may not be
satisfied. The $q\times 1$ vector $b_i$ represents random effects of the
associated covariates $W_{ij}$.

The distribution of the competing risks failure times $(T_i,D_i)$ are
assumed to take the form of the following cause-specific hazards frailty
model:
$$\begin{aligned}
\lambda_d(t|Z_i(t),u_i)&=&\lambda_{0d}(t)\exp(Z_i(t)^\top \gamma_d+\nu_d u_i),~~for~~d=1,\cdots,g,
\end{aligned}$$
where the $l\times 1$ vector $\gamma_d$ and $\nu_d$ are the
cause-specific coefficients for the covariates $Z_i(t)$ and the random
effects $u_i$, respectively.

The parameter $\nu_1$ is set to 1 to ensure identifiability. We assume
the random effects $b_i$ and $u_i$ jointly have a multivariate normal
distribution, denoted by $a_i\sim N(0,\Sigma)$.

Denote $\Psi$ as the unknown parameters from the joint models. We
propose to obtain the maximum likelihood estimate of $\Psi$ through an
EM algorithm. The complete data likelihood is
$$\begin{aligned}
&&L(\Psi;Y,C,a)\\
&&\propto \Pi_{i=1}^n\Big[\Pi_{j=1}^{n_i}\Pi_{k=1}^{K}\{\pi_{ij}(k)-\pi_{ij}(k-1)\}^{I(Y_{ij}=k)}\Big]\\
&&\times \Pi_{d=1}^g\lambda_d(T_i)^{I(D_i=d)}\exp\Big\{-\int_0^{T_i}\sum_{k=1}^d\lambda_d(t)dt\Big\}\\
&&\times \frac{1}{\sqrt{(2\pi)^{q+1}|\Sigma|}}\exp(-\frac{1}{2}a_i^\top\Sigma^{-1}a_i).
\end{aligned}$$
where $\pi_{ij}(k)$ stands for the probability that $Y_{ij}\leq k$ given
the covariates and the random effects. The implementation of EM
algorithm in this case is similar to the procedure of Model 1.

# Package structure and functionality

The R package **JMcmprsk** implements the above two joint models on the
basis of R package **Rcpp** [@eddelbuettel2011rcpp] and **GSL**
library[@galassi2002gnu] and is hosted at CRAN. After setting the GSL
environment by following the instructions in the INSTALL file from the
package, we can issue the following command in the R console to install
the package:

\> install.packages(\"JMcmprsk\")

There are two major functions included in the **JMcmprsk** package: the
function that fits continuous outcomes `jmc()` and the function that
fits ordinal outcomes `jmo()`.

## jmc() function

As an illustrative example of `jmc()`, we consider Scleroderma Lung
Study [@tashkin2006cyclophosphamide], a double-blinded, randomized
clinical trial to evaluate the effectiveness of oral cyclophosphamide
(CYC) versus placebo in the treatment of lung disease due to
scleroderma. This study consists of 158 patients and the primary outcome
is forced vital capacity (FVC, as % predicted) determined at 3-month
intervals from the baseline. The event of interest is the
time-to-treatment failure or death. We consider two covariates, baseline
%FVC ($FVC_0$) and baseline lung fibrosis ($FIB_0$) and two risks,
informative and noninformative. The model setups are as follows:
$$\begin{aligned}
\%FVC_{ij}&=&\beta_0+\beta_1t_{ij}+\beta_2FVC_{0i}+\beta_3FIB_{0i}+\beta_4CYC_i\\
&&+\beta_5FVC_{0i}\times CYC_i+\beta_6FIB_{0i}\times CYC_i+\beta_7 t_{ij}\times CYC_i+b_it_{ij}+\epsilon,
\end{aligned}$$
and the cause-specific hazards frailty models are
$$\begin{aligned}
\lambda_1(t)=\lambda_{01}(t)\exp(\gamma_{11}FVC_{0i}+\gamma_{12}FIB_{0i}+\gamma_{13}CYC_i+\gamma_{14}FVC_{0i}\times CYC_i+\gamma_{15}FIB_{0i}\times CYC_i+u_i)\\
\lambda_2(t)=\lambda_{02}(t)\exp(\gamma_{21}FVC_{0i}+\gamma_{22}FIB_{0i}+\gamma_{23}CYC_i+\gamma_{24}FVC_{0i}\times CYC_i+\gamma_{25}FIB_{0i}\times CYC_i+\nu_2u_i),
\end{aligned}$$

We first load the package and the data.

``` r
library(JMcmprsk)
set.seed(123)
data(lung)
yread <- lung[, c(1,2:11)]
cread <- unique(lung[, c(1, 12, 13, 6:10)])
```

The number of rows in \"yread\" is the total number of measurements for
all subjects in the study. For \"cread\", the survival/censoring time is
included in the first column, and the failure type coded as 0 (censored
events), 1 (risk 1), or 2 (risk 2) is given in the second column. Two
competing risks are assumed.

Then, \"yread\" and \"cread\" are used as the longitudinal and survival
input data for the model specified by the function `jmc() `as shown
below:

``` r
jmcfit <- jmc(long_data = yread, surv_data = cread, out = "FVC",
           FE = c("time", "FVC0", "FIB0", "CYC", "FVC0.CYC",
                  "FIB0.CYC", "time.CYC"),
           RE = "linear", ID = "ID",cate = NULL, intcpt = 0,
           quad.points = 20, quiet = TRUE, do.trace = FALSE)
```

where `out` is the name of the outcome variable in the longitudinal
sub-model, `FE` the list of covariates for the fixed effects in the
longitudinal sub-model, `RE` the types/vector of random effects in the
longitudinal sub-model, `ID` the column name of subject id, `cate` the
list of categorical variables for the fixed effects in the longitudinal
sub-model, `intcpt` the indicator of random intercept coded as 1 (yes,
default) or 0(no). The option `quiet` is used to print the progress of
function, the default is TRUE (no printing).

A concise summary of the results can be obtained using `jmcfit `as shown
below:

``` r
>jmcfit
Call:
 jmc(long_data = yread, surv_data = cread, out = "FVC",
FE = c("time", "FVC0", "FIB0", "CYC", "FVC0.CYC", "FIB0.CYC", "time.CYC"),
RE = "linear", ID = "ID", cate = NULL, intcpt = 0, quad.points = 20, quiet = FALSE)

```

The resulting table contains three parts, the fixed effects in
longitudinal model, survival model and random effects. It gives the
estimated parameters in the first column, the standard error in the
second column, and 95% confidence interval and $p$-value for these
parameters in the third and fourth columns. In our example, there is
only one random effect. If there is more than one random effect, the
output will include
$sigma_b11, sigma_b12, sigma_b22, sigma_b1u, sigma_b2u$, and so on.

The supporting function `coef()` can be used to extract the coefficients
of the longitudinal/survival process by specifying the argument `coeff`,
where\"beta\" and \"gamma\" denotes the longitudinal and survival
submodel fixed effects, respectively.

``` r
beta <- coef(jmcfit, coeff = "beta")

```

The supporting function `summary()` can be used to extract the point
estimate, the standard error, 95%CI, and $p$-values of the coefficients
of both sub-models with the option `coeff` to specify which submodel
fixed effects one would like to extract, and `digits`, the number of
digits to be printed out. We proceed below to extract the fixed effects
for both submodels:

We proceed to test the global hypothesis for the longitudinal and the
survival submodels using `linearTest()`.

``` r
>linearTest(jmcfit, coeff="beta")
             Chisq df Pr(>|Chi|)
L*beta=Cb 1072.307  7 0.0000
>linearTest(jmcfit, coeff="gamma")
              Chisq df Pr(>|Chi|)
L*gamma=Cg 11.06558 10 0.3524
```

The results suggest that the hypothesis
$\beta_1=\beta_2=\cdots=\beta_7=0$ is rejected, and the hypothesis
$\gamma_{11}=\gamma_{12}=\cdots=
\gamma_{15} = \gamma_{21}=\gamma_{22}=\cdots=\gamma_{25}=0$ is not
rejected at the significance level of 0.05.

`linearTest()` can also be used to test any linear hypothesis about the
coefficients for each submodel. For example, if one wants to test
$H_0 : \beta_1 = \beta_2$ in the longitudinal submodel, then we start
with a linear contrast `Lb` and pass it to `linearTest()`.

``` r
Lb <- matrix(c(1, -1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0), ncol = length(beta)-1, nrow = 1)
>linearTest(jmcfit, coeff="beta", Lb = Lb)
             Chisq df Pr(>|Chi|)
L*beta=Cb 124.8179  1 0.0000
```

Note that we do not include intercept for linear hypotheses testing. It
is seen that the hypothesis $\beta_1 = \beta_2$ is rejected at level
0.05 in the above example.

Similarly, a linear hypotheses testing can also be done in the survival
submodel using `linearTest()`. For example, if we want to test
$H_0: \gamma_{11} = \gamma_{21}$, then we start with another linear
contrast `Lg` and pass it to `linearTest()`.

``` r
Lg <- matrix(c(1, 0, 0, 0, 0, -1, 0, 0, 0, 0), ncol = length(gamma), nrow = 1)
>linearTest(jmcfit, coeff="gamma", Lg = Lg)
              Chisq df Pr(>|Chi|)
L*gamma=Cg 4.301511  1 0.0381
```

It is seen that the hypothesis $\gamma_{11} = \gamma_{21}$ is rejected
at level 0.05.

For categorical variables, `jmc()` function will create the appropriate
dummy variables automatically as needed within the function. The
reference group in a categorical variable is specified as the one that
comes first alphabetically. Below is another example:

First, we add two categorical variables \"sex\" and \"race\" to the
longitudinal data set \"yread\", in which \"sex\" is coded as \"Female\"
or \"Male\", and race is coded as \"Asian\", \"White\", \"Black\", or
\"Hispanic\".

``` r
#make up two categorical variables and add them into yread
set.seed(123)
sex <- sample(c("Female", "Male"), nrow(cread), replace = TRUE)
race <- sample(c("White", "Black", "Asian", "Hispanic"),
               nrow(cread), replace = TRUE)
ID <- cread$ID
cate_var <- data.frame(ID, sex, race)
if (require(dplyr)) {
  yread <- dplyr::left_join(yread, cate_var, by = "ID")
}
```

Second, we rerun the model with the two added categorical variables.

``` r
# run jmc function again for yread file with two added categorical variables
res2 <- jmc(long_data = yread, surv_data = cread,
            out = "FVC", cate = c("sex", "race"),
            FE = c("time", "FVC0", "FIB0", "CYC", "FVC0.CYC",
                   "FIB0.CYC", "time.CYC"),
            RE = "time", ID = "ID", intcpt = 0,
            quad.points = 20, quiet = FALSE)
res2
```

We can obtain the estimated coefficients of the longitudinal process
using `coef()`.

``` r
> coef(res2, coeff = "beta")
  intercept        time        FVC0        FIB0         CYC    FVC0.CYC    FIB0.CYC    time.CYC

```

## jmo() function

The implementation of `jmo()` is very similar to that of `jmc()`. As an
illustrative example, we use the data from [@national1995tissue]. In
this study, 624 patients are included, and the patients treated with
rt-PA were compared with those given placebo to look for an improvement
from baseline in the score on the modified Rankin scale, an ordinal
measure of the degree of disability with categories ranging from no
symptoms, no significant disability to severe disability or death, which
means in this example, $Y_{ij}$ takes $K=4$ ordinal values. The
following covariates are considered: treatment group (rt-PA or placebo),
modified Rankin scale prior stroke onset, time since randomization
(dummy variables for 3, 6 and 12 months), and the three subtypes of
acute stroke (small vessel occlusive disease, large vessel
atherosclerosis or cardioembolic stroke, and unknown reasons).
Similarly, we also consider the informative and noninformative risks.
The model setups are as follows:
$$\begin{aligned}
P(Y_{ij}\leq k)&=&[1+\exp(-\theta_{k}-(\beta_1Group+\beta_2\text{ Modified Rankin scale prior onset }+\beta_3time3\\
&&+\beta_4time6+\beta_5time12+\beta_6\text{ Small vessel }+\beta_7 \text{ Large vessel or cardioembolic stroke} \\
&&+\beta_8 \text{ Small vessel}*\text{group}+\beta_9\text{ Large vessel or cardioembolic stroke}*\text{group})\\
&&-(\alpha_{k1}\text{ Small vessel}+\alpha_{k2}\text{ Large vessel or cardioembolic stroke})-b_i)]^{-1},
\end{aligned}$$
where $k=1,\cdots,K-1$.
$$\begin{aligned}
\lambda_1(t)&=&\lambda_{01}(t)\exp(\gamma_{11}Group+\gamma_{12}\text{ Modified Rankin scale prior onset}\\
&&+\gamma_{13}\text{ Small vessel}+\gamma_{14}\text{ Large vessel or cardioembolic stroke}\\
&&+\gamma_{15}\text{ Small vessel}*group+\gamma_{16}\text{ Large vessel or cardioembolic stroke} *group+u_i)\\
\lambda_2(t)&=&\lambda_{02}(t)\exp(\gamma_{21}Group+\gamma_{22}\text{ Modified Rankin scale prior onset}\\
&&+\gamma_{23}\text{ Small vessel}+\gamma_{24}\text{ Large vessel or cardioembolic stroke}\\
&&+\gamma_{25}\text{ Small vessel}*group+\gamma_{26}\text{ Large vessel or cardioembolic stroke }*group+\nu_2u_i)
\end{aligned}$$

We first load the package and the data.

``` r
library(JMcmprsk)
set.seed(123)
data(ninds)
yread <- ninds[, c(1, 2:14)]
cread <- ninds[, c(1, 15, 16, 6, 10:14)]
cread <- unique(cread)
```

and the other arrangements are the same with those in `jmc()`,

``` r
jmofit <- jmo(yread, cread, out = "Y",
              FE = c("group", "time3", "time6", "time12", "mrkprior",
                     "smlves", "lvORcs", "smlves.group", "lvORcs.group"),
              cate = NULL,RE = "intercept", NP = c("smlves", "lvORcs"),
              ID = "ID",intcpt = 1, quad.points = 20,
              max.iter = 1000, quiet = FALSE, do.trace = FALSE)
```

where `NP` is the list of non-proportional odds covariates and `FE` the
list of proportional odds covariates.

To see a concise summary of the result, we can type:

``` r
>jmofit
Call:
 jmo(long_data = yread, surv_data = cread, out = "Y",
FE = c("group", "time3", "time6", "time12", "mrkprior", "smlves", "lvORcs", "smlves.group", "lvORcs.group"),
RE = "intercept", NP = c("smlves", "lvORcs"), ID = "ID", cate = NULL, intcpt = 1,
quad.points = 20, max.iter = 1000, quiet = FALSE, do.trace = FALSE)

The usage of function `coef()` is similar to those in Model 1. More
specifically, `coef()` can extract the coefficients of non-proportional
odds fixed effects and logit-specific intercepts. For example,

``` r
alpha <- coef(jmofit, coeff = "alpha")
>alpha
     smlves_NP  lvORcs_NP
[1,] 0.2724605 -0.4528214
[2,] 1.7843743 -0.1363731

theta <- coef(jmofit, coeff = "theta")
> theta
[1] -6.233618 -4.191114  3.980638
```

The usage of function `summary()` is the same as in Model 1. It extracts
the point estimate, standard error, 95%CI, and $p$-values of the
coefficients of both submodels as demonstrated below:

``` r

Analogous to `jmcfit`, `linearTest()` can be used to the global
hypothesis for the longitudinal and the survival submodels.

``` r
> linearTest(jmofit,coeff="beta")
             Chisq df Pr(>|Chi|)
L*beta=Cb 1096.991  9 0.0000
> linearTest(jmofit,coeff="gamma")
              Chisq df Pr(>|Chi|)
L*gamma=Cg 47.15038 12 0.0000
> linearTest(jmofit,coeff="alpha")
              Chisq df Pr(>|Chi|)
L*alpha=Ca 8.776262  4 0.0669
```

According to the $p$-values, the hypothesis
$\beta_1=\beta_2=\cdots=\beta_9=0$ is rejected,
$\gamma_{11}=\gamma_{12}=\cdots=\gamma_{16}= \gamma_{21}=\gamma_{22}=\cdots=\gamma_{26}=0$
is rejected, but $\alpha_{11}=\alpha_{12}= \alpha_{21}=\alpha_{22}=0$ is
not rejected at the significance level of 0.05.

Similarly, `linearTest()` can be used to test a linear hypothesis for
non-proportional odds fixed effects in the longitudinal submodel. For
example, if we want to test $H_0 : \alpha_{11} = \alpha_{21}$, then we
can simply type:

``` r
La <- matrix(c(1, 0, -1, 0), ncol = length(alpha), nrow = 1)
> linearTest(jmofit, coeff = "alpha", La = La)
              Chisq df Pr(>|Chi|)
L*alpha=Ca 1.929563  1 0.1648
```

It is seen that the hypothesis $\alpha_{11} = \alpha_{21}$ is not
rejected at level 0.05.

Likewise, `jmo()` function allows for categorical variables. Moreover,
categorical variables are allowed for setting up non-proportional odds
covariates. As an illustration, here we consider the \"sex\" and
\"race\" variables and use them as two of the non-proportional odds
covariates. Below is another example:

``` r
#Create two categorical variables and add them into yread
ID <- cread$ID
set.seed(123)
sex <- sample(c("Female", "Male"), nrow(cread), replace = TRUE)
race <- sample(c("White", "Black", "Asian", "Hispanic"), nrow(cread), replace = TRUE)
cate_var <- data.frame(ID, sex, race)
if (require(dplyr)) {
   yread <- dplyr::left_join(yread, cate_var, by = "ID")
   }

res2 <- jmo(yread, cread, out = "Y",
            FE = c("group", "time3", "time6", "time12", "mrkprior",
                   	"smlves", "lvORcs", "smlves.group", "lvORcs.group"), cate = c("race", "sex"),
            RE = "intercept", NP = c("smlves", "lvORcs", "race", "sex"), ID = "ID",intcpt = 1,
            quad.points = 20, max.iter = 10000, quiet = FALSE, do.trace = FALSE)

## Older versions of jmc() and jmo()

In the previous versions of **JMcmprsk**, both the previous `jmc()` and
`jmo()` functions require the longitudinal input data \"yfile\" to be in
a specific format regarding the order of the outcome variable and the
random and fixed effects covariates. It also requires users to create an
additional \"mfile\" for the longitudinal data. At the suggestions of
the reviewers, in the most recent version, we focus and develop
user-friendly versions of these functions.

However, for both package consistency and user's convenience, we still
keep older versions of these functions in the package, and rename these
functions to `jmc_0()` and `jmo_0()`, respectively. Supporting functions
of` jmo()` and `jmc()`, such as `coef()`, `summary()`, `linearTest()`,
also apply to `jmc_0()` and `jmo_0()` functions.

Here, we show the usage of `jmc_0()` with some simulated data and the
\"lung\" data used in presenting `jmc()` functions.

If the data are provided as files, the function `jmc_0()` has the
following usage:

``` r
library(JMcmprsk)
yfile=system.file("extdata", "jmcsimy.txt", package = "JMcmprsk")
cfile=system.file("extdata", "jmcsimc.txt", package = "JMcmprsk")
mfile=system.file("extdata", "jmcsimm.txt", package = "JMcmprsk")
jmc_0fit = jmc_0(p=4, yfile, cfile, mfile, point=20, do.trace = FALSE)
```

with `p` the dimension of fixed effects (including the intercept) in
`yfile`, the option `point` is the number of points used to approximate
the integral in the E-step, default is 20, and `do.trace` is used to
control whether the program prints the iteration details. Additionally,
the option `type_file` controls the type of data inputs.

If data frames or matrices are provided as inputs, we set the above
`type_file` option as `type_file = FALSE` in the `jmc_0()` function:

``` r
library(JMcmprsk)
data(lung)
lungY <- lung[, c(2:11)]
lungC <- unique(lung[, c(1, 12, 13, 6:10)])
lungC <- lungC[, -1]
## return a vector file with the number of repeated measurements as lungM
lungM <- data.frame(table(lung$ID))
lungM <- as.data.frame(lungM[, 2])
jmc_0fit2=jmc_0(p=8, lungY, lungC, lungM, point=20, do.trace = FALSE, type_file = FALSE)
```

## Computational Complexity

To understand the computational complexity of both `jmc()` and `jmo()`
models, we carried out a variety of simulations with different sample
size and different proportions of events. However, there was no clear
trend observed between the proportions of events and running times.
Hence, only one event distribution with different sample sizes are given
here for illustration purpose. According to Figures [1](#fig:f1) and
[2](#fig:f2), we can easily see that the run time grows much faster as
sample size increases, which implies that the computational complexity
does not follow a linear order. In this case, it will limit joint models
to handling large and even moderate sample size data. To make the joint
modeling more scalable, it is necessary to carry out a novel algorithm
to reduce its computational complexity to a linear order.

function (from 500 to 5000). Data setup: $p$ = 4, $n_q = 6$, 10.4%

sample size was based on one random sample.](Fig2.png){#fig:f2
width="100%" alt="graphic without alt text"}

## Data Simulation

A simulation can generate datasets with exact ground truth for
evaluation. Hence, the simulation of longitudinal and survival data with
multiple failures associated with random effects is an important measure
to assess the performance of joint modeling approaches dealing with
competing risks. In **JMcmprsk**, simulation tools are based on the data
models proposed in [@elashoff2008joint] and [@li2010joint], which can be
used for testing joint models with continuous and ordinal longitudinal
outcomes, respectively.

The main function for simulation data continuous longitudinal outcomes
and survival data with multiple event outcomes is called `SimDataC()`,
which has the following usage:

``` r
SimDataC(k_val, p1_val, p1a_val, p2_val, g_val, truebeta, truegamma,
  randeffect, yfn, cfn, mfn)
```

We briefly explain some of the important options.` k_val` denotes the
number of subjects in study; `p1_val` and `p1a_val `denote the dimension
of fixed effects and random effects in longitudinal measurements,
respectively; `p2_val` and `g_val` denotes the dimension of fixed
effects and number to competing risks in survival data; `truebeta` and
`truegamma` represent the true values of fixe effects in the
longitudinal and the survival submodels, respectively. `randeffect` sets
the true values for random effects in longitudinal and competing risks
parts, namely in the order of $\sigma$,$\sigma_b$,$\nu_2$, and
$\sigma_u$.

The following example generates the datasets used in simulation study in
[@elashoff2008joint]:

``` r
require(JMcmprsk)
set.seed(123)
yfn="jmcsimy1.txt";
cfn="jmcsimc1.txt";
mfn="jmcsimm1.txt";
k_val=200;p1_val=4;p1a_val=1; p2_val=2;g_val=2;
truebeta=c(10,-1,1.5,0.6);truegamma=c(0.8,-1,0.5,-1); randeffect=c(5,0.5,0.5,0.5);
#writing files
SimDataC(k_val, p1_val, p1a_val, p2_val, g_val,truebeta,
         truegamma, randeffect, yfn,  cfn,  mfn)
```

The output of function `SimDataC()` contains additional censoring rate
information and newly generated files names for further usage.

``` r
$`censoring_rate`
[1] 0.21
$rate1
[1] 0.45
$rate2
[1] 0.34
$yfn
[1] "jmcsimy1.txt"
$cfn
[1] "jmcsimc1.txt"
$mfn
[1] "jmcsimm1.txt"
```

The main function for data simulation with ordinal longitudinal outcomes
and survival data with multiple event outcomes is called `SimDataO()`,
the usage of which is very similar to `SimDataC()`:

``` r
SimDataO(k_val, p1_val, p1a_val, p2_val, g_val, truebeta, truetheta,
  truegamma, randeffect, yfn, cfn, mfn)
```

All options have the same meanings as in `SimDataC()`, while
`SimDataO()` has one more option `truetheta`, which sets the true values
of the non-proportional odds longitudinal coefficients subset.

The following example generates the datasets used in simulation study in
[@li2010joint]:

``` r
require(JMcmprsk)
set.seed(123)
yfn="jmosimy1.txt";
cfn="jmosimc1.txt";
mfn="jmosimm1.txt";
 k_val=500;p1_val=3;p1a_val=1; p2_val=2;g_val=2;
truebeta=c(-1,1.5,0.8);truetheta=c(-0.5,1);truegamma=c(0.8,-1,0.5,-1); randeffect=c(1,0.5,0.5);
#writing files
SimDataO(k_val, p1_val, p1a_val, p2_val, g_val,
      truebeta, truetheta, truegamma, randeffect, yfn,  cfn,  mfn)
```

The output of the above function is

``` r
$`censoring_rate`
[1] 0.218
$rate1
[1] 0.414
$rate2
[1] 0.368

# Conclusions and Future Work

In this paper, we have illustrated the capabilities of package
**JMcmprsk** for fitting joint models of time-to-event data with
competing risks for two types of longitudinal data. We also present
simulation tools to generate joint model datasets under different
settings. Several extensions of **JMcmprsk** package are planned to
further expand on what is currently available. First, as the integral
over the random effects becomes computationally burdensome in the case
of high dimensionality, Laplace approximations or other Gauss-Hermite
quadrature rules would be applied to the E-M step to speed up the
computation procedure. Second, with the increasing need for predictive
tools for personalized medicine, dynamic predictions for the
aforementioned joint models will be added. Third, other new joint models
such as joint analysis for bivariate longitudinal ordinal outcomes will
be included.
