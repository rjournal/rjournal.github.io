title: 'MDplot: Visualise Molecular Dynamics'
abstract: 'The MDplot package provides plotting functions to allow for automated visualisation
  of molecular dynamics simulation output. It is especially useful in cases where
  the plot generation is rather tedious due to complex file formats or when a large
  number of plots are generated. The graphs that are supported range from those which
  are standard, such as RMSD/RMSF (root-mean-square deviation and root-mean-square
  fluctuation, respectively) to less standard, such as thermodynamic integration analysis
  and hydrogen bond monitoring over time. All told, they address many com monly used
  analyses. In this article, we set out the MDplot package’s functions, give examples
  of the function calls, and show the associated plots. Plotting and data parsing
  is separated in all cases, i.e. the respective functions can be used independently.
  Thus, data manipulation and the integration of additional file formats is fairly
  easy. Currently, the loading functions support GROMOS, GROMACS, and AMBER file formats.
  Moreover, we also provide a Bash interface that allows simple embedding of MDplot
  into Bash scripts as the final analysis step. Availability: The package can be obtained
  in the latest major version from CRAN (https://cran.r project.org/package=MDplot)
  or in the most recent version from the project’s GitHub page at https://github.com/MDplot/MDplot,
  where feedback is also most welcome. MDplot is published under the GPL-3 license.'
