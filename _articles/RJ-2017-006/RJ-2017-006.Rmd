title: Implementing a Metapopulation Bass Diffusion Model using the R Package deSolve
abstract: 'Diffusion is a fundamental process in physical, biological, social and
  economic settings. Consumer products often go viral, with sales driven by the word
  of mouth effect, as their adoption spreads through a population. The classic diffusion
  model used for product adoption is the Bass diffusion model, and this divides a
  population into two groups of people: potential adopters who are likely to adopt
  a product, and adopters who have purchased the product, and influence others to
  adopt. The Bass diffusion model is normally captured in an aggregate form, where
  no significant consumer differences are modeled. This paper extends the Bass model
  to capture a spatial perspective, using metapopulation equations from the field
  of infectious disease modeling. The paperâ€™s focus is on simulation of deterministic
  models by solving ordinary differential equations, and does not encompass parameter
  estimation. The metapopulation model in implemented in R using the deSolve package,
  and shows the potential of using the R framework to implement large-scale integral
  equation models, with applications in the field of marketing and consumer behaviour.'
