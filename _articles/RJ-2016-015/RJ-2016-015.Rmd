title: 'SWMPr: An R Package for Retrieving, Organizing, and Analyzing Environmental
  Data for Estuaries'
abstract: The System-Wide Monitoring Program (SWMP) was implemented in 1995 by the
  US National Estuarine Research Reserve System. This program has provided two decades
  of continuous monitoring data at over 140 fixed stations in 28 estuaries. However,
  the increasing quantity of data provided by the monitoring network has complicated
  broad-scale comparisons between systems and, in some cases, prevented simple trend
  analysis of water quality parameters at individual sites. This article describes
  the SWMPr package that provides several functions that facilitate data retrieval,
  organization, and analysis of time series data in the reserve estuaries. Previously
  unavailable functions for estuaries are also provided to estimate rates of ecosystem
  metabolism using the open-water method. The SWMPr package has facilitated a cross-reserve
  comparison of water quality trends and links quantitative information with analysis
  tools that have use for more generic applications to environmental time series.
