title: 'SEEDCCA: An Integrated R-Package for Canonical Correlation Analysis and Partial
  Least Squares'
abstract: Canonical correlation analysis (CCA) has a long history as an explanatory
  statistical method in high-dimensional data analysis and has been successfully applied
  in many scientific fields such as chemometrics, pattern recognition, genomic sequence
  analysis, and so on. The so-called seedCCA is a newly developed R package that implements
  not only the standard and seeded CCA but also partial least squares. The package
  enables us to fit CCA to large-$p$ and small-$n$ data. The paper provides a complete
  guide. Also, the seeded CCA application results are compared with the regularized
  CCA in the existing R package. It is believed that the package, along with the paper,
  will contribute to high-dimensional data analysis in various science field practitioners
  and that the statistical methodologies in multivariate analysis become more fruitful.
