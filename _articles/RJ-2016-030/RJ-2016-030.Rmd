title: 'multipleNCC: Inverse Probability Weighting of Nested Case-Control Data'
abstract: 'Reuse of controls from nested case-control designs can increase efficiency
  in many situations, for instance with competing risks or in other multiple endpoints
  situations. The matching between cases and controls must be broken when controls
  are to be used for other endpoints. A weighted analysis can then be performed to
  take care of the biased sampling from the cohort. We present the R package multipleNCC
  for reuse of controls in nested case-control studies by inverse probability weighting
  of the partial likelihood. The package handles right-censored, left-truncated and
  additionally matched data, and varying numbers of sampled controls and the whole
  analysis is carried out using one simple command. Four weight estimators are presented
  and variance estimation is explained. The package is illustrated by analyzing health
  survey data from three counties in Norway for two causes of death: cardiovascular
  disease and death from alcohol abuse, liver disease, and accidents and violence.
  The data set is included in the package.'
