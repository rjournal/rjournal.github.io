title: 'arulesViz: Interactive Visualization of Association Rules with R'
abstract: Association rule mining is a popular data mining method to discover interesting
  relation ships between variables in large databases. An extensive toolbox is available
  in the R-extension package arules. However, mining association rules often results
  in a vast number of found rules, leaving the analyst with the task to go through
  a large set of rules to identify interesting ones. Sifting manually through extensive
  sets of rules is time-consuming and strenuous. Visualization and espe cially interactive
  visualization has a long history of making large amounts of data better accessible.
  The R-extension package arulesViz provides most popular visualization techniques
  for association rules. In this paper, we discuss recently added interactive visualizations
  to explore association rules and demonstrate how easily they can be used in arulesViz
  via a unified interface. With examples, we help to guide the user in selecting appropriate
  visualizations and interpreting the results.
