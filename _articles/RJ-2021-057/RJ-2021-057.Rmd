title: 'garchx: Flexible and Robust GARCH-X Modeling'
abstract: The garchx package provides a user-friendly, fast, flexible, and robust
  framework for the estimation and inference of GARCH($p,q,r$)-X models, where $p$
  is the ARCH order, $q$ is the GARCH order, $r$ is the asymmetry or leverage order,
  and 'X' indicates that covariates can be included. Quasi Maximum Likelihood (QML)
  methods ensure estimates are consistent and standard errors valid, even when the
  standardized innovations are non-normal or dependent, or both. Zero-coefficient
  restrictions by omission enable parsimonious specifications, and functions to facilitate
  the non-standard inference associated with zero-restrictions in the null-hypothesis
  are provided. Finally, in the formal comparisons of precision and speed, the garchx
  package performs well relative to other prominent GARCH-packages on CRAN.
