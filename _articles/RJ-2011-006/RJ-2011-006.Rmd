title: 'rworldmap : a new R package for mapping global data'
abstract: rworldmap is a new package available on CRAN for mapping and visualisation
  of global data. The vision is to make the display of global data easier, to facilitate
  understanding and com munication. The initial concentration is on data referenced
  by country or grid due to the frequency of use of such data in global assessments.
  Tools to link data referenced by country (either name or code) to a map, and then
  to display the map are provided as are functions to map global gridded data. Country
  and gridded functions accept the same arguments to specify the nature of categories
  and colour and how legends are formatted. This package builds on the functionality
  of existing packages, particularly sp, maptools and fields. Example code is provided
  to produce maps, to link with the packages classInt, RColorBrewer and ncdf, and
  to plot examples of publicly available country and gridded data.
