title: 'Distance Measures for Time Series in R: The TSdist Package'
abstract: The definition of a distance measure between time series is crucial for
  many time series data mining tasks, such as clustering and classification. For this
  reason, a vast portfolio of time series distance measures has been published in
  the past few years. In this paper, the TSdist package is presented, a complete tool
  which provides a unified framework to calculate the largest variety of time series
  dissimilarity measures available in R at the moment, to the best of our knowledge.
  The package implements some popular distance measures which were not previously
  available in R, and moreover, it also provides wrappers for measures already included
  in other R packages. Additionally, the application of these distance measures to
  clustering and classification tasks is also supported in TSdist, directly enabling
  the evaluation and comparison of their performance within these two frameworks.
