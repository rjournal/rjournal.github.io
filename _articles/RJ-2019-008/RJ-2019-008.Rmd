title: Optimization Routines for Enforcing One-to-One Matches in Record Linkage Problems
abstract: Record linkage aims at quickly and accurately identifying if two records
  represent the same real world entity. In many applications, we are interested in
  restricting the linkage results to "1 to 1" links, that is a single record does
  not appear more than once in the output. This can be dealt with the transport algorithm.
  The optimization problem, however, grows quadratically in the size of the input,
  quickly becoming untreatable for cases with a few thousand records. This paper compares
  different solutions, provided by some R packages for linear programming solvers.
  The comparison is done in terms of memory usage and execution time. The aim is to
  overcome the current implementation in the toolkit RELAIS, specifically developed
  for record linkage problems. The results highlight improvements beyond expectations.
  In fact the tested solutions allow successfully executing the "1 to 1" reduction
  for large size datasets up to the largest sample surveys at National Statistical
  Institutes.
