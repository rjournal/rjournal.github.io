title: 'netgwas: An R Package for Network-Based Genome Wide Association Studies'
abstract: Graphical models are a powerful tool in modelling and analysing complex
  biological associations in high-dimensional data. The R-package netgwas implements
  the recent methodological development on copula graphical models to (i) construct
  linkage maps, (ii) infer linkage disequilibrium networks from genotype data, and
  (iii) detect high-dimensional genotype-phenotype networks. The netgwas learns the
  structure of networks from ordinal data and mixed ordinal-and-continuous data. Here,
  we apply the functionality in netgwas to various multivariate example datasets taken
  from the literature to demonstrate the kind of insight that can be obtained from
  the package. We show that our package offers a more realistic association analysis
  than the classical approaches, as it discriminates between direct and induced correlations
  by adjusting for the effect of all other variables while performing pairwise associations.
  This feature controls for spurious interactions between variables that can arise
  from conventional approaches in a biological sense. The netgwas package uses a parallelization
  strategy on multi-core processors to speed-up computations.
