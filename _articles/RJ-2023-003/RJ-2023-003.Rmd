title: Making Provenance Work for You
abstract: ' To be useful, scientific results must be reproducible and trustworthy.
  Data provenance---the history of data and how it was computed---underlies reproducibility
  of, and trust in, data analyses. Our work focuses on collecting data provenance
  from R scripts and providing tools that use the provenance to increase the reproducibility
  of and trust in analyses done in R. Specifically, our "End-to-end provenance tools"
  ("E2ETools") use data provenance to: document the computing environment and inputs
  and outputs of a script''s execution; support script debugging and exploration;
  and explain differences in behavior across repeated executions of the same script.
  Use of these tools can help both the original author and later users of a script
  reproduce and trust its results. '
