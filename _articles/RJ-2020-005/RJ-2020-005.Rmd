title: 'lspartition: Partitioning-Based Least Squares Regression'
abstract: Nonparametric partitioning-based least squares regression is an important
  tool in empirical work. Common examples include regressions based on splines, wavelets,
  and piecewise polynomials. This article discusses the main methodological and numerical
  features of the R software package lspartition, which implements results for partitioning-based
  least squares (series) regression estimation and inference from Cattaneo and Farrell
  (2013) and Cattaneo, Farrell, and Feng (2020). These results cover the multivariate
  regression function as well as its derivatives. First, the package provides data-driven
  methods to choose the number of partition knots optimally, according to integrated
  mean squared error, yielding optimal point estimation. Second, robust bias correction
  is implemented to combine this point estimator with valid inference. Third, the
  package provides estimates and inference for the unknown function both pointwise
  and uniformly in the conditioning variables. In particular, valid confidence bands
  are provided. Finally, an extension to two-sample analysis is developed, which can
  be used in treatment-control comparisons and related problems.
