title: 'logitFD: an R package for functional principal component logit regression'
abstract: ' The functional logit regression model was proposed by [@Escabias04] with
  the objective of modeling a scalar binary response variable from a functional predictor.
  The model estimation proposed in that case was performed in a subspace of $L^2(T)$
  of squared integrable functions of finite dimension, generated by a finite set of
  basis functions. For that estimation it was assumed that the curves of the functional
  predictor and the functional parameter of the model belong to the same finite subspace.
  The estimation so obtained was affected by high multicollinearity problems and the
  solution given to these problems was based on different functional principal component
  analysis. The [logitFD](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=logitFD) package introduced
  here provides a toolbox for the fit of these models by implementing the different
  proposed solutions and by generalizing the model proposed in 2004 to the case of
  several functional and non-functional predictors. The performance of the functions
  is illustrated by using data sets of functional data included in the [fda.usc](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=fda.usc)
  package from R-CRAN. '
