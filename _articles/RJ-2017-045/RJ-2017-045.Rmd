title: 'afmToolkit: an R Package for Automated AFM Force-Distance Curves Analysis'
abstract: Atomic force microscopy (AFM) is widely used to measure molecular and colloidal
  inter actions as well as mechanical properties of biomaterials. In this paper the
  afmToolkit R package is introduced. This package allows the user to automatically
  batch process AFM force-distance and force-time curves. afmToolkit capabilities
  range from importing ASCII files and preprocessing the curves (contact point detection,
  baseline correction. . . ) for finding relevant physical information, such as Young’s
  modulus, adhesion energies and exponential decay for force relaxation and creep
  experiments. This package also contains plotting, summary and feature extraction
  functions. The package also comes with several data sets so the user can test the
  aforementioned features with ease. The package afmToolkit eases the basic processing
  of large amount of AFM F-d/t curves at once. It is also flexible enough to easily
  incorporate new functions as they are needed and can be seen as a programming infrastructure
  for further algorithm development.
