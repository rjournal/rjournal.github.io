  through the computation of summary statistics and exploratory data analysis. Unfortunately,
  this step tends to be under-emphasized in the research process, in part because
  of the often tedious nature of thorough exploratory data analysis. The `table1()`
  function in the *furniture* package streamlines much of the exploratory data analysis
  process, making the computation and communication of summary statistics simple and
  beautiful while offering significant time-savings to the researcher.

# Introduction

A major, but often overlooked, aspect of the research process is the
computation of summary statistics and exploratory data analysis. Through
exploratory data analysis, researchers can begin to understand patterns
and relationships in their data that are relevant for more complex
modeling schemes. In addition, this exploration can inform future
directions in their research area and can inspire better research
questions. This is a valuable benefit of assessing summary statistics
and exploring the data, for, as John @tukey1980 stated, \"Finding the
question is often more important than finding the answer.\"

Generally, an important aspect of data exploration is the assessment of
summary statistics. Yet, the computation and reporting of summary
statistics can be tedious and messy, with many researchers computing and
entering values into tables one variable at a time. This can be quite
time-consuming and leaves the researcher susceptible to data-entry
errors. Additionally, in the event of changes to the number of
observations in the sample or to the nature of the stratifying variable,
the whole table must be manually updated. These issues may lead
researchers to conduct only minimal exploratory data analysis,
potentially missing important relationships among study variables.
Researchers may also opt to delegate the computation of summary
statistics to research assistants. This is not always ideal, as
assistants may lack the substantive expertise required to recognize
important or theoretically interesting patterns in the data.

The presentation of sample summary statistics in conjunction with
higher-level data analysis is also essential to the production of
reproducible research.[^1] In many fields there is a struggle to produce
reproducible research
[@OpenScienceCollaboration2015; @Chang2015; @Begley2015]. Thorough
reporting of sample characteristics, including the distribution of
sample characteristics stratified by key study variables, allows other
researchers the opportunity to more carefully evaluate findings,
replicate results, discover further research avenues, and critically
compare findings across multiple studies. In the
[*furniture*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=furniture) package, as
will be demonstrated, obtaining descriptive statistics for all study
variables, either with or without a stratifying variable, is simple and
can be done using just a few lines of code.

It is worth noting that there are other well-designed packages that help
produce descriptive statistics. The package *tableone* is thoroughly
developed and performs similar analyses to `table1()`. However, the
syntax is more complex and lacks some of the flexibility that `table1()`
offers. The *stargazer* and *psych* packages also offer informative
summaries of the data for each variable, but are limited in their use
for publication without manual entry, and offer few options for more
involved data manipulation.

# Data for example analyses

In order to demonstrate the utility of `table1()`, we descriptively
explored and analyzed data from the National Health and Nutrition
Examination Survey (NHANES) provided by the Centers for Disease Control
and Prevention [@nhanes]. The data are attached in the package as
\"nhanes_2010\" after having been cleaned using the *furniture*,
*tidyverse* and *foreign* R packages [@furniture; @tidyverse; @foreign].
The data contain information on general health, activity level, age,
gender, drug use, and chronic conditions for 1,417 young adults (51.4%
female) aged 18-30 (M = 23.3, SD = 3.96). Under the direction of the
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the data were collected via
a complex sampling strategy across the United States in 2013 and 2014.

# Table 1

The general form of `table1()`[^2] is below, with several of the most
common arguments. Note that the structure is similar to other \"tidy\"
packages, with the `data.frame` as the first argument, unquoted
variables, and the ability to pipe.

``` r
  library(furniture)
  table1(df, 
         var1, var2, var3, etc.,
         splitby = ~stratifying_variable,
         test = TRUE,
         type = "pvalues",
         second = NULL,
         output = "text",
         FUN = NULL,
         FUN2 = NULL)
```

where

-   `df` is the `data.frame` or a `tbl_df` from the tidyverse of
    functions,

-   `var1`, etc. are unquoted variable names (any number of variables),

-   `splitby` is a one-sided formula with a variable name,

-   `test` is logical (i.e. `TRUE` or `FALSE`) indicating whether
    bivariate tests of association should be run,

-   `type` allows the p-values and/or test statistics to be displayed,
    along with allowing a simplification of the output of the table,

-   `second` is an optional vector of quoted variable names that,
    instead of means and SDs, are summarized by medians and the
    inter-quartile range (or other user-defined statistics),

-   `output` allows several outputs for the table, including Latex and
    Markdown,

-   `FUN` provides the user with the ability to apply user-defined
    functions to summarize numeric variables (any function that works
    with `tapply()`), and

-   `FUN2`, similarly to `FUN`, allows the user to define a function to
    apply to all variables listed in the `second` argument above.

Notably, if no variables are listed, all variables in the `data.frame`
will be summarized. Other options exist that can be used to better
format and adjust the table, some of which we highlight in subsequent
sections (e.g. `format_number` and `var_names`). However, in its
simplest form, `table1()` only requires the data frame.

``` r
  table1(df)
```

Yet, the function is designed for much more.

The function is built on fast base functions and is appropriate for even
very large data sets ($n > 1,000,000$). It uses simple non-standard
evaluation which allows the user to create and modify variables from
within the function itself. For example, we could summarize levels of a
dichotomous version of `var1` as seen below:

``` r
  table1(df, 
         ifelse(var1 > median(var1), 1, 0),
         splitby = ~stratifying_variable,
         test = TRUE)
```

Other simple modifications are also possible (e.g., `factor(var1)`,
`var1*100`).

## Exploratory data analysis with Table 1

The `table1()` function below is used on the NHANES data to explore
differences in demographic and psychosocial factors between individuals
who have and have not been informed by a doctor that he or she is
overweight. The following code uses the `data.frame` named `d1`, selects
12 variables, stratifies by whether the individual was designated by a
doctor as overweight (`splitby = ~overweight`), calls for tests of
bivariate associations (`test = TRUE`), and is printed in the \"text2\"
format (`output = "text2"`).

``` r
  table1(d1, 
         gender, age, active, marijuana, illicit,
         down, sleeping, low_energy, appetite, feel_bad,
         dead, difficulty,
         splitby = ~overweight,
         test = TRUE,
         output = "text2")
```

The preceding code produces the following table. Note that, for space,
several rows were excluded at the bottom of the table.

``` r
  |======================================================|
                              overweight
                   Yes            No              P-Value
   -               ---            --              -------
   Observations    335            1082                   
   gender                                         0.004  
      Male         139 (41.5%)    549 (50.7%)            
      Female       196 (58.5%)    533 (49.3%)            
   age                                            0.100    
                   23.65 (3.99)   23.24 (3.95)           
   active                                         0.251  
                   151.36 (94.21) 166.83 (106.12)        
   marijuana                                      0.333  
      Yes          181 (59.9%)    535 (56.6%)            
      No           121 (40.1%)    411 (43.4%)            
   ...             ...            ...             ...
  |======================================================|
```

The table provides the $n$ for each group, the means and standard
deviations (SD) by group for each numeric variable, and the counts and
percentages by group for each factor variable. The table can also
provide bivariate statistical comparisons using the supplied stratifying
variable as the independent variable. For categorical variables, a
$\chi^2$ test is performed. For numeric variables, either a t-test or an
analysis of variance is performed (potentially adjusting for
heterogeneity of variance), depending on the number of levels of the
stratifying variable. Only the tests' p-values are shown by default. The
user may also request the specific test statistics (`type = "full"`) or
simply stars representing significance (`type = "stars"`).

If means and SDs are insufficient for a numeric variable, for example in
the case of a highly skewed numeric variable, medians and the
interquartile range (IQR) can be produced through the use of the
\"second\" argument. This argument accepts quoted names of numeric
variables, and for those variables, returns median and IQR in place of
means and SDs by default.

``` r
  table1(d1, 
         gender, age, active, marijuana,
         splitby = ~overweight,
         test = TRUE,
         output = "text2",
         second = c("age", "active"))
```

``` r
  |====================================================|
                             overweight
                   Yes           No             P-Value
   -               ---           --             -------
   Observations    335           1082

      Female       196 (58.5%)   533 (49.3%)

   active                                       0.251  
                   120.00 [90.0] 135.00 [142.5]        
   marijuana                                    0.333  
      Yes          181 (59.9%)   535 (56.6%)           
      No           121 (40.1%)   411 (43.4%)           
  |====================================================|
```

The medians and IQRs are differentiated from the means and SDs by the
square brackets that are applied to the IQRs. This keeps the table clean
but provides information on the types of statistics being presented.

Beneficially, the user can define a function to use in place of the
default means/SDs and medians/IQRs. for numeric variables. This is
through the use of the `FUN` and `FUN2` arguments. `FUN` applies to any
variable not listed in the `second` argument. It can be as simple as
`FUN = min`---asking for the minimum of each variable--or as complicated
of a function as tapply will accept. For an example of a multi-statistic
function, see below.

``` r
  table1(d1, 
         gender, age, active,
         splitby = ~overweight,
         test = TRUE,
         output = "text2",
         FUN = function(x) paste0(min(x, na.rm=TRUE), ", ", max(x, na.rm=TRUE)))
```

The preceding code allows the anonymous function
\[i.e. `function(x) paste0(min(x, ...))`\], to produce the minimum and
maximum, be applied to each of the numeric variables (i.e. in this case,
age and active). This code produces the following table.

``` r
  |===============================================|
                             overweight 
                   Yes         No          P-Value
   -               ---         --          -------
   Observations    335         1082               
   gender                                  0.004  
      Male         139 (41.5%) 549 (50.7%)        
      Female       196 (58.5%) 533 (49.3%)        
   age                                     0.1    
                   18, 30      18, 30             
   active                                  0.251  
                   30, 505     20, 840            
 |===============================================|
```

In the same way, `FUN2` allows the user to specify another function to
be applied to the indicated numeric variables within the same table. It
also allows for simple formatting changes to these statistics as well
(e.g. can insert brackets, commas, or change the rounding of the
numbers). In essence, this makes `table1()` useful for a wide variety of
situations.

We can also simplify and condense the table. As demonstrated below,
`type = "simple"` produces only percentages for the categorical
variables (instead of counts and percentages) and `type = "condense"`
displays the summary only for the reference category of dichotomous
variables and removes much of the white space. Together, they provide a
much more succinct table.

``` r
  table1(d1, 
         gender, age, active, marijuana, illicit, down, 
         splitby = ~overweight,
         test = TRUE,
         output = "text2",
         type = c("simple", "condense"))
```

``` r
  |======================================================|
                              overweight
                   Yes            No              P-Value
   -               ---            --              -------
   Observations    335            1082                   
   gender: Female  58.5%          49.3%           0.004  
   age             23.65 (3.99)   23.24 (3.95)    0.1    
   active          151.36 (94.21) 166.83 (106.12) 0.251  
   marijuana: No   40.1%          43.4%           0.333  
   illicit: No     89.7%          88.4%           0.584  
   down                                           <.001  
      No           69.7%          81.1%                  
      Several Days 21.4%          14.8%                  
      Majority     5.6%           2.8%                   
      Everyday     3.3%           1.3%                   
  |======================================================|
```

Finally, with the rise of \"piping\" [@tidyverse], we have integrated
functionality that allows the table to be part of a bigger pipeline.
When in a pipeline, the function auto-detects the pipe, prints the table
and invisibly returns the original data so that it can continue to be
used in subsequent functions. For example,

``` r
d1 %>%
  filter(age > 20) %>%
  table1(gender, age, active, marijuana, illicit, down, 
         splitby = ~overweight,
         test = TRUE,
         output = "text2",
         type = c("simple", "condense")) %>%
  lm(overweight ~ age + gender, data = .)
```

In the end, these simple tables provide several pieces of important
information. Without needing any advanced modeling, we already have an
idea of several relationships among the study variables. For example,
several demographic and psychosocial factors are related to the
designation by a doctor as being overweight, including trouble sleeping
and feeling down. These insights can inform model building and follow-up
visualizations. `table1()`, in conjunction with other summary techniques
(e.g. the base function `summary` in R), provides a quick and broad
understanding of the patterns and relationships in the data.

## Easy communication of descriptive statistics

In addition to the power of exploratory data analysis in informing
statistical modeling, `table1()` is an important tool in scientific
communication. For this reason, it was equipped with several output
formatting features.[^3] Five that are particularly useful are discussed
below.

1.  `output` allows for two regular console outputs (i.e., \"text\" and
    \"text2\") and all `knitr::kable` options, including \"latex\",
    \"markdown\" and \"html.\"

2.  `var_names` allows the user to provide a list of names that will
    replace the variable names in the table.

3.  `format_number` provides formatting of numbers with commas (e.g.,
    22,000 instead of 22000) when set to `TRUE`.

4.  `type`, in addition to the \"simple\" and \"condense\" options
    discussed previously, provides three options for the presentation of
    statistical tests: 1) \"pvalues\", which is default, and displays
    the p-values for the tests of association, 2) \"stars\" which
    provides the common star notation for p-values, and 3) \"full\"
    which provides the test statistics and the p-values.[^4]

These, among other options, allow for the production of quality tables
that can be easily published via various mediums including peer-reviewed
journals and online webpages.

The example below illustrates the simplicity of communicating the basic
statistics of the NHANES sample in Table 1.

``` r
  table1(d1, 
         gender, age, active, marijuana, illicit,
         down, sleeping, dead, 
         splitby = ~overweight,
         var_names = c("Gender", "Age", "Activity (minutes)", "Marijuana",
                       "Other Illicit Drug", "Feeling Down",
                       "Trouble Sleeping", "Wish Were Dead"),
         format_number = TRUE,
         type = "simple",
         test = TRUE,
         output = "latex")
```

  : Table 1: Latex table produced from `table1()` with a number of
  formatting options.
:::

With only a few lines of code, simple yet important information about
the sample, study variables, and their bivariate relationships to a key
variable are elegantly produced for easy dissemination. With minor
touching up, this table can be ready for professional and peer-reviewed
publications.[^5]

For those using processors other than latex or markdown, the table can
exported to a spreadsheet program, such as Microsoft's Excel, via the
`export` argument. Here, all that needs to be provided is a string that
will be the outputted file name (e.g., \"myfile\"). This will export the
table as a formatted CSV to a new folder in the working directory called
\"Table1.\" From there, the table can be imported into a word processor,
such as Microsoft's Word. Another, more manual option is simply
copying-and-pasting from the console output into a spreadsheet. Using
the \"text to columns\" feature common in spreadsheet programs, this
table can become ready to import into a word processor. Regardless of
the approach, the common errors of manually inputting values into a
table are greatly reduced.

# Additional features

In addition to `table1()`, the *furniture* package contains a data
cleaning function (i.e. `washer()`) and an operator (i.e. `%xt%`).
`washer()` is used to replace values in a vector with other values in a
way that avoids more complex `ifelse` statements. The `%xt%` operator
can be used for simple cross-tabulations among two categorical
variables. These, although not discussed much here, are helpful in
getting the data ready for more in depth analysis in `table1()`. In
fact, both were used to get the data in the format found in the package.
More information can be found in the package documentation and at
[tysonstanley.github.io](tysonstanley.github.io){.uri}.

# Summary

Ultimately, each function in the *furniture* package is designed to
simplify important data exploration with the long-term goal of
increasing both methods and results reproducibility. With the `table1()`
function, the computation and communication of descriptive statistics is
made simple and beautiful, streamlining the exploratory data analysis
process. We hope that the user-friendly syntax and polished output
enables researchers to efficiently perform more thorough exploration of
their data and to more easily communicate their findings.

[^1]: We use the definitions from @Goodman2016: \"methods
    reproducibility\" refers to the ability to obtain the same results
    with the same methods and data and \"results reproducibility\" means
    being able to obtain similar results using the same methods with
    independent data.

[^2]: The analyses for this paper used *furniture* 1.5.4 and R version
    3.4.1.

[^4]: Only the \"pvalues\" option works when `"simple"` or `"condense"`
    are also included.

[^5]: The splitby variable name at the top of Table
    1---\"Overweight\"---was added afterwards. This information does not
    print automatically in the `kable` output.
