title: Furniture for Quantitative Scientists
abstract: A basic understanding of the distributions of study variables and the relationships
  among them is essential to inform statistical modeling. This understanding is achieved
  through the com putation of summary statistics and exploratory data analysis. Unfortunately,
  this step tends to be under-emphasized in the research process, in part because
  of the often tedious nature of thorough exploratory data analysis. The table1()
  function in the furniture package streamlines much of the exploratory data analysis
  process, making the computation and communication of summary statistics simple and
  beautiful while offering significant time-savings to the researcher.
