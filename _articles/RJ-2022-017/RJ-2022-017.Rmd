abstract: ' This paper is an introduction to the new package in R called [smoots](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=smoots)

# Introduction {#sec:intro}

This paper provides an introduction to a new package in R called smoots
[version 1.0.1, @feng2019smoots] for data-driven local polynomial
smoothing of trend-stationary time series. This package is developed
based on the R codes for the practical implementation of the proposals
in @fenggriesfritz2020. Detailed discussion on the methodology and the
development of the algorithms may be found in that work. Here, the main
algorithm is a fully data-driven IPI [iterative plug-in,
@gasser1991flexible] approach for estimating the trend under stationary
time series errors, where the variance factor in the asymptotically
optimal bandwidth is estimated by another IPI-approach for a lag-window
estimator of the spectral density following @buhlmann1996locally.
Numerous sub-algorithms determined by different options, such as the
choice of the order of local polynomial, the choice of the kernel
weighting functions and the choice of the so-called inflation factors
for estimating the bias in the asymptotically optimal bandwidth, are
included. Further functions for data-driven estimation of the first and
second derivatives of the trend are also developed by adapting the idea
of @feng2007asymptotic. A related proposal may be found in
@francisco2004plug. The algorithms included in the smoots package differ
to their proposal in several ways. (1) The IPI-algorithm is usually
superior to the DPI [see @beran2009modifying for detailed discussion in
models with i.i.d. errors]. (2) In @francisco2004plug the variance
factor is estimated under an AR(1) model, which is usually a
misspecification. (3) Data-driven estimation of the derivatives are also
included in the current package. Moreover, the user can obtain any
estimate with fixed bandwidths chosen beforehand. A function for kernel
smoothing is also built-in for comparison.

The smoots package complements the Comprehensive R Archive Network
(CRAN), as already existing base R functions or CRAN packages for local
polynomial smoothing either do not implement an automated bandwidth
selection or, if such bandwidth algorithms do exist, they are only
suitable for data with i.i.d. (independently and identically
distributed) errors, which is an assumption that is often violated for
time series. In more detail, notwithstanding that the
[stats](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=stats) package offers the
functions lowess() and loess() for computing the local polynomial
estimates of the regression function given one or multiple predictor
variables, a smoothing bandwidth has to be selected arbitrarily in both
cases. Similar functionality is provided by the
[locpol](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=locpol) [@ojeda2018locpol],
[KernSmooth](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=KernSmooth)
[@wand2021KernSmooth] and
[lokern](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=lokern)
[@herrmann2021lokern] packages, however, derivative estimation
approaches and various bandwidth selection algorithms for the regression
function, such as the leave-one-out estimator [@allen1974relationship]
and the plug-in algorithm by @ruppert1995effective, are built into them.
Moreover, within lokern, the bandwidth for estimating the first or
second derivative of the regression function can be selected
automatically. Nevertheless, these traditional data-driven bandwidth
selection approaches are only suitable in case of data with i.i.d.
errors [@hart1991kernel; @altman1990kernel; @opsomer1997nonparametric]
and can therefore often not be considered for time series. Explicit CRAN
packages for detrending a time series nonparametrically are
[rmaf](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=rmaf) [@qiu2015rmaf] and
[mFilter](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=mFilter)
[@balcilar2019mFilter]. While with rmaf, a fully data-driven refined
moving average and a cubic smoothing spline, which requires a manually
selected smoothness parameter, can be applied, the trend as well as the
cyclical component of a time series can be extracted with the filters
implemented in the mFilter package like the Baxter-King
[@baxter1999measuring] or Hodrick-Prescott [@hodrick1997postwar] filters
among others. However, all filtering functions in the mFilter package
are not fully data-driven. Instead, they make use of default values
recommended within scientific literature. Thus, to our knowledge, there
are not any packages on CRAN that implement a data-driven local
polynomial regression for the trend of a time series or its derivatives.

The methodological and computational background for the smoots package
is summarized briefly hereinafter. For further details we refer the
reader to @fenggriesfritz2020 and references therein. Our focus is to
illustrate the wide application spectrum of the smoots package for
semiparametric modeling of time series. We propose to estimate the
nonparametric trend using the current package in the first stage and to
fit e.g. an ARMA model to the residuals with the standard arima()
function of the stats package in R. This idea is first shown with
monthly Northern Hemisphere temperature changes data obtained from the
website of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA).
Then the proposal is applied to the log-transformation of the quarterly
US-GDP data, retrieved from the website of the Federal Reserve Bank of
St. Louis, using a semiparametric log-local-linear growth model.
Moreover, two new semiparametric models for financial time series are
proposed to show further application of this package. Firstly, a
Semi-Log-GARCH model is defined by introducing a scale function into the
Log-GARCH (logarithmic GARCH)
[@pantula1986; @geweke1986; @milhoj1987multi]. The latter is a special
extension of the seminal ARCH [autoregressive conditional
heteroskedasticity, @engle1982arch] and GARCH [generalized ARCH,
@bollerslev1986garch] models and is just a slightly restricted ARMA
model for the log-transformation of the squared returns [see e.g.
@sucarrat2019log]. The usefulness of the Log-GARCH has recently been
rediscovered by @francq2013garch. The application of this proposal is
illustrated by the DAX returns collected from Yahoo Finance. Secondly, a
Semi-Log-ACD model is proposed as an extension of the Type I Log-ACD
[@bauwens2000lacd], which is closely related to the Semi-Log-GARCH. Like
the ACD [autoregressive conditional duration, @engle1998acd] model, the
Semi-Log-ACD can be applied to different non-negative financial data,
such as realized volatilities and trading volumes. In this paper, this
new model is applied to the CBOE Volatility Index (VIX) obtained from
Yahoo Finance. Datasets for all of those examples are built in the
proposed package. The smoots package can be applied to suitable time
series from other research areas. In addition, the smoots package
provides a useful tool for teaching time series analysis, which helps a
lecturer to obtain automatically detrended real data examples to show
the application of parametric time series models.

The methods and IPI-algorithms are summarized in the following two
sections. The general usage of the R functions is then described in
another section. Three further sections illustrate the applications of
those functions in simple cases and with respect to the Semi-Log-GARCH
and the Semi-Log-ACD.

# Local polynomial regression for time series {#sec:locpoly}

The main algorithm of the smoots package is a fully automatic
non-parametric procedure for estimating a deterministic trend in an
additive time series model with observations $y_{t}$, $t=1, ..., n$. The
data under consideration can for example be from environmental
statistics, economics or finance. The basic nonparametric time series
model is defined by $$\label{eq:Semi-MTS}
y_t= m\left(x_t\right) + \xi_t,$$ where $x_t=t/n$ denotes the rescaled
time, $m$ is a smooth function and $\xi_t$ is a zero mean stationary
process. This model defines a nonparametric approach for
trend-stationary time series. Let $\gamma_{\xi}\left(\tau\right)$ denote
the acf (autocovariances) of $\xi_t$. Under the regularity conditions
given in @buhlmann1996locally, a data-driven IPI-algorithm for
estimating the variance factor in the asymptotically optimal bandwidth
can be developed. As indicated by @fenggriesfritz2020, the required
conditions are fulfilled by an ARMA process with finite eighth moment.
However, models with long-memory errors are excluded by those
assumptions.

The local polynomial estimator of $m^{\left(\nu\right)}\left(x\right)$,
the $\nu$-th derivative of $m$, is obtained by minimizing
$$\label{eq:LWSformula}
Q = \sum_{t=1}^{n}\left\{y_{t} - \sum_{j=0}^{p}b_{j}\left(x\right)\left(x_{t} - x\right)^{j}\right\}^{2}W\left(\frac{x_{t} - x}{h}\right),$$
where $h$ is the bandwidth, $W$ is a second order kernel function with
compact support $\left[-1, 1\right]$ and is used here as the weighting
function, and $p$ is the order of polynomial. It is assumed that $p-\nu$
is odd. We have
$\hat m^{\left(\nu\right)}\left(x\right)=\nu!\hat b_\nu\left(x\right)$,
which is asymptotically equivalent to some kernel regression with a
$k$-th order kernel $K\left(u\right)$ and automatic boundary correction,
where $k=p+1$. In this paper, the following weighting functions are
considered: $$\label{eq:kernelfunc}
W\left(u\right) = C_{\mu}\left(1-u^{2}\right)^{\mu}\mathbb{I}_{\left[-1,1\right]}\left(u\right),$$
where $C_{\mu}$ is a standardization constant that is indeed irrelevant
for calculating the weights in
[\[eq:kernelfunc\]](#eq:kernelfunc){reference-type="eqref"
reference="eq:kernelfunc"} and $\mu=0,$ 1, \..., is a smoothness
parameter. For automatic bandwidth selection using the smoots package,
only $\mu = 0, 1, 2$ and $3$ are allowed, corresponding to the use of
the uniform, Epanechnikov, bisquare and triweight kernels, respectively.

An IPI-algorithm is developed based on the asymptotically optimal
bandwidth $h_A$, which is the minimizer of the AMISE (asymptotic mean
integrated squared error): $$\label{eq:AMISE}
\text{AMISE}\left(h\right) = h^{2\left(k-\nu\right)}\frac{I\left[m^{\left(k\right)}\right]\beta^{2}}{\left(k!\right)^{2}} + \frac{2\pi c_{f}\left(d_{b}-c_{b}\right)R\left(K\right)}{nh^{2\nu+1}}\text{,}$$
where
$I\left[m^{\left(k\right)}\right] = \int_{c_{b}}^{d_{b}}\left[m^{\left(k\right)}\left(x\right)\right]^{2}dx$,
$\beta=\int_{-1}^{1}u^{k}K\left(u\right)du$,
$R\left(K\right)=\int_{-1}^{1}K^{2}\left(u\right)du$,
$c_{f} = f\left(0\right)$ is the value of the spectral density at the
frequency zero and $0\le c_b < d_b\le 1$ are introduced to reduce the
effect of the estimates at the boundary points. Then we have
$$\label{eq:hOpt}
h_{A}=n^{-\frac{1}{2k+1}}\left(\frac{2\nu + 1}{2\left(k - \nu\right)}\frac{2\pi c_{f}\left(k!\right)^{2}\left(d_{b}-c_{b}\right)R\left(K\right)}{I\left[m^{\left(k\right)}\right]\beta^{2}}\right)^{\frac{1}{2k+1}}.$$

After estimating and removing the nonparametric trend, any suitable
parametric model can be fitted to the residuals for further econometric
analysis. For instance, we can assume that $\xi_t$ follows an ARMA
model: $$\label{eq:Semi-ARMA} 
\xi_t= \varphi_1\xi_{t-1} + ... + \varphi_r\xi_{t-r}+ \psi_1\varepsilon_{t-1} + ... + \psi_s\varepsilon_{t-s}+\varepsilon_t,$$
where $\varepsilon_t$ are i.i.d. innovations. A semiparametric ARMA
(Semi-ARMA) model is then defined by
[\[eq:Semi-MTS\]](#eq:Semi-MTS){reference-type="eqref"
reference="eq:Semi-MTS"} and
[\[eq:Semi-ARMA\]](#eq:Semi-ARMA){reference-type="eqref"
reference="eq:Semi-ARMA"}.

# The proposed IPI-algorithms {#sec:ipi}

Since both $c_{f}$ and $I\left[m^{\left(k\right)}\right]$ in
[\[eq:hOpt\]](#eq:hOpt){reference-type="eqref" reference="eq:hOpt"} are
unknown, we need to obtain and insert appropriate estimates of these two
quantities into this formula to achieve a selected bandwidth
$\hat h_{A}$. However, the estimation of $c_{f}$ and
$I\left[m^{\left(k\right)}\right]$ requires the use of two additional
bandwidths. Hence, iterative bandwidth selection procedures should be
employed. The estimation of $I\left[m^{\left(k\right)}\right]$ is not
influenced by the correlation structure, which can be simply obtained by
means of established IPI-algorithms for models with independent errors.
Consequently, solely a comprehensive review of the estimation approach
for $c_{f}$ will be given.

## Data-driven estimation of $c_f$ {#sec:cfEst}

Let $r_{t, {\rm V}}=y_t-\hat m_{\rm V}$ denote the residuals obtained
from a pilot estimate using a bandwidth $h_{\rm V}$ and denote the
sample acf calculated from $r_{t, {\rm V}}$ by
$\hat \gamma\left(l\right)$. In this paper we propose to use the
following lag-window estimator of $c_f$: $$\label{eq:cfbw}
\hat c_{f, {\rm M}}=\frac{1}{2\pi}\sum_{l=-M}^{M} w_l \hat \gamma\left(l\right),$$
where $w_l=l/\left(M+0.5\right)$ are weights calculated according to
some lag-window with the window-width $M$. And, $M$ will be selected by
the following IPI-algorithm proposed by @fenggriesfritz2020, which is
adjusted from that of @buhlmann1996locally.

1.  Let $M_0=\left[n/2\right]$ be the initial window-width, where
    $\left[\cdot\right]$ denotes the integer part.

2.  Global steps: Estimate
    $\int\left(f\left(\lambda\right)^2\right)d\lambda$ in the $j$-th
    iteration following @buhlmann1996locally. Denote by
    $\int f^{\left(1\right)}\left(\lambda\right) d\lambda$ the integral
    of the first generalized derivative of $f\left(\lambda\right)$.
    Estimate it using the window-width
    $M_j'=\left[M_{j-1}/n^{2/21}\right]$, the proposal in
    @buhlmann1996locally and the Bartlett-window. Obtain $M_j$ by
    inserting this quantity into Eq. (5) in @buhlmann1996locally. Carry
    out this procedure iteratively until convergence is reached or until
    a maximum of 20 iterations. Denote the selected $M$ by $\hat M_G$.

3.  Local adaptation at $\lambda=0$: Calculate
    $\int f^{\left(1\right)}\left(\lambda\right) d\lambda$ again using
    $M'=\left[\hat M_G/n^{2/21}\right]$. Obtain the finally selected
    window-width $\hat M$ by inserting the estimates into the formula of
    the local optimal bandwidth at $\lambda=0$ in (5) of
    @buhlmann1996locally.

It is proposed to use the Bartlett-window throughout the whole algorithm
for simplicity. If $\hat M$ converges, it is usually not affected by the
starting value $M_0$. Hence, any $1\le M_0\le\left[n/2\right]$ can be
used in the proposed algorithm.

## The IPI-algorithm for estimating $m$ {#sec:trendEst}

In this subsection the data-driven IPI-algorithm for selecting the
bandwidth for local linear and local cubic estimators $\hat m$, with
$k=2$ and 4, respectively, under correlated errors will be described.
Note that, although the variance factor $c_{f}$ can be estimated well
from residuals of $\hat m$, @fenggriesfritz2020 showed that the
asymptotically optimal bandwidth for estimating $c_{f}$ should be
${\rm CF}\cdot h_A$, not $h_A$ itself, where $$\label{eq:CF}
{\rm CF}= \left\{2k\left[\frac{2 K\left(0\right)}{R\left(K\right)}- 1\right]\right\}^{1/\left(2k+1\right)}$$
is a correction factor to obtain the asymptotically optimal bandwidth
for estimating $\hat c_f$ from $\hat h$, which is the same as given in
@feng2009simple and is always bigger than 1. Theoretically, $c_{f}$
should be estimated from $r_{t, {\rm V}}$ obtained with the bandwidth
${\rm CF}\cdot \hat h$. The proposed main IPI-algorithm for selecting
the bandwidth proceeds as follows.

1.  Start with an initial bandwidth $h_0$ given beforehand.

2.  Obtain $r_{t, {\rm V}}$ using $h_{j-1}$ or ${\rm CF}\cdot h_{j-1}$
    and estimate $c_f$ from $r_{t, {\rm V}}$ as proposed above.

3.  Let $\alpha=5/7$ or $5/9$ for $p=1$, and $\alpha=9/11$ or $9/13$ for
    $p=3$, respectively. Estimate $I\left[m^{\left(k\right)}\right]$
    with $h_{d,j}=h_{j-1}^{\alpha}$ and a local polynomial of order
    $p_d=p+2$. We obtain $$\label{eq:bi}
    	h_j=\left(\frac{\left[k!\right]^2}{2k \beta^2} \, \frac{2\pi \hat
    		c_f \left(d_b -c_b\right) R\left(K\right)}{I\left[\hat m^{\left(k\right)}\right]}\right)^{1/\left(2k+1\right)} \cdot
    	n^{-1/\left(2k+1\right)}.$$

4.  Increase $j$ by 1. Repetitively carry out Steps $ii)$ and $iii)$
    until convergence is reached or until for example $J=20$ iterations
    are achieved. Let $\hat h=h_{j}$ be the selected bandwidth.

In the developed package the initial bandwidth $h_0=0.15$ for both $p=1$
and $p=3$ is used. Also, for both $p=1$ and $p=3$, the default value
$c_b=1-d_b=0.05$ is proposed to reduce the effect of the estimates at
the boundary points. That is, the bandwidth is selected only using
$90\%$ of the observations in the middle part. The bandwidth
$h_{d,j}=h_{j-1}^{\alpha}$ for estimating the $k$-th derivative is
roughly fixed using a so-called EIM (exponential inflation method). The
first $\alpha$ value is chosen so that
$I\left[\hat m^{\left(k\right)}\right]$ and hence $\hat h$ will achieve
their optimal rates of convergence. Now, the algorithm will be denoted
by AlgA. If the second $\alpha$ value is used,
$\hat m^{\left(k\right)}$, but not $\hat h$, will achieve its optimal
rate of convergence. This algorithm is called AlgB. And $\hat h$
selected by AlgB is larger than that by AlgA. For further details on
those topics we refer the reader to @fenggriesfritz2020.

## Data-driven estimation of $m'$ and $m''$ {#sec:derivEst}

The proposed IPI-algorithm can be easily adapted to select bandwidths
for estimating $\hat m^{\left(\nu\right)}$. In the following, only the
cases with $\nu=1$ or $2$ are considered, where $c_f$ is estimated by
means of a data-driven pilot estimate $\hat m$ of the order $p_p$, say.
Then $m^{\left(\nu\right)}$ will be estimated with $p=\nu+1$ and
$k=\nu+2$. As before, $m^{\left(k\right)}$ for calculating the bias
factor will be estimated with $p_d=p+2$ and a correspondingly inflated
bandwidth. This leads to the following two-stage procedure.

1.  In the first stage $\hat c_f$ is obtained by the main IPI-algorithm
    with $p_p=1$ or $p_p=3$.

2.  Then an IPI-procedure as proposed above to select the bandwidth for
    estimating $m^{\left(\nu\right)}$ according to
    [\[eq:hOpt\]](#eq:hOpt){reference-type="eqref" reference="eq:hOpt"}
    is carried out with fixed $\hat c_f$ obtained in i).

Note that $\hat m^{\left(\nu\right)}$ is asymptotically equivalent to
some kernel estimator with boundary correction. Explicit forms of the
equivalent kernels for estimating $m^{\left(\nu\right)}$ in the middle
part may be found in @mueller1988. The corresponding inflation factors
(i.e. the $\alpha$ values) are determined by $p$ or $k$.

# Practical implementation in R {#sec:implementR}

The package smoots developed based on the algorithms described in the
last section consists of five directly usable functions, two S3 methods
and four datasets as examples. The first four functions are called
msmooth(), tsmooth(), gsmooth() and knsmooth(), designed for estimating
the trend in different ways. Data-driven estimation can be carried out
by each of the first two functions, where msmooth() is a user-friendlier
simplified version of tsmooth(). Local polynomial estimation of
$m^{\left(\nu\right)}$ and kernel smoothing of $m$ with an arbitrary
bandwidth fixed beforehand can be carried out by gsmooth() and
knsmooth(), respectively. In the first case, one should choose $p$ such
that $p-\nu$ is odd to avoid the boundary problem. Those functions allow
a flexible application of this package by an experienced user.
Data-driven estimation of the first or second derivative can be obtained
by dsmooth().

The functions for selecting the bandwidth will be described in more
detail. Moreover, for simplicity, shared arguments between functions
will only be discussed once. With

::: center
tsmooth(y,  p,  mu,  Mcf,  InfR,  bStart,  bvc,  bb,  cb,  method),
:::

the trend in equidistant and trend-stationary time series with
short-memory can be estimated via an automated local polynomial. Its
arguments are as follows.

-   y is the input time series.

-   p reflects the order of polynomial and currently only p = 1 (local
    linear) and p = 3 (local cubic) are selectable.

-   mu corresponds to the smoothness parameter $\mu$ of the second order
    kernel function
    [\[eq:kernelfunc\]](#eq:kernelfunc){reference-type="eqref"
    reference="eq:kernelfunc"} used for weighting. Only 0, 1, 2 and 3
    are valid options.

-   Mcf defines the method for estimating $c_f$. For Mcf = \"NP\", the
    default, $c_f$ is estimated nonparametrically as described in the
    section [*Data-driven estimation of $c_f$*](#sec:cfEst). If \"AR\",
    \"MA\" or \"ARMA\" are selected, $\xi_t$ in model
    [\[eq:Semi-MTS\]](#eq:Semi-MTS){reference-type="eqref"
    reference="eq:Semi-MTS"} is assumed to follow an AR, MA or ARMA
    process, respectively, during the bandwidth selection and thus,
    $c_f$ is estimated parametrically.

-   InfR sets the inflation rate $\alpha$ considered for the bandwidth
    (see also Step iii) in the section [*The IPI-algorithm for
    estimating $m$*](#sec:trendEst)). The options are InfR = \"Opt\",
    which corresponds to $\alpha = 5/7$ for a local linear and
    $\alpha = 9/11$ for a local cubic regression, InfR = \"Nai\" with
    $\alpha = 5/9$ and $\alpha = 9/13$ for local linear and local cubic
    regressions, respectively, and InfR = \"Var\", which always sets
    $\alpha = 1/2$.

-   bStart is the (relative) starting bandwidth for the bandwidth
    selection algorithm. The default is bStart = 0.15. Note that
    $\hat{h}$ is usually not affected by the initial value.

-   With the argument bvc the estimation of $c_f$ can be adjusted even
    further. By setting bvc = \"Y\", the bandwidth for estimating $c_f$
    will be enlarged by the factor CF as in
    [\[eq:CF\]](#eq:CF){reference-type="eqref" reference="eq:CF"}. CF is
    omitted for bvc = \"N\".

-   bb describes the boundary method. If bb = 0 is selected, the number
    of observations considered for smoothing is decreasing towards the
    boundaries, while it is constant throughout for bb = 1.

-   cb is the proportion of observations at each boundary that is
    omitted in the bandwidth selection process.

-   Via method the final smoothing method, after the bandwidth has been
    selected, can be defined. The default method = \"lpr\" corresponds
    to local polynomial estimates, whereas with method = \"kr\" a kernel
    regression is conducted.

A simplified version of tsmooth() for estimating a time series trend
with a data-driven local polynomial is

::: center
msmooth(y,  p,  mu,  bStart,  alg,  method),
:::

which shares most of its arguments with tsmooth(). The only unknown
argument is alg.

-   alg defines specific argument settings of tsmooth() as named
    subalgorithms. The two algorithms AlgA and AlgB described in the
    section [*The IPI-algorithm for estimating $m$*](#sec:trendEst) can
    be directly chosen by alg = \"A\" and alg = \"B\", respectively.

In accordance with @fenggriesfritz2020, we propose the use of AlgA with
the optimal inflation factor for local linear regression. For local
cubic regression with a moderate $n$, AlgB with the stronger inflation
factor should be used. If $n$ is big enough, e.g. bigger than 400, the
combination of $p = 3$ and AlgA will also lead to suitable results. In
case when slight over smoothing is wished/required, the inflation factor
\"Nai\" or even \"Var\" should be employed.

To estimate the first or second derivative of a time series trend with a
data-driven local polynomial, the function

::: center
dsmooth(y,  d,  mu,  pp,  bStart.p,  bStart)
:::

should be employed. With this function, the first and second derivatives
are always estimated using a local quadratic and local cubic regression,
respectively. To obtain $\hat{c}_f$, a data-driven pilot estimate of the
trend function via tsmooth() is computed.

-   d specifies the order of derivative of the trend that will be
    estimated. Currently, d = 1 and d = 2 are valid options.

-   pp corresponds to the order of polynomial considered for the pilot
    estimate of the trend function. pp = 1 and pp = 3 are available.

-   bStart.p is the starting bandwidth for the data-driven pilot
    estimate of the trend.

Note that here, bStart is the initial bandwidth considered in the
bandwidth selection for the derivative series. For further details on
the functions we refer the reader to the user's guideline for this
package. Beside the above functions, two S3 methods are also built in
the package: a print() and a plot() method for objects of class
\"smoots\", a newly introduced class of objects created by the smoots
package. They allow for a quick and detailed overview of the estimation
results. The \"smoots\" objects themselves are generally lists
consisting of different components such as input data and estimation
results.

# Simple application of smoots {#sec:application}

In this and the next two sections, the wide applicability of the above
mentioned functions will be illustrated by four real data examples.
Those datasets are built in the package so that the reader can also use
them. They are: tempNH, gdpUS, dax and vix, which contain observations
of the mean monthly temperature changes of the Northern Hemisphere, the
US GDP and daily financial data of the German stock index (DAX) and the
CBOE Volatility Index (VIX), respectively. For further information see
also the documentation on the data within the smoots package. Since the
package is available on CRAN, the commands install.packages(\"smoots\")
and library(smoots) can be used to install it and attach it within the
current R environment.

## Direct application of the Semi-ARMA {#sec:SemiARMAEx1}

To show the application of the additive Semi-ARMA model defined by
[\[eq:Semi-MTS\]](#eq:Semi-MTS){reference-type="eqref"
reference="eq:Semi-MTS"} and
[\[eq:Semi-ARMA\]](#eq:Semi-ARMA){reference-type="eqref"
reference="eq:Semi-ARMA"}, the time series of the mean monthly Northern
Hemisphere temperature changes from 1880 to 2018 (NHTM) is chosen. The
data are downloaded from the website of the NASA. For this purpose, the
function tsmooth() is applied. The used settings of the arguments for
this function are equivalent to those in algorithm *A* with $p=1$.

::: example
tempChange \<- smoots::tempNH$Change
  est_temp <- smoots::tsmooth(tempChange, p = 1, mu = 2, Mcf = "NP", InfR = "Opt", 
    bStart = 0.1, bvc = "Y", method = "lpr")
  d1_temp <- smoots::dsmooth(tempChange, d = 1, mu = 2, pp = 3, bStart.p = 0.2, 
    bStart = 0.15)
  d2_temp <- smoots::dsmooth(tempChange, d = 2, mu = 3, pp = 1, bStart.p = 0.1, 
    bStart = 0.2)
\end{example}
Figure~\ref{fig:ex1}(a) shows the observations together with the estimated trend. Here, the selected bandwidth is 0.1221. 
We see, the estimated trend fits the data very well. In particular, the trend increases steadily after 1970 that might be a signal for possible global warming in the last decades. 
The residuals are displayed in Figure~\ref{fig:ex1}(b), which look quite stationary. This indicates that Model \eqref{eq:Semi-MTS} is a suitable approach for this time series.
Moreover, Figures~\ref{fig:ex1}(c) and \ref{fig:ex1}(d) illustrate the data-driven estimates of the first and second derivatives of the trend respectively, which fit the features of the trend function very well and provide us further details about the global temperature changes. 
\begin{example}
  arma1 <- stats::arima(est_temp$res, order = c(1, 0, 1), include.mean =
FALSE)
:::

Consequently, an ARMA(1, 1) model is fitted to the residual series
$\tilde{\xi}_t = y_t - \hat{m}(x_t)$ using the arima() function in R,
which results in $$\label{eq:resultEx1}
\tilde{\xi}_{t} = 0.7489\tilde{\xi}_{t-1} - 0.3332\varepsilon_{t-1} +\varepsilon_{t}.$$
We see, the dependence of errors is dominated by a strong positive AR
parameter with a moderate negative MA coefficient.

## A semiparametric log-local-linear growth model

A well-known approach in developing economics is the log-linear growth
model. Assume that the log-transformation of a macroeconomic time series
follows Models [\[eq:Semi-MTS\]](#eq:Semi-MTS){reference-type="eqref"
reference="eq:Semi-MTS"} and
[\[eq:Semi-ARMA\]](#eq:Semi-ARMA){reference-type="eqref"
reference="eq:Semi-ARMA"}, we achieve a semiparametric local polynomial,
in particular a local-linear extension of this theory. To show this
application, the series of the quarterly US-GDP from the first quarter
of 1947 to the second quarter of 2019, downloaded from the Federal
Reserve Bank of St. Louis, is chosen. Data-driven local linear
regression is applied to estimate the trend from the log-data using
*AlgA* with the selected bandwidth 0.1325. A kernel regression estimate
using the same bandwidth is also carried out for comparison.

::: example
l_gdp \<- log(smoots::gdpUS$GDP)  
  gdp_t1 <- smoots::msmooth(l_gdp, p = 1, mu = 1, bStart = 0.1, alg = "A", 
    method = "lpr")
  gdp_t2 <- smoots::msmooth(l_gdp, p = 1, mu = 1, bStart = 0.1, alg = "A", 
    method = "kr")
  gdp_d1 <- smoots::dsmooth(l_gdp, d = 1, mu = 1, pp = 1, bStart.p = 0.1, 
    bStart = 0.15)
  gdp_d2 <- smoots::dsmooth(l_gdp, d = 2, mu = 1, pp = 1, bStart.p = 0.1, 
    bStart = 0.2) 
\end{example}
The results together with the log-data are displayed in Figure~\ref{fig:ex2}(a). We see that the two trend estimates in the middle part coincide with each other. They differ from each other only at the boundary points and the kernel estimate is affected by a clear boundary problem. Thus, the local linear method should be used. Residuals of this estimate are shown in Figure~\ref{fig:ex2}(b). Again, the estimated first and second derivatives are given in Figures~\ref{fig:ex2}(c) and \ref{fig:ex2}(d), respectively, which help us to discover more detailed features of the economic development in the US. 
\begin{example}
  arma2 <- stats::arima(gdp_t1$res, order = c(1, 0, 1), include.mean =
FALSE)
:::

Furthermore, the following ARMA(1, 1) model is obtained from the
residuals: $$\label{eq:resultEx2}
\tilde{\xi}_{t} = 0.9079\tilde{\xi}_{t-1} + 0.2771\varepsilon_{t-1} + \varepsilon_{t}.$$

# The Semi-Log-GARCH model {#sec:SemiLogGARCH}

Most of the GARCH extensions, including the Log-GARCH
[@pantula1986; @geweke1986; @milhoj1987multi], are defined for
stationary return series. Recently, @francq2013garch rediscovered the
usefulness of the Log-GARCH. In practice it is however found that the
unconditional variance of financial returns may change slowly over time
and are hence non-stationary. To overcome this problem a semiparametric
GARCH (Semi-GARCH) approach is proposed by @feng2004sim, by defining the
return series as a product of a (deterministic) smooth scale function
and a GARCH model. Another well-known closely related approach is the
Spline-GARCH introduced by @engle2008spline. In this paper we will
introduce a Semi-Log-GARCH (semiparametric Log-GARCH), defined as a
Log-GARCH with a smooth scale function. We propose to estimate the scale
function in the Semi-Log-GARCH model based on the log-transformation of
the squared returns as proposed by @engle2008spline.

Denote the centralized returns by $r_t$, $t=1, ..., n$. The
Semi-Log-GARCH model is defined by $$\label{eq:rt}
r_{t} = \sqrt{v\left(x_{t}\right)}\zeta_{t} \ \text{ with } \ \zeta_{t} = \sqrt{h_{t}}\eta_{t} \ \text{ and}$$
$$\label{eq:lnht}
\ln\left(h_{t}\right) = \omega + \sum_{i=1}^{l}\alpha_{i}\ln\left(\zeta_{t-i}^{2}\right) + \sum_{j=1}^{s}\beta_{j}\ln\left(h_{t-j}\right),$$
where $v\left(x_{t}\right) > 0$ is a smooth local variance component,
$h_t>0$ are conditional variances and $\eta_{t}$ are i.i.d. random
variables with zero mean and unit variance. It is assumed that $\zeta_t$
also has unit variance and $\zeta_{t}\ne 0$ almost surely, so that the
model is well-defined. Let $y_t=\ln\left(r_t^2\right)$,
$\xi_t=\ln\left(\zeta_t^2\right)-\mu_{lz}$ and
$m\left(x_t\right)=\ln\left[v\left(x_t\right)\right] +\mu_{lz}$, where
$\mu_{lz}=E\left[\ln\left(\zeta_t^2\right)\right]$. We see that the
log-transformation of $r_t^2$ of the Semi-Log-GARCH model has the form
$y_t=m\left(x_t\right)+\xi_t$, which is a special case of Model
[\[eq:Semi-MTS\]](#eq:Semi-MTS){reference-type="eqref"
reference="eq:Semi-MTS"}. Furthermore, define
$\varepsilon_t=\ln\left(\eta_t^2\right)-\mu_{le}$ with
$\mu_{le}=E\left[\ln\left(\eta_t^2\right)\right]$, which are i.i.d. zero
mean innovations in the stationary process $\xi_t$. According to
[@francq2018exponential], $\xi_t$ has the following ARMA representation:
$$\label{eq:lgARMA}
\xi_t = \sum_{i=1}^{l^{*}}\varphi_{i}\xi_{t-i} + \sum_{j=1}^{s}\psi_{j}\varepsilon_{t-j} + \varepsilon_{t}$$
with $l^{*} = \text{max}(l, s)$. Thus, the Semi-Log-GARCH model is
equivalent to a Semi-ARMA of the log-transformation of $r_t^2$ with the
restriction that the AR order should not be less than the MA order.
Hence, this model can be simply estimated using the smoots package and
the arima() function of the stats package. To obtain the total
volatilities $\sigma_t=\sqrt{v\left(x_{t}\right)h_{t}}$, we suggest to
utilize the three-step estimation procedure as proposed in Section 3.3
of @sucarrat2019log, however, we recommend to explicitly conduct the
auxiliary regression in Step 1 in @sucarrat2019log by using a
data-driven local polynomial.

1.  Obtain estimates of the nonparametric trend function
    $\hat{m}\left(x_t\right)$ in $y_t$ via the smoots package.

2.  Fit an ARMA($l^{*}, s$) model
    [\[eq:lgARMA\]](#eq:lgARMA){reference-type="eqref"
    reference="eq:lgARMA"} to the residuals
    $\tilde{\xi}_t=y_t-\hat{m}\left(x_t\right)$, for example with the
    arima() function of the stats package, and compute the ARMA
    residuals $\hat{\varepsilon}_t$.

3.  Consider
    $\hat{\mu}_{le} = -\ln\left[\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^{n}\exp\left(\hat{\varepsilon}_i\right)\right]$
    as an estimator of the log-moment
    $E\left[\ln\left(\eta_t^2\right)\right]$. Then the total
    volatilities are estimated as $$\label{eq:volEstimator}
    	  \hat{\sigma}_t=\exp\left\{ \left[\tilde{\xi}_t - \hat{\varepsilon}_t + \hat{m}\left(x_t\right) - \hat{\mu}_{le}\right] / 2 \right\}.$$

Estimates of the conditional volatilities are also calculable similarly
by following the same three-step procedure while replacing
[\[eq:volEstimator\]](#eq:volEstimator){reference-type="eqref"
reference="eq:volEstimator"} with
$\sqrt{\hat{h}_t}=\exp\left[\left( \tilde{\xi}_t - \hat{\varepsilon}_t + \hat{\mu}_{lz} - \hat{\mu}_{le} \right)/2\right]$,
where we suggest
$\hat{\mu}_{lz}=-\ln\left[\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^{n}\exp\left(\tilde{\xi}_i\right)\right]$.
An important characteristic of the illustrated estimation procedure is
that explicit estimates of the Log-GARCH parameters $\omega$,
$\alpha_i$, for $1 \leq i \leq p$, and $\beta_j$, for $1 \leq j \leq q$,
are not required for computing $\hat{\sigma}_t$ or $\sqrt{\hat{h}_t}$
[@sucarrat2019log]. If, however, necessary, estimates could be derived
by considering the relationships between the coefficients in
[\[eq:lnht\]](#eq:lnht){reference-type="eqref" reference="eq:lnht"} and
[\[eq:lgARMA\]](#eq:lgARMA){reference-type="eqref"
reference="eq:lgARMA"}, which are $\alpha_i = \varphi_{i} + \psi_{i}$,
$\beta_{j} = -\psi_{j}$, where the non-existing coefficients are assumed
to be zero, and
$\omega=\left(1-\sum_{i=1}^{l^{*}}\varphi_{i}\right)\mu_{lz}-\left(1+\sum_{j=1}^{s}\psi_{j}\right)\mu_{le}$.
Note that the parametric part of the Semi-Log-GARCH can also be
estimated directly using the R package
[lgarch](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=lgarch)
[@sucarrat2015lgarch]. Nonetheless, this approach will not be considered
in the current paper.

In the following, the DAX series from 1990 to July 2019 downloaded from
Yahoo Finance is chosen to show the application of the Semi-Log-GARCH
model. Note that an observed return can be sometimes exactly zero. To
overcome this problem, the log-transformation is calculated for the
squared centralized returns, which are a.s. non-zero. This would even be
a necessary treatment, if the returns had a very small, but non-zero
mean.

::: example
\# Calculate the centralized log-returns dax_close \<-
smoots::dax$Close; dax <- diff(log(dax_close))
  rt <- dax - mean(dax); yt <- log(rt ^ 2) 
\end{example}  
Subsequently, the previously described estimation procedure according to \citet{sucarrat2019log} is implemented by estimating the trend function in the logarithm of the squared returns \texorpdfstring%
{{\normalfont\ttfamily\hyphenchar\font=-1 yt}}%
{yt} with the function \texorpdfstring%
{{\normalfont\ttfamily\hyphenchar\font=-1 msmooth()}}%
{msmooth()} of the \texorpdfstring%
{{\normalfont\fontseries{b}\selectfont smoots}}%
{smoots} package. More specifically, a local cubic trend is fitted, while employing \emph{AlgA}.
\begin{example}
  # Step 1: Estimate the trend in the log-transformed data using 'smoots'                                    
  estim3 <- smoots::msmooth(yt, p = 3, alg = "A")
  m_xt <- estim3$ye

\# Step 2: Fit an ARMA model to the residuals xi \<- estim3$res
  arma3 <- arima(xi, order = c(1, 0, 1), include.mean = FALSE)

  # Step 3: Estimate further quantities and the total volatilities
  mu_le <- -log(mean(exp(arma3$residuals))) vol \<- exp((xi -
arma3$residuals + m_xt - mu_le) / 2)
\end{example}
For reference, \texorpdfstring%
{{\normalfont\ttfamily\hyphenchar\font=-1 estim3.2 <- \ smoots::msmooth(yt, \ p = 1, \ alg = "A")}}%
{estim3.2 <- \ smoots::msmooth(yt, \ p = 1, \ alg = "A")} is called, i.e. a local linear trend under consideration of \emph{AlgA} is estimated as well. The centralized log-returns and the log-transformed data with the two estimated trends (local linear: blue; local cubic: red) are displayed in Figures~\ref{fig:ex3}(a) and \ref{fig:ex3}(b). Moreover, the selected bandwidths are 0.0869 and 0.1013, respectively. Results in Figure~\ref{fig:ex3}(b) indicate that the unconditional variance of the DAX-returns changes slowly over time. Ultimately, the local cubic trend is chosen for further analysis, because here the results of the local linear approach are over-smoothed. 
The following ARMA(1, 1) model (see Step 2 in the code) is obtained from the residuals of the log-data
\begin{equation} \label{eq:resultEx3_1}
\tilde{\xi}_t = 0.9692\tilde{\xi}_{t-1} - 0.9221\varepsilon_{t-1} + \varepsilon_{t}\text{,} 
\end{equation}
whereas the re-transformed Log-GARCH(1, 1) formula is given by
\begin{equation} \label{eq:resultEx3_2}
\ln\left(h_{t}\right) = 0.0685 + 0.0471\ln\left(\zeta_{t-1}^{2}\right) + 0.9221 \ln\left(h_{t-1}\right) 
\end{equation}
following the idea of \citet{sucarrat2016log}. The estimated conditional volatility ($$) and total volatility ($\_t$) series are displayed in Figures~\ref{fig:ex3}(c) and \ref{fig:ex3}(d).

Based on the estimated local cubic trend, the corresponding estimated conditional and total volatilities are illustrated in (c) and (d), respectively.}

\section{The Semi-Log-ACD model} \label{sec:SemiLogACD}

A more general framework for modeling non-negative financial time series is the ACD \citep[autoregressive conditional duration,][]{engle1998acd} model, which corresponds to a squared GARCH model and can be applied to both high-frequency or daily financial data. Logarithmic extensions of this approach were introduced by \citet{bauwens2000lacd}, where the Type I definition (called a Log-ACD) corresponds to a squared form of the Log-GARCH. Semiparametric generalization of the Log-ACD (Semi-Log-ACD) was defined and applied to different kinds of non-negative financial data by \citet{forstinger2018modelling}. 
In this paper, the application of the Semi-Log-ACD model will be illustrated by the CBOE Volatility Index (VIX) from 1990 to July 2019, denoted by$V_t$,$t=1,
\...,
n$. The data was again downloaded from Yahoo Finance. The Semi-Log-ACD model for$V_t$is defined by
\begin{equation} \label{eq:SemiLogACD}
V_t=g\left(x_t\right) \lambda_t e_t, 
\end{equation} 
where$u_t=\_t
e_t$follows a Log-ACD and$g$is a smooth mean function in$V_t$,$\_t$is the conditional mean and$e_t$is an i.i.d. series of non-negative random variables. It is assumed that$E(\_t)=E(e_t)=1$. Further investigation on this model can be carried out similarly to that on the Semi-Log-GARCH model by replacing$r_t\^2$,$h_t$and$\_t\^2$there with$V_t$,$\_t$and$e_t$, respectively. 
The Semi-Log-ACD model can be similarly estimated. Discussion of those details is omitted. For further information we refer the reader to \citet{forstinger2018modelling} and references therein.	
\begin{example}
  # Calculate the logarithm of the index
  V <- smoots::vix$Close; lnV \<- log(V)
:::

::: example
\# Step 1: Estimate the trend in the log-transformed data using 'smoots'
estim4 \<- smoots::msmooth(lnV) estim4.2 \<- smoots::msmooth(lnV, p = 3,
alg = \"B\") m_xt \<- estim4$ye

  # Step 2: Fit an ARMA model to the residuals
  xi <- estim4$res arma4 \<- arima(xi, order = c(1, 0, 1), include.mean
= FALSE)

\# Step 3: Estimate further quantities and the total means mu_le \<-
-log(mean(exp(arma4$residuals)))                             
  means <- exp(xi - arma4$residuals + m_xt - mu_le)
:::

The original series of $V_t$ is shown in
Figure [\[fig:ex4\]](#fig:ex4){reference-type="ref"
reference="fig:ex4"}(a). The trend was estimated from the
log-transformation of $V_t$ using both *AlgA* and *AlgB* with the
selected bandwidths 0.0771 and 0.1598, respectively. The data (black),
the local linear trend (red) and the local cubic trend (blue) are
displayed in Figure [\[fig:ex4\]](#fig:ex4){reference-type="ref"
reference="fig:ex4"}(b). The results using both algorithms are quite
similar, except the local cubic estimates are smoother. From the
residuals of the local linear approach the following ARMA(1, 1) model
(see Step 2 in the code) is obtained: $$\label{eq:resultEx4_1} 
\tilde{\xi}_{t} = 0.9626\tilde{\xi}_{t-1} - 0.0707\varepsilon_{t-1} + \varepsilon_{t}.$$
Subsequently, the estimated log-form of the conditional mean function is
given by $$\label{eq:resultEx4_2}
\ln\left(\lambda_{t}\right) = 0.0010 + 0.8919\ln\left(u_{t-1}\right) + 0.0707\ln\left(\lambda_{t-1}\right).$$
The estimated conditional means and the total means in the original data
by the local linear approach are shown in
Figures [\[fig:ex4\]](#fig:ex4){reference-type="ref"
reference="fig:ex4"}(c) and [\[fig:ex4\]](#fig:ex4){reference-type="ref"
reference="fig:ex4"}(d). We see the results fit the data very well. This
model can be applied for forecasting the VIX in the future.

# Concluding remarks {#sec:conclusion}

In this paper the methodological background for developing the R package
smoots (version 1.0.1) is summarized. The usage of the main functions in
this package is explained in detail. To show the wide applicability of
this approach two new semiparametric models for analyzing financial time
series are also introduced. Data examples show that the proposed
approach can be applied to different kinds non-stationary time series
and the developed R package works very well for data-driven
implementation of those semiparametric time series models. In
particular, non-negative time series following a semiparametric
multiplicative model can be easily estimated via the log-transformation.
It is found that the errors in some examples could exhibit clear long
memory. However, the current package is developed under short memory
assumption. It is hence worthy to study the possible extension of the
current approach to semiparametric time series models with long memory
errors. Further extensions of the proposals in this paper, such as the
development of suitable forecasting procedures and tools for testing
stationarity of the errors or linearity of the deterministic trend,
should also be studied in the future and included in future versions of
the smoots package.
