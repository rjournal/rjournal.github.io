title: The smoots Package in R for Semiparametric Modeling of Trend Stationary Time
  Series
abstract: ' This paper is an introduction to the new package in R called [smoots](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=smoots)
  (smoothing time series), developed for data-driven local polynomial smoothing of
  trend-stationary time series. Functions for data-driven estimation of the first
  and second derivatives of the trend are also built-in. It is first applied to monthly
  changes of the global temperature. The quarterly US-GDP series shows that this package
  can also be well applied to a semiparametric multiplicative component model for
  non-negative time series via the log-transformation. Furthermore, we introduced
  a semiparametric Log-GARCH and a semiparametric Log-ACD model, which can be easily
  estimated by the smoots package. Of course, this package applies to suitable time
  series from any other research area. The smoots package also provides a useful tool
  for teaching time series analysis, because many practical time series follow an
  additive or a multiplicative component model. '
