title: Stratified Weibull Regression Model for Interval-Censored Data
abstract: Interval censored outcomes arise when a silent event of interest is known
  to have occurred within a specific time period determined by the times of the last
  negative and first positive diagnostic tests. There is a rich literature on parametric
  and non-parametric approaches for the analysis of interval-censored outcomes. A
  commonly used strategy is to use a proportional hazards (PH) model with the baseline
  hazard function parameterized. The proportional hazards assumption can be relaxed
  in stratified models by allowing the baseline hazard function to vary across strata
  defined by a subset of explanatory variables. In this paper, we describe and implement
  a new R package straweib, for fitting a stratified Weibull model appropriate for
  interval censored outcomes. We illustrate the R package straweib by analyzing data
  from a longitudinal oral health study on the timing of the emergence of permanent
  teeth in 4430 children.
