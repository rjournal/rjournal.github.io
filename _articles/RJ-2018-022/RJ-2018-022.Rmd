title: 'onewaytests: An R Package for One-Way Tests in Independent Groups Designs'
abstract: One-way tests in independent groups designs are the most commonly utilized
  statistical methods with applications on the experiments in medical sciences, pharmaceutical
  research, agri culture, biology, engineering, social sciences and so on. In this
  paper, we present the onewaytests package to investigate treatment effects on the
  dependent variable. The package offers the one-way tests in independent groups designs,
  which include ANOVA, Welch’s heteroscedastic F test, Welch’s heteroscedastic F test
  with trimmed means and Winsorized variances, Brown-Forsythe test, Alexander Govern
  test, James second order test and Kruskal-Wallis test. The package also provides
  pairwise comparisons, graphical approaches, and assesses variance homogeneity and
  normality of data in each group via tests and plots. A simulation study is also
  conducted to give recommendations for applied researchers on the selection of appropriate
  one-way tests under assumption violations. Furthermore, especially for non-R users,
  a user-friendly web application of the package is provided. This application is
  available at http://www.softmed.hacettepe.edu.tr/onewaytests.
