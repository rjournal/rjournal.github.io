title: 'SurvMetrics: An R package for Predictive Evaluation Metrics in Survival Analysis'
abstract: ' Recently, survival models have found vast applications in biostatistics,
  bioinformatics, reliability engineering, finance and related fields. But there are
  few R packages focusing on evaluating the predictive power of survival models. This
  lack of handy software on evaluating survival predictions hinders further applications
  of survival analysis for practitioners. In this research, we want to fill this gap
  by providing an \"all-in-one\" R package which implements most predictive evaluation
  metrics in survival analysis. In the proposed SurvMetrics R package, we implement
  concordance index for both untied and tied survival data; we give a new calculation
  process of Brier score and integrated Brier score; we also extend the applicability
  of integrated absolute error and integrated square error for real data. For models
  that can output survival time predictions, a simplified metric called mean absolute
  error is also implemented. In addition, we test the effectiveness of all these metrics
  on simulated and real survival data sets. The newly developed SurvMetrics R package
  is available on CRAN at <https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=SurvMetrics> and GitHub
  at <https://github.com/skyee1/SurvMetrics>. '
