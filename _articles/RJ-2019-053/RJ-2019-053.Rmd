title: 'spGARCH: An R-Package for Spatial and Spatiotemporal ARCH and GARCH models'
abstract: In this paper, a general overview on spatial and spatiotemporal ARCH models
  is provided. In particular, we distinguish between three different spatial ARCH-type
  models. In addition to the original definition of ?, we introduce an logarithmic
  spatial ARCH model in this paper. For this new model, maximum-likelihood estimators
  for the parameters are proposed. In addition, we consider a new complex-valued definition
  of the spatial ARCH process. Moreover, spatial GARCH models are briefly discussed.
  From a practical point of view, the use of the R-package spGARCH is demonstrated.
  To be precise, we show how the proposed spatial ARCH models can be simulated and
  summarize the variety of spatial models, which can be estimated by the estimation
  functions provided in the package. Eventually, we apply all procedures to a real-data
  example.
