title: MCMC for Generalized Linear Mixed Models with glmmBUGS
abstract: The glmmBUGS package is a bridging tool between Generalized Linear Mixed
  Models (GLMMs) in R and the BUGS language. It provides a simple way of performing
  Bayesian inference using Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods, taking a model
  formula and data frame in R and writing a BUGS model file, data file, and initial
  values files. Functions are provided to reformat and summarize the BUGS results.
  A key aim of the package is to provide files and objects that can be modified prior
  to calling BUGS, giving users a platform for customizing and extending the models
  to accommodate a wide variety of analyses.
