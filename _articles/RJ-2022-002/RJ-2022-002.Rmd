title: 'tvReg: Time-varying Coefficients in Multi-Equation Regression in R'
abstract: ' This article explains the usage of R package [tvReg](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=tvReg),
  publicly available for download from the Comprehensive R Archive Network, via its
  application to economic and finance problems. The six basic functions in this package
  cover the kernel estimation of semiparametric panel data, seemingly unrelated equations,
  vector autoregressive, impulse response, and linear regression models whose coefficients
  may vary with time or any random variable. Moreover, this package provides methods
  for the graphical display of results, forecast, prediction, extraction of the residuals
  and fitted values, bandwidth selection and nonparametric estimation of the time-varying
  variance-covariance matrix of the error term. Applications to risk management, portfolio
  management, asset management and monetary policy are used as examples of these functions
  usage. '
