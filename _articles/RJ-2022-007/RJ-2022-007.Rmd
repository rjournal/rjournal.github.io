title: 'rmonad: pipelines you can compute on'
abstract: The [rmonad](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=rmonad) package presents
  a monadic pipeline toolset for chaining functions into stateful, branching pipelines.
  As functions in the pipeline are run, their results are merged into a graph of all
  past operations. The resulting structure allows downstream computation on node documentation,
  intermediate data, performance stats, and any raised messages, warnings or errors,
  as well as the final results. [rmonad](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=rmonad)
  is a novel approach to designing reproducible, well-documented, and maintainable
  workflows in R.
