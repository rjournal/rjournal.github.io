title: 'binGroup: A Package for Group Testing'
abstract: When the prevalence of a disease or of some other binary characteristic
  is small, group testing (also known as pooled testing) is frequently used to estimate
  the prevalence and/or to identify individuals as positive or negative. We have developed
  the binGroup package as the first package designed to address the estimation problem
  in group testing. We present functions to estimate an overall prevalence for a homogeneous
  population. Also, for this setting, we have functions to aid in the very important
  choice of the group size. When individuals come from a heterogeneous population,
  our group testing regression functions can be used to estimate an individual probability
  of disease positivity by using the group observations only. We illustrate our functions
  with data from a multiple vector transfer design experiment and a human infectious
  disease prevalence study.
