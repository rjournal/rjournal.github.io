Dear Professor Hyndman,
\bigskip

We are pleased to submit the revised version of our manuscript, titled “rPDBapi: A Comprehensive R Package Interface for Accessing the Protein Data Bank,” for consideration in The R Journal. We are grateful for the insightful comments and suggestions from the reviewers. We have addressed all the feedback, including formatting improvements, reducing examples and outputs, and focusing the manuscript more clearly on the key aspects of the package.

We believe these revisions have enhanced the clarity and quality of the manuscript, and we kindly submit the revised version for your consideration.

Thank you for your time and effort in reviewing our work.
