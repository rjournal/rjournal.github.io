title: 'APCI: An R and Stata Package for Visualizing and Analyzing Age-Period-Cohort
  Data'
abstract: ' Social scientists have frequently attempted to assess the relative contribution
  of age, period, and cohort variables to the overall trend in an outcome. We develop
  an R package [APCI](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=APCI) (and Stata command
  apci) to implement the age-period-cohort-interaction (APC-I) model for estimating
  and testing age, period, and cohort patterns in various types of outcomes for pooled
  cross-sectional data and multi-cohort panel data. Package [APCI](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=APCI)
  also provides a set of functions for visualizing the data and modeling results.
  We demonstrate the usage of package [APCI](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=APCI)
  with empirical data from the Current Population Survey. We show that package [APCI](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=APCI)
  provides useful visualization and analytical tools for understanding age, period,
  and cohort trends in various types of outcomes. '
