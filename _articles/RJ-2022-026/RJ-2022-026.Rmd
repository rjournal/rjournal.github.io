# Introduction

Researchers across disciplines have long been interested in
distinguishing the relative contribution of three time-related variables
--- namely, age (i.e., how old a person is at the time of data
collection), time periods (e.g., the Great Recession 2007-2009 and the
COVID-19 pandemic beginning in December 2019), and cohort membership
(e.g., the baby boom cohort born in 1945-1964 and the Millennials born
in 1981-1996) --- to the overall trends in various outcomes (e.g., labor
force participation, attitudes, and cognitive functioning)
[@alwin_generations_2003; @clogg_cohort_1982; @pescosolido2021trends].
Decomposing the overall trends into age, period, and cohort variations
provides insight into the ways in which biological and social factors
affect these outcomes
[@hobcraft_age_1982; @heckman_using_1985; @fosse_analyzing_2019].

To quantify the relative contribution of age, period, and cohort,
@luo_age-period-cohort-interaction_2020 have recently developed a model
called the age-period-cohort-interaction (APC-I) model. The APC-I is
qualitatively different from other age-period-cohort (APC) models in
that it characterizes cohort effects as a structure of the age-by-period
interaction terms to acknowledge the interdependence of age, period, and
cohort effects, whereas prior methods attempt to recover the independent
and additive effects of the three variables. The APC-I model has been
used to understand the unique contribution of cohort membership in
various outcomes including crime involvement, substance use, and
cultural taste
[@lu_cohort_2020; @verdery_visualizing_2020; @ma_what_2020]. However,
the authors of the APC-I model focused on the conceptual motivation of
the method and offered relatively few technical details for implementing
the method. Estimating and testing cohort effects in the APC-I model may
be be challenging for interested readers.

We developed an R package
[APCI](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=APCI) [@apci] and a Stata
command apci for implementing the APC-I model in empirical research
using pooled cross-sectional data (e.g., the General Social Survey and
the Current Population Survey) and importantly, extend the APC-I method
for analyzing multi-cohort longitudinal or panel data (e.g., data from
the Health and Retirement Study
([HRS](#https://hrs.isr.umich.edu/about)) and the National Longitudinal
Study of Youth ([NLSY](#https://www.bls.gov/nls/))). The purpose of this
paper is three folded. First, we describe the R functions in the
[APCI](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=APCI) package and Stata
command to estimate and test age, period, and cohort effects in the
APC-I model. The core function can be used for analyzing pooled
cross-sectional data and multi-cohort longitudinal data. Second, we
introduce a set of visualization tools to help researchers motivate an
APC analysis and interpret age, period, and cohort effects from the
APC-I model. Third, we clarify several important issues about
characterizing cohort effects as a set of age-by-period interaction
terms. We pay particular attention to the implications of coding schemes
and how to interpret the between-cohort average deviations and
within-cohort life-course variations.

This paper is organized as follows. Following a description of
traditional APC models and the identification problem, we introduce the
APC-I model and the estimation and testing procedures. We explain how
and why the age-by-period interaction terms can be used to characterize
cohort effects with particular attention to the implications of coding
schemes for estimating and testing interactions. Next, we describe the
visualization tools and functions in the R package
[APCI](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=APCI). We then demonstrate how
to use the package with the empirical example of men's and women's labor
force participation from 1990 to 2018 in the United States using data
from the Current Population Survey
[[CPS,](#https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/cps/data.html)
@cps_citation].

# Methodology: the APC-I model {#methodology}

## The APC identification problem {#identification}

To formally estimate and infer the independent age, period, and cohort
effects, @mason_methodological_1973 specified an analysis of variance
(ANOVA) model that they labeled the age-period-cohort (APC) accounting
model:

$$\label{eq:1}
g\left(E\left(Y_{i j}\right)\right)=\mu+\alpha_{i}+\beta_{j}+\gamma_{k}$$
for age groups $i=1, 2,\ldots, A$, periods $j=1, 2,\ldots, P$, and
cohorts $k=1, 2,\ldots, (A+P-1)$, where
$\sum_{i=1}^{A} \alpha_{i}=\sum_{j=1}^{P}\beta_{j}=\sum_{k=1}^{A+P-1} \gamma_{k}=0$.
$E\left(Y_{i j}\right)$denotes the expected value of the outcome $Y$ for
the $i$th age group in the $j$th time period; $g$ is the "link
function"; $\alpha_i$ denotes the mean difference from the global mean
$\mu$ associated with the $i$th age category; $\beta_j$ denotes the mean
difference from $\mu$ associated with the $j$th period; $\gamma_k$
denotes the mean difference from $\mu$ associated with membership in the
$k$th cohort.

Unfortunately, the APC accounting model
([\[eq:1\]](#eq:1){reference-type="ref" reference="eq:1"}) is not
identified even when a coding scheme (e.g., dummy coding where one group
is set as the reference group or effect coding where the sum of the
coefficients for each effect is set to 0) is applied. This is because
age, period, and cohort are exactly linearly related [see
@fienberg_identification_1979; @fosse_analyzing_2019; @luo_sensitivity_2016
for detailed discussions]. As a result, the design matrix of model
([\[eq:1\]](#eq:1){reference-type="ref" reference="eq:1"}) has rank one
less than full, so an infinite number of solutions (i.e., estimates) for
the parameters fit the data equally well. That is, the data cannot
distinguish different estimation results, so an additional constraint
--- in addition to the usual reference group or sum-to-zero constraint
--- must be imposed in order to choose one set of estimates. Moreover,
interpreting the results is difficult because the standard
interpretation of regression coefficients --- that is, the conditional
effect of one variable after accounting for other covariates --- cannot
apply due to the lack of variation in the third variable (e.g., cohort)
after considering the other two (e.g., age and period).

The theoretical root of the identification problem in traditional APC
models is the problematic assumption that age, period, and cohort
effects operate independently of each other. It implies that the
identification challenge is inherent in any APC model that attempts to
separate independent and additive effects of age, period, and cohort and
thus cannot be solved by changing the model setup [e.g., using random
effects for period and cohort as in [@yang_mixed_2006]; see
@luo_constraints_2020 for a critique] or by variable manipulation [e.g.,
using unequal interval widths for age, period, and cohort groups as in
[@robertson_age_1986; @sarma_canadian_2012]; see @luo_sensitivity_2016
for a detailed discussion]. The identification problem is well
recognized, and its consequences have been discussed extensively
[@fienberg_specification_1985; @fosse_analyzing_2019; @kupper_age-period-cohort_1983; @kupper_statistical_1985; @luo_sensitivity_2016; @luo_constraints_2020; @te_grotenhuis_intrinsic_2016; @obrienEstimableIntraageIntraperiod2020; @morgan2021rolling; @luo2013paradigm].
In essence, internal information derived from the data cannot help
because the problem is circular: researchers do the analysis to learn
precisely the kind of information needed to justify any such constraint.

## The APC-I model {#model}

@luo_age-period-cohort-interaction_2020 proposed a new APC model called
the age-period-cohort-interaction (APC-I) model. The APC-I model is
qualitatively different from all estimators developed under the
traditional framework in that it explicitly specifies cohort effects as
a structure of the age-by-period interactions. A life-course dynamics
hypothesis that concerns about whether and how cohort effects may change
as cohorts age thus corresponds to a specific structure of the
age-by-period interactions. This specification is motivated by the
theoretical account that "The minimal basis for expecting
interdependence between inter-cohort differentiation and social change
is that change has variant import for persons of unlike age"
[@ryder_cohort_1965]. That is, a basic notion on which cohort analysis
rests is that "transformations of the social world modify people of
different ages in different ways." [@ryder_cohort_1965]

The APC-I model is fully identified in the sense that it does not
require additional constraints other than a regular coding scheme. It is
also flexible enough to test various hypotheses about life-course
changes within cohorts as cohort members age. We first describe the
model specification and estimation and testing techniques. The next
section demonstrates the procedure using empirical examples.

The general form of the APC-I model can be written as: $$\label{eq:2}
g\left(E\left(Y_{i j}\right)\right)=\mu+\alpha_{i}+\beta_{j}+\alpha \beta_{i j(k)}$$
where $g$, $Y_{ij}$, $\mu$, $\alpha_{i}$ and $\beta_{j}$ are defined as
in model ([\[eq:1\]](#eq:1){reference-type="ref" reference="eq:1"}) and
$\alpha \beta_{i j(k)}$ denotes the interaction of the $i$th age group
and $j$th period group, corresponding to the effect of the $k$th cohort.
Note that except for the oldest and youngest cohorts, the effect of one
cohort includes multiple age-by-period interaction terms
$\alpha \beta_{i j(k)}$ that lie on the same diagonal in a table with
ages in rows and periods in columns.

Model ([\[eq:2\]](#eq:2){reference-type="ref" reference="eq:2"}) differs
from model ([\[eq:1\]](#eq:1){reference-type="ref" reference="eq:1"}) in
the way that cohort effects are modeled. In model
([\[eq:2\]](#eq:2){reference-type="ref" reference="eq:2"}), cohort
effects are considered as a specific form of the age-by-period
interaction. In statistics, the interaction between two variables
describes the differential effects of one variable depending on the
level of the other [@scheffe_analysis_1999]. In APC research, this means
that if part of the overall pattern of interest can be attributed to
cohort differences, significant age-by-period interactions should be
present. When cohort membership is not associated with the outcome ---
that is, when the effects of historical or social shifts (period
effects) are uniform across age groups --- then age-by-period
interactions should not be present.

@luo_age-period-cohort-interaction_2020 described a procedure for
investigating age and period main effects and inter-cohort deviations
and intra-cohort dynamics. They recommended beginning with a deviance
test about whether the effects of time periods vary among age groups,
which is called "a global F test". A non-significant global F statistic
indicates that there are few age-by-period interaction effects and thus
little cohort variation. If the model suggests significant age-by-period
interaction effects, one may proceed to examine inter- and intra-cohort
differences[^1]. Inter-cohort average deviations are quantified based on
the arithmetic mean of the age-by-period interaction terms contained in
each cohort and a t test can be used to examine the average of that
cohort-specific deviation. To investigate intra-cohort dynamics over the
life course [e.g., the cumulative (dis)advantage hypothesis in
@dannefer_aging_1987; @ferraro_what_2018; @chauvelTestingPersistenceCohort2016; @obrienEstimableIntraageIntraperiod2020],
one may use a t-test of the linear orthogonal polynomial contrast in
each cohort's age-by-period interaction effects. This intra-cohort
life-course dynamics test is helpful for investigating whether the
average (dis)advantages of the members of that cohort accumulate, remain
stable, or diminish as they age.

The APC-I model has three advantages. First, it is identified in that it
does not require additional constraints other than the usual coding
scheme. That is, it avoids the identification problem of the APC
accounting model based on the theoretical account of cohort effects and
allows inclusion of other important predictors such as education, sex,
and employment status. Second, the interpretation of the coefficient
estimates of the APC-I model is meaningful and straightforward. This is
because the APC-I model recognizes the dependence of age, period, and
cohort so the dilemma that analysts face using traditional APC models
does not apply. Third, the APC-I model permits investigating life-course
dynamics as a cohort ages, whereas extant methods usually assume that
cohort effects do not change.

It is important to note that the APC-I model is never intended to
\"solve\" the identification problem in traditional APC accounting
models because it is a false problem to begin with. Given the near
monopoly of the accounting model, it may be challenging not to see the
APC-I method through the lens of the traditional APC accounting
framework. For example, because the APC-I model quantifies cohort
effects as a structure of the age-by-period interactions, some readers
may take it to mean that the APC-I model cannot estimate \"linear cohort
main effects\". However, the APC-I method, by design, does not intend to
estimate any kind of \"linear cohort main effects\" precisely because
the traditional model's assumption that there is a linear cohort effect
that is additive or independent of age and period effects lacks
theoretical grounding and is thus arbitrary and questionable. Please see
@luo_age-period-cohort-interaction_2020 for a more thorough discussion
about the theoretical motivation of the APC-I model.

Because the APC-I mode is relatively new, below we make additional
remarks about interaction effects and coding schemes to help readers
better understand and use the model.

## Interaction effects {#interaction}

In some cases, interaction terms may be difficult to interpret besides
suggesting that the effect of one variable may depend on the values of
the other. However, as explained by
@luo_age-period-cohort-interaction_2020, the age-by-period interaction
terms correspond to the conceptual definition of cohort effects and thus
can be modeled and interpreted in a meaningful way. Specifically, cohort
effects are expected when the influence of social events and changes
differ by age groups. This conceptualization of cohort effects implies
that the age-by-period interactions, which represent the differential
effects of time periods depending on age, can be used to measure cohort
effects.

Technically, because of the linear dependency among age, period, and
cohort, the effects of the third variable can be expressed as the
interaction between the other two variables. The APC-I model considers
age and period as main effects and cohort their interactions, which may
give the impression that it privileges age and period effects and
"discriminates" against cohort effects. The theoretical motivation for
this choice is that it is often desirable to estimate a general age
pattern that individuals follow as they get older. Period main effects
are used to represent the kind of impacts of social environment that
everyone in the society is exposed to. The decision to quantify cohort
effects as a specific form of age-by-period interaction is informed by
the demographic literature on how cohort effects are conceptualized in
relation to age and period effects. Empirically, as the analysis of
women's labor force participation in section [Examples](#example) will
illustrate, the size of the cohort effects, characterized as the
age-by-period interactions, is not necessarily smaller---in fact may be
larger---than some of the main effects.

## Coding scheme and contrast {#contrasts}

For the unidentified APC accounting model, some estimation methods
including the intrinsic estimator yield effect estimates that are
dependent on the choice of coding schemes in that estimates under
different coding schemes are not equivalent [see
@luo_sensitivity_2016; @te_grotenhuis_intrinsic_2016 for a more detailed
discussion]. The APC-I model does not have a rank deficiency problem in
the sense that it does not require more constraints than a usual ANOVA
model with main effects and their interactions. For any identified model
including the APC-I model, the estimates are equivalent; that is, the
estimated cell means are the same for all coding schemes.

Although this equivalence holds for both main effects and interaction
estimates in the APC-I model, it is less obvious for interaction terms
because the interpretation of the specific parameter estimates do change
with coding schemes. To illustrate, consider an example of applying the
APC-I model to health data with three age categories and three periods,
shown in [table 1](#table:1) below. Under dummy coding---for example,
the youngest age group 20-24 and the beginning survey period of 2000 are
set to zero or omitted as the referent---the interaction for ages 25-29
and period 2005 in cell Y represents the difference in a health outcome
between periods 2000 and 2005 for age 25-29 or equivalently, health
difference between ages 25-29 and 20-24 for the period 2005. That is,
interactions under dummy coding represents a directional difference from
a particular reference group.

::: center
$$\begin{array}{|c|c|c|c|c|}
\hline & & \multicolumn{3}{|c|} {\text { Period }}  \\
\hline & & 2000 & 2005 & 2010 \\
\hline \text { Age } & 20-24 & & & \\
\cline { 2 - 5 } & 25-29 & & \mathrm{Y} & \\
\cline { 2 - 5 } & 30-34 & & & \\
\hline
\end{array}$$ []{#table:1 label="table:1"}
:::

By contrast, under effect coding (i.e., sum-to-zero coding), the same
interaction term in cell $Y$ represents the deviation in the health
outcome from the age main effect plus period main effect for the group
of individuals who were age 25-29 and surveyed in period 2005.

The estimated interaction terms under these two types of coding in cell
$Y$ thus necessarily have different numerical values. However, this
difference does not arise from an identification problem but rather from
a shift in what these quantities represent. That is, the two interaction
terms can be transformed to be equivalent so that the means in $Y$ after
considering age and period main effects are the same under the two
coding schemes.

We recommend using effect or sum-to-zero coding for estimating the APC-I
model for the following reasons: when characterizing cohort effects as a
set of age-by-period interactions, we are less concerned about any
direction of the interactions; that is, we are not particularly
interested in the difference between two cohorts at a particular age or
time period. Rather, we focus on particular structures of these
interactions that may represent theoretically interesting patterns
during a cohort's life span. Effect coding is helpful because they all
have the same referent group --- the next lower level in the hierarchy
of main effects and interactions. That is, we choose effect coding for
the purpose of easy interpretation. This is also consistent with the
recommendation of coding schemes in the presence of interactions
[@aiken_multiple_1991; @jaccard_interaction_2003].

# The R package APCI {#pacakge}

## Package installation {#install}

The R package [APCI](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=APCI) [^2] can
be installed and loaded using the following R code[^3]:

::: example
\# install R package APCI \> install.packages(\"APCI\") \# load R
package APCI to the current working environment \> library(APCI)
:::

The main routines to implement the APC-I model using package
[APCI](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=APCI) are apci.plot.raw, apci,
apci.plot (or apci.plot.hexagram, apci.plot.heatmap). A summary of these
functions and input arguments used in the routines are described below.

## Functions in R package APCI {#functions}

The R package [APCI](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=APCI) contains
the following functions for estimating the APC-I model and visualizing
the data and the model results:

-    apci: to estimate the age, period, and cohort effects using the
    APC-I model.

-    temp_model: an internal function that estimates a generalized
    linear model.

-    tests: to conduct the global F test.

-    maineffect: an internal function to extract age and period main
    effects.

-    cohortdeviation: an internal function to extract between-cohort
    average deviations and within-cohort life-course dynamics.

-    ageperiod_group: to return a cohort index based on how age and
    period are grouped.

-    apci.plot.raw: to visualize the mean values of the outcome across
    age and period groups, respectively.

-    apci.plot.hexagram: to visualize the estimated cohort effects in a
    hexagram style.

-    apci.plot.heatmap: to visualize the estimated cohort effects in a
    heatmap style.

-    apci.plot: to visualize the estimated age, period, and cohorts in
    conventional figures.

A summary of input arguments required in these functions will be given
one by one [^4] in the next section. Package
[APCI](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=APCI) also contains three
empirical datasets *women9017*, *cpsmen*, *cpswomen*, and one simulated
dataset *simulation*. Dataset *women9017* was used and described in
@luo_age-period-cohort-interaction_2020. Applications of the APC-I model
to the other two empirical datasets are given in section
[Examples](#example).

### Function apci {#fun:apci}

Function apci is the core function in the R package
[APCI](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=APCI). It fits an APC-I model
with or without covariates and returns a list of results including
coefficients and standard error estimates for age main effects, period
main effects, inter-cohort average deviations, and intra-cohort
life-course trends, and covariate coefficients if any. Both pooled
cross-sectional data and multi-cohort longitudinal/panel data are
supported. Specifically, function apci is used as

::: example
apci(data, outcome, age, period, cohort, weight, covariate, family,
dev.test=TRUE, print, gee, id, corstr,\...)
:::

and takes the following arguments:

-    data: a data frame containing an outcome variable, age group
    indicators, period group indicators, and covariates to be used in
    the model. If a variable is not found in data, there will be an
    error message reminding users to check the input data again.
    Supported data structures include pooled cross-sectional data and
    multi-cohort longitudinal/panel data.

-    outcome: an object of class character containing the name of the
    outcome variable. The outcome variable can be a continuous,
    categorical, or count variable.

-    age: an object of class character indicating the age group index
    taking on the number of distinct values in the data (e.g., six age
    groups: 20-24, 25-29, 30-34, 35-39, 40-44, and 45-49). The vector
    should be a factor (or "category", or "enumerated type").

-    period: an object of class character indicating the time period
    index in the data.

-    cohort: an optional object of class character indicating cohort
    membership index in the data. The cohort index can be generated from
    the age group index and time period index in the data because of the
    exact linear relationship among these three time-related indices.

-    weight: an optional vector of sample weights to be used in the
    model fitting process. If non-NULL, user-supplied weights will be
    used in the first step to estimate the model. Observations with
    negative weights will be dropped in modeling.

-    covariates: an optional vector of characters containing the names
    of user-specified covariate(s) to be used in the model. If the
    variables are not found in data, there will be an error message
    reminding the users to check the data again.

-    dev.test: logical, specifying if the global F test (step 1) should
    be implemented before fitting the APC-I model. If TRUE, apci will
    first run the global F test and report the test results; otherwise,
    apci will skip this step and return NULL. The default setting is
    TRUE. However, users should be aware that the algorithm will not
    automatically stop even if there is no significant age-by-period
    interactions based on the global F test.[^5]

-    family: a character string specifying the link function to be used
    in the model. The value can be "binomial", "multinomial", or
    "gaussian". See R function glm for more details about link
    functions.

-    print: logical, specifying if the intermediate results should be
    displayed in the console when fitting the model. The default setting
    is TRUE to display the results of each procedure.

-    gee: logical, indicating if the data is cross-sectional data or
    longitudinal/panel data. If TRUE, the generalized estimating
    equation will be used to correct the standard error estimates. The
    default is FALSE, indicating that the data are cross-sectional.

-    id: a character vector specifying the cluster index in longitudinal
    data. It is required when gee is TRUE. The length of the vector
    should be the same as the number of observations.

-    corstr: a character string specifying a possible correlation
    structure in the error terms when gee is TRUE. The following are
    allowed: independence, fixed, stat_M\_dep, non_stat_M\_dep,
    exchangeable, AR-M and unstructured. The default value is
    exchangeable.

-    unequal_interval: logical, indicating if age and period groups are
    of the same interval width. The default is set as TRUE.

-    age_range, period_range: numeric vectors indicating the actual age
    or period range (e.g., 10 to 59 years old or from 2000 to 2019).

-    age_interval, period_interval, age_group, period_group: numeric
    values or character vectors indicating how age and period are
    grouped. age_interval and period_interval indicate the width of age
    and period intervals, respectively. age_group and period_group are
    character vectors listing possible age and period groups. There are
    two ways to define age and period groups with unequal intervals: 1)
    defining age_interval and period_interval, or 2) defining age_group
    and period_group. Users must define age and period groups using one
    of the two options when unequal_interval is TRUE.

-    \...: further optional arguments to be passed to the model.

As mentioned in section [Coding scheme and contrast](#contrasts), we use
effect coding to estimate the APC-I model. The age and period arguments
in function apci accept categorical variables. Different from the common
approach of dummy coding or simple coding, where an effect is defined as
the difference of each group from the reference group, function apci
uses effect coding (i.e., the sum-to-zero coding, deviation coding, or
the ANOVA coding) as the default coding. Under this coding scheme, the
effect of the omitted category equals the negative sum of the effects of
all other categories. Computation wise, the effect coefficient of the
omitted category is redundant because of the coding scheme. However, for
the purpose of quantifying cohort effects as deviations from the main
effects of age and period, it is useful to compute estimates for all
age-by-period cross-classifications and their standard errors. For data
with *A* age groups and *P* periods, therefore, function apci returns
$A$ and $P$ number of main effect estimates and $A*P$ number of
interaction estimates along with their standard error estimates. For the
main effects of age or period, the estimate can be interpreted as the
deviation associated with each age or period group from the global mean.
The age-by-period interactions represent the deviation from the
expectation determined by the corresponding age and period main effects.

Also note that when age and period groups have unequal interval widths
in an age-period classification table, the age-by-period interactions
contained in a cohort no longer lie on the same diagonals. Because
cohort effects are conceptualized and estimated as a structure of the
age-by-period interactions in the APC-I model, it is technically
possible to use the argument unequal_interval in package
[APCI](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=APCI) to extract interaction
coefficient estimates that lie on different diagonals. However, unequal
age and period group intervals may complicate the issue of cohort
overlapping noted by @kupper_statistical_1985. For this reason, we do
not recommend using unequal interval widths for age and period groups if
possible.

After fitting the APC-I model, function apci will store the following
components as a list for further usage:

-    model: a summary of the fitted generalized linear regression
    model.[^6] It displays the standard regression output including
    coefficient and standard errors estimates.

-    dev_global: the global F test results. It examines if the
    interaction terms are significant in a generalized linear regression
    model that contains age and period main effects and their
    interactions.

-    intercept: the overall intercept ($\mu$ in equation
    [\[eq:2\]](#eq:2){reference-type="ref" reference="eq:2"}).

-    age_effect: a vector containing the estimated effect for each age
    group.

-    period_effect: a vector containing the estimated effect for each
    time period.

-    cohort_average: a vector containing the inter-cohort average
    deviations for comparing differences between cohorts.

-    cohort_slope: a vector containing intra-cohort life-course trends.

### Function tests {#fun:tests}

As mentioned earlier, the first step of implementing the APC-I model is
to conduct a global F test of the age-by-period interactions. This step
is a routine in function apci, but the procedure does not stop even if
there is no statistically significant deviation from the age main effect
and period main effect. Therefore, we recommend separately conducting
the global F test. In R package
[APCI](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=APCI), the function tests can
be used for this purpose. It can be used as follows:

::: example
tests(model, A, P, C, \...)
:::

and takes the following arguments:

-    model: a generalized linear regression model generated from the
    internal function temp_model. [^7]

-    A, P, C: numbers of age groups, period groups, or cohort groups. If
    age and period groups are of different widths, the values of will be
    automatically generated by the function.

Function tests will return a standard F test result including the value
of the F test statistic and the associated p-value.

### Functions for visualization {#fun:vis}

In package [APCI](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=APCI), we provide
four functions to facilitate visualizing the data and model results,
namely apci.plot.raw, apci.heatmap, apci.plot.hexagram, and apci.plot,
in different stages of a research project. They take similar input
arguments. A summary of these arguments is given below.

Function apci.plot.raw is designed to plot the outcome variable
aggregated by age or period groups. This function may be used in the
stage of data exploration. Functions apci.heatmap and apci.plot.hexagram
are designed to plot the age-by-period interactions from the APC-I
model. Both functions generate heatmaps, where one axis represents age
groups, and the other period groups. The cells in a diagonal represent
one cohort. The difference between the two functions is the layout of
the heatmap; one is a rectangular graph and the other a hexagram.
Function apci.plot can be used to visualize both raw data and model
results. It divides the canvas into four ($2 \times 2$) panels. Three of
the four panels can be used to visualize the three effect estimates in
the APC-I model and the left panel to add notes. For data exploration,
users can visualize the mean values of the outcome variable across age,
period, and cohort groups on the same canvas. Users can the same
functions to visualize the estimated age, period, and cohort effects
from the modeling results.

The visualization functions in package
[APCI](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=APCI) include:

::: example
apci.plot.raw(data, outcome_var, age, period, \...)

apci.plot.heatmap(model, age, period, color_map = NULL, color_scale =
NULL, quantile = NULL, \...)

apci.plot.hexagram(model, age, period, first_age, first_period,
interval, color_scale = NULL, color_map = NULL, quantile = NULL, ...)

apci.plot(model, age, period, outcome_var, type = \"model\", quantile =
NULL, \...)
:::

and takes the following arguments:

-    model: a list recording the results from function apci.

-    outcome_var: an object of class character indicating the name of
    the outcome variable used in the model. The outcome variable can be
    a continuous, binary, categorical, or count variable.

-    age: a vector indicating the age group. The vector should be
    converted to a factor (or the terms of "category" and "enumerated
    type").

-    period: a vector indicating the time period. The vector should be
    converted to a factor (or "category", "enumerated type").

-    color_map: a vector representing a color palette to be used in the
    figure. The default setting is greys if color_map is NULL.
    Alternatives, for example, can be c("blue", "yellow"), "blues", etc.

-    cohort_scale: a vector containing two values to indicate the
    minimum and maximum values, respectively, of the estimated cohort
    effects to be displayed. If NULL, the function will use the range
    from the estimation results.

-    quantile: a number valued between 0 and 1, representing the
    desirable percentiles to be used in visualizing the data or model.
    If NULL, the original scale of the outcome variable will be used.

# Examples: Application of the R package APCI to empirical data {#example}

We now illustrate how to use package
[APCI](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=APCI)'s visualization and
analytical functions. We describe and analyze two empirical datasets to
demonstrate how this package may be used to analyze pooled
cross-sectional data. We later briefly describe how to fit an APC-I
model for multi-cohort longitudinal data.

## Cross-sectional data of labor force participation in the United States {#example1}

Temporal trends in men's and women's labor force participation (LFP) in
United States have gathered much scholarly attention [see e.g.
@connellyEffectChildCare1992; @farkas1977cohort; @hollisterUnmaskingConflictingTrends2014; @macunovichRelativeCohortSize2012; @treasEffectWomenLabor1987; @wilkieDeclineMenLabor1991a].
For example, whereas men's LFP steadily declined in the past decades
[@wilkieDeclineMenLabor1991a], women's LFP continued to rise until the
1990s and the 2000s. Female LFP has since then reached a plateau and
even begun to decline. Researchers have debated about the causes of this
leveling off or decline. Some studies attributed the observed trends to
period-specific factors such as labor demand
[@ercegLaborForceParticipation2014], the economic shocks of the Great
Recession [@bousheyAreWomenOpting; @hoffman2009changing], social welfare
and disability insurance [@duggan200911], and gender role attitudes
[@fortinGenderRoleAttitudes2015].

However, the temporal trends in LFP are unlikely due to a pure period
process. For example, because individuals may begin to leave the labor
force in age 50, a decline in LFP should be expected if the proportion
of the population age 50 or older has increased. That is, the recent
trends may reflect a change in the age composition of the US population
[@aaronsonLaborForceParticipation2014]. The cohort succession may also
contribute to the trend, a process in which older cohorts with higher or
lower LFP rates begin to decease and younger cohorts with lower or
higher LFP enter the labor force @lee_plateau_2014. At the same time,
critical social and demographic changes in education level, fertility,
and attitudes about women working outside the home may be more of
cohort-specific than period-specific processes because these forces only
affect individuals of certain ages
[@balleerLabourForceParticipation2014; @farreIntergenerationalTransmissionGender2013; @fernandezCulturalChangeLearning2013; @goldin_quiet_2006].

Given that the observed trends in LFP are likely a mix of age, period,
and/or cohort patterns, an APC analysis that decomposes the temporal
trends into age-, period-, and cohort-related variations is thus helpful
for revealing the demographic, social, and economic changes that have
underlined the temporal trends in American's labor force participation.
In this following section, we demonstrate how to use the functions in
[APCI](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=APCI) to undertake an APC
analysis of men's and women's LFP using a cross-sectional dataset.

The Current Population Survey
[[CPS,](#https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/cps/data.html)
@cps_citation] is the primary source of labor force statistics in the
United States [@cps_citation]. Beginning in the 1960s, the CPS has been
collecting data on key demographic, economic, and education topics. We
subset the 1990-2019 CPS data by gender, resulting in two datasets,
namely *cpsmen* and *cpswomen*, to show how to conduct an APC-I analysis
of men's and women's LFP in the United States using package
[APCI](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=APCI).

Datasets *cpsmen* and *cpswomen* contain a subset of men and women age
20-64 who participated in the 1990 to 2019 CPS. The following code is
used to load the data into the working environment:

::: example
\> data(cpsmen) \> data(cpswomen)
:::

The first five rows of the datasets of *cpsmen* and *cpswomen* are:

::: example
\> head(cpsmen, n = 5) asecwt year age labforce educc 2854.84 3 5 0 1
1576.54 4 4 1 2 2340.55 2 6 1 3 158.44 3 5 0 0 347.09 6 6 1 3

\> head(cpswomen, n = 5) asecwt year age labforce educc 2415.67 2 3 1 1
663.89 2 5 1 3 1653.01 6 4 1 2 1613.31 6 4 0 2 177.23 4 3 1 2
:::

where labforce indicates the respondent's labor force participation
status (1=in the labor force, 0=not in the labor force). asecwt is the
person-level weight that the CPS recommends to be used in
individual-level data analyses. year indicates the survey year when
respondent was interviewed, grouped into 6 period groups (1=1990-94,
2=1995-99, ..., 6=2015-19). age indicates the respondent's age
categories (1=20-24, 2=25-29, ..., 9=60-64). educc is a three-level
categorical education measure (1=less than high school, 2=high school
graduate, 3=college degree or above).

For data exploratory purpose, function apci.plot.raw visualizes the
outcome variable in the following way:

::: example
\> apci.plot.raw(data, outcome_var, age, period)
:::

![Period-specific age trajectories and age-specific period trends in
labor force participation rates for men and women in the United States,
the Current Population Survey 1990-2019. Age trajectories are similar
across time periods for both men and women (top panel). Period trends
differ by age groups, especially among women (bottom
panel).](figure1.pdf){#figure:1 width="1\\linewidth"}

[Figure 1](#figure:1) shows LFP rates by age groups (top panel) and
period groups (bottom panel), respectively, for male (left panel) and
female CPS respondents (right panel) age 20 to 64 from 1990 to 2019.
Figure 1's top panel suggests similar age patterns in LFP across time
periods. The bottom panel shows distinct period trends depending on age
groups. For example, the LFP rates among women in the 55-59 and 60-64
age groups seem to have gone up whereas other age groups show a
relatively flat trend. Such distinct period patterns in LFP by age
groups suggest potential cohort variations in women's labor force
participation. For men's LFP, however, the visualization results suggest
that a simpler model with age and period main effects may suffice for
summarizing their LFP patterns.

Function apci can be used to fit an APC-I model for pooled
cross-sectional data or multi-cohort longitudinal/panel data. In the
simplest form of an APC-I model without covariates for pooled
cross-sectional data, function apci is called as follows:

::: example
\> no_cov \<- APCI::apci(outcome = \"labforce\", + age = \"age\", +
period = \"year\", + weight = \"asecwt\", + data = cpswomen, + dev.test
= FALSE, + family = \"binomial\")
:::

It is often desirable to add covariates in the model, which can be done
by calling the covariate argument. For example, suppose one would like
to add education levels ("educc") as a covariate in the model, function
apci can be used as:

::: example
\> with_cov \<- APCI::apci(outcome = \"labforce\", + age = \"age\", +
period = \"year\", + covariate = c(\"educc\"), + weight = \"asecwt\", +
data = cpswomen, + print=F, + dev.test=FALSE, + family = \"binomial\")
:::

Below is a summary of the results from an APC-I model that includes
education levels as a covariate:

::: example
\> summary(with_cov) Length Class Mode model 33 svyglm list dev_global 0
-none- NULL intercept 4 -none- character age_effect 45 -none- character
period_effect 30 -none- character cohort_average 6 data.frame list
cohort_slope 6 data.frame list int_matrix 5 data.frame list cohort_index
54 -none- numeric data 7 data.frame list
:::

The returned value is a list of objects. model contains the results from
a logistic regression model with age and period main effects and the
unstructured interactions. dev_global displays the global F test result.
A significant F statistic suggests that there may exist cohort effects.
intercept is the overall intercept ($\mu$ in Equation
[\[eq:2\]](#eq:2){reference-type="ref" reference="eq:2"}). age_effect
gives estimated age main effect. period_effect is the estimated period
main effect. cohort_average gives inter-cohort average deviations from
age and period main effects. cohort_slope gives intra-cohort life-course
linear slopes, which can be used for testing intra-cohort life-course
dynamics. int_matrix displays a matrix that contains the estimated
coefficients for age-by-period interactions. Note that there are A\*P
interactions in int_matrix because effect coding is used to compute the
A+P-1 interaction estimates based on the (A-1)\*(P-1) freely varying
interaction parameters. Such interaction estimates are used to generate
heatmaps similar to Figure 2. data stores the data fed into apci
function. Users may call an object to obtain detailed results. For
example, by calling with_cov\$cohort_average and with_cov\$cohort_slope,
users can obtain estimated inter-cohort average deviations and
intra-cohort life-course slopes.

The output below shows education-adjusted inter-cohort average
deviations in women's LFP from analyzing the *cpswomen* data using
function apci.

where c_slp_group indicates cohort membership (e.g., cohort 1=the 1930
birth cohort, cohort 2=the 1935 birth cohort,\..., cohort 14=the 1995
birth cohort), c_slp_est is intra-cohort life-course slopes, c_slp_se is
the standard error estimate for the life-course slope, c_slp_t is the t

the p values and alpha levels (\*: p \< .05, \*\*: p \< .01, and \*\*\*:
p \< .001), respectively. NAs are generated for the youngest and oldest
cohort because there is only one age-by-period combination observed for
the two cohorts and thus intra-cohort life-course dynamics cannot be
accessed.

For example, for cohort 12 (the 1985 birth cohort), the estimated
intra-cohort slope is 0.353 (p \< .05), meaning that this cohort's LFP
is lower than expected when they were young but higher than expected in
older ages. Interestingly, for cohort 12 (the 1985 birth cohort), their
average cohort deviation is not statistically significant. Such an
insignificant inter-cohort average deviation and a significantly
negative intra-cohort slope indicate a compensation life-course pattern;
that is, this cohort's lower-than-expected LFP in younger ages seems to
be compensated by their higher LFP when they were older.

The intra-cohort life-course dynamics are based on the age-by-period
interactions as follows:

where "iaesti" is the age-by-period interaction estimates, "iase" is the
standard error estimate for the interaction term, "iap" and "iasig" are
the p value and alpha level (\*: p \< .05, \*\*: p \< .01, and \*\*\*: p
\< .001),respectively, and "cohortindex" indicates cohort membership.

The following code can be used to organize the intra-cohort life-course
estimates in a matrix form:

Based on the R package
[ggplot2](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=ggplot2) [@ggplot2],
heatmaps can be generated to visualize inter- and intra-cohort patterns
and motivate a subsequent formal APC analysis. For example, for dataset
*whitemen*, both inter-cohort average deviations and intra-cohort
life-course dynamics may be visualized in a heatmap as follows:

::: example
\> apci.plot.heatmap(model = with_cov, age = \"age\",period = 'year',

higher-than-expected rates. Each diagonal that runs from the lower left

[Figure 2](#figure:2) is a heatmap of the estimated age-by-period
interactions, with rows defined by age groups and columns by time
periods. Each square represents an age-by-period interaction. Yellow
squares indicate lower participation rates than the expectation
determined by the age and period main effects. Blue squares indicate
higher-than-expected rates. Each diagonal that runs from the lower left
to the upper right represents one birth cohort. The dotted line in
Figure 2 indicates a significant inter-cohort average deviation but an
insignificant intra-cohort slope in their LFP for the 1955 cohort.
Cohorts that on average significantly deviate from the expected rates
based on age and period main effects are indicated by solid, dashed, or
dotted lines. Solid lines indicate significantly (p\<.05) positive
intra-cohort life-course slopes, dashed lines significantly negative
intra-cohort slopes, and dotted lines significant average inter-cohort
deviations but insignificant intra-cohort slopes. Users have the options
to customize the elements of these figures to suit their research or
teaching purposes.

Figure 2 indicates that although some cohorts had LFP rates that differ
from the expected rates based on age and period main effects, only the
1955 birth cohort (marked by a dotted line) had, on average,
higher-than-expected LFP rates (inter-cohort average deviation = .174, p
\< .05), and this higher LFP seems to persist over their life course
(intra-cohort slope = .007, p = .969). This visualization results are
consistent with the results from with_cov\$cohort_average and
with_cov\$cohort_slope.

Users can also use bar plots to visualize inter-cohort average
deviations. Function apci.bar can be used as:

::: example
\> apci.bar(model = with_cov, age = \"age\",period = \"year\",
cohort_label = seq(1930,1995,5))
:::

![Bar plots showing inter-cohort average deviations in women's labor

observed. The bars indicate the estimated average deviation for each
cohort from the age and period main effects. Bars above the horizontal
line indicate positive average deviations, and bars below the line
indicate negative average deviations. The asterisk sign indicates that a
cohort's average deviation is significantly different from the
expectation determined by age and period main effects at the .05 or
lower level.](figure3.pdf){#figure:3 width="0.8\\linewidth"}

[Figure 3](#figure:3) illustrates inter-cohort deviations based on the
average of the age-by-period interaction estimates contained in each
cohort. The horizontal line at y=0 indicates expectations for all cohort
based on the main effects of age and period when they are observed. The
bars indicate the estimated average deviation for each cohort from the
age and period main effects. Bars above the horizontal line indicate
positive average deviations, and bars below the line indicate negative
average deviations. The asterisk sign indicates that a cohort's average
deviation is significantly different from the expectation determined by
age and period main effects. Figure 3 suggests some cohort variation in
women's LFP using the 1990-2019 CPS data, but only the 1955 birth cohort
had significantly higher-than-expected LFP rates.

### Longitudinal data {#example2:gee}

For longitudinal data (i.e., panel data, repeated measure data) that
include multiple cohorts, users may set the argument gee to TRUE to
estimate an APC-I model using the generalized estimating equation (GEE)
technique [@liang1986longitudinal; @geerpackage]. When gee is TRUE,
users will also need to specify arguments id and corstr accordingly.

::: example
\> model_gee \<- apci(outcome = \"y\", + age = \"age\", + period =
\"period\", + cohort = NULL, + weight = NULL, + covariate = NULL, +
data=simulation_gee, + family =\"gaussian\", + dev.test = FALSE, + print
= TRUE, + gee = TRUE, + id = \"id\", + corstr = \"exchangeable\") \>
summary(model_gee)
:::

The list of output results is similar to that for pooled cross-sectional
data, but the standard errors are corrected using the GEE's sandwich
estimator.

# Use the R package APCI in Stata {#stata}

We also designed a Stata command apci based on the Stata command rcall
[@haghish_seamless_2019] to help implement APC-I models in Stata. The
command is used as:

apci *depvar* \[*indepvars*\], outcome(*depvar*) age(*age*)
period(*period*) family(*\"gaussian\"*) \[if\] \[in\] \[*weight*\]

Stata users can use the above command to fit APC-I models and obtain all
the results as in R. A Stata ado file for installing this command can be

# Conclusion and future development {#conclusion}

In this article, we introduced an R package
[APCI](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=APCI) and Stata command apci
for implementing the age-period-cohort-interaction (APC-I) model
developed by @luo_age-period-cohort-interaction_2020. In addition to
pooled cross-sectional data analysis, we extended the package to permit
multi-cohort longitudinal or panel data analysis. This package also
contains a set of visualization tools to help researchers motivate an
APC analysis and interpret the results. We clarify the implications of
coding schemes for estimating and testing main effects and interaction
effects in the APC-I model. We illustrate how to use this package using
the empirical examples of labor force participation using the 1990-2019
data from the Current Population Survey.

@luo_age-period-cohort-interaction_2020 described a local F test for
testing the variation associated with the multiple age-by-period
interactions contained in each cohort. Because the parameterization of
the local F test is more intricate than it appears, the R package
[APCI](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=APCI) and the Stata command
apci currently do not support such tests as of version 1.0.5 but may be
available in later versions.

Moreover, it may be of interest to examine the interaction effects of
cohort and other explanatory variables such as education and geographic
areas. Because cohort effects are conceptualized and operationalized as
a two-way interaction term of age and period effects, an interaction
term between cohort and another variable is equivalent to a three-way
interaction among age, period, and another variable. Future development
may consider creating functions to facilitate summarizing and
interpreting the more complex three-way interaction terms in the APC-I
model.

[^1]: The local deviation test is unavailable in the current version
    (1.0.5) of the R package that we develop.

[^2]: The R package [APCI](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=APCI)
    works well in R version above 3.6.0., but updating to the latest
    version of R is highly recommended.

[^3]: If users have never installed packages in R or RStudio, use the
    following R code instead: install.packages(\"APCI\", repos =
    \"http://cran.us.r-project.org\").

[^4]: Summaries for internal functions are not listed. Please see [APCI
    reference
    manual](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/APCI/APCI.pdf) for
    details about internal functions.

[^5]: The following error may appear: "Error in solve.default(V): 'a' is
    0-diml". To address this error, users may bypass the F test by
    setting the argument dev.test to FALSE.

[^6]: [APCI](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=APCI) supports all types
    of generalized linear regression models.

[^7]:  temp_model is an internal function in R package
    [APCI](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=APCI) that accepts the
    same input arguments as those in function apci. Detailed syntax of
    this function can be found in [APCI reference
    manual](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/APCI/APCI.pdf).
