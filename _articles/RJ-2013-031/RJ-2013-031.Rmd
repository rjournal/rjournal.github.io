title: 'lfe: Linear Group Fixed Effects'
abstract: Linear models with fixed effects and many dummy variables are common in
  some fields. Such models are straightforward to estimate unless the factors have
  too many levels. The R package lfe solves this problem by implementing a generalization
  of the within transformation to multiple factors, tailored for large problems.
