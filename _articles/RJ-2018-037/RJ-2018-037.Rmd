title: 'Collections in R: Review and Proposal'
abstract: R is a powerful tool for data processing, visualization, and modeling. However,
  R is slower than other languages used for similar purposes, such as Python. One
  reason for this is that R lacks base support for collections, abstract data types
  that store, manipulate, and return data (e.g., sets, maps, stacks). An exciting
  recent trend in the R extension ecosystem is the development of collection packages,
  packages that provide classes that implement common collections. At least 12 collection
  packages are available across the two major R extension repositories, the Comprehensive
  R Archive Network (CRAN) and Bioconductor. In this article, we compare collection
  packages in terms of their features, design philosophy, ease of use, and performance
  on benchmark tests. We demonstrate that, when used well, the data structures provided
  by collection packages are in many cases significantly faster than the data structures
  provided by base R. We also highlight current deficiencies among R collection packages
  and propose avenues of possible improvement. This article provides useful recommendations
  to R programmers seeking to speed up their programs and aims to inform the development
  of future collection-oriented software for R.
