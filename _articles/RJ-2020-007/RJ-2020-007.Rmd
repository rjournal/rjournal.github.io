title: 'The Rockerverse: Packages and Applications for Containerisation with R'
abstract: 'The Rocker Project provides widely used Docker images for R across different
  application scenarios. This article surveys downstream projects that build upon
  the Rocker Project images and presents the current state of R packages for managing
  Docker images and controlling containers. These use cases cover diverse topics such
  as package development, reproducible research, collaborative work, cloud-based data
  processing, and production deployment of services. The variety of applications demonstrates
  the power of the Rocker Project specifically and containerisation in general. Across
  the diverse ways to use containers, we identified common themes: reproducible environments,
  scalability and efficiency, and portability across clouds. We conclude that the
  current growth and diversification of use cases is likely to continue its positive
  impact, but see the need for consolidating the Rockerverse ecosystem of packages,
  developing common practices for applications, and exploring alternative containerisation
  software.'
