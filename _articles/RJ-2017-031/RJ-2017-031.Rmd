title: 'minval: An R package for MINimal VALidation of Stoichiometric Reactions'
abstract: A genome-scale metabolic reconstruction is a compilation of all stoichiometric
  reactions that can describe the entire cellular metabolism of an organism, and they
  have become an indispensable tool for our understanding of biological phenomena,
  covering fields that range from systems biology to bioengineering. Interrogation
  of metabolic reconstructions are generally carried through Flux Balance Analysis,
  an optimization method in which the biological sense of the optimal solution is
  highly sensitive to thermodynamic unbalance caused by the presence of stoichiometric
  reactions whose compounds are not produced or consumed in any other reaction (orphan
  metabolites) and by mass unbalance. The minval package was designed as a tool to
  identify orphan metabolites and evaluate the mass and charge balance of stoichiometric
  reactions. The package also includes functions to characterize and write models
  in TSV and SBML formats, extract all reactants, products, metabolite names and compartments
  from a metabolic reconstruction.
