title: 'Translating Probability Density Functions: From R to BUGS and Back Again'
abstract: The ability to implement statistical models in the BUGS language facilitates
  Bayesian in ference by automating MCMC algorithms. Software packages that interpret
  the BUGS language include OpenBUGS, WinBUGS, and JAGS. R packages that link BUGS
  software to the R environment, including rjags and R2WinBUGS, are widely used in
  Bayesian analysis. Indeed, many packages in the Bayesian task view on CRAN (http://cran.r-project.org/web/views/Bayesian.html)
  depend on this integration. However, the R and BUGS languages use different representations
  of common probability density functions, creating a potential for errors to occur
  in the implementation or interpre tation of analyses that use both languages. Here
  we review different parameterizations used by the R and BUGS languages, describe
  how to translate between the languages, and provide an R function, r2bugs.distributions,
  that transforms parameterizations from R to BUGS and back again.
