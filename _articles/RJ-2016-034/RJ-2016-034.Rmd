title: 'Simulating Correlated Binary and Multinomial Responses under Marginal Model
  Specification: The SimCorMultRes Package'
abstract: We developed the R package SimCorMultRes to facilitate simulation of correlated
  categori cal (binary and multinomial) responses under a desired marginal model specification.
  The simulated correlated categorical responses are obtained by applying threshold
  approaches to correlated contin uous responses of underlying regression models and
  the dependence structure is parametrized in terms of the correlation matrix of the
  latent continuous responses. This article provides an elaborate introduction to
  the SimCorMultRes package demonstrating its design and usage via three examples.
  The package can be obtained via CRAN.
