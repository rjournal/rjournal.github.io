title: 'RSSampling: A Pioneering Package for Ranked Set Sampling '
abstract: Ranked set sampling (RSS) is an advanced data collection method when the
  exact measurement of an observation is difficult and/or expensive used in a number
  of research areas, e.g., environment, bioinformatics, ecology, etc. In this method,
  random sets are drawn from a population and the units in sets are ranked with a
  ranking mechanism which is based on a visual inspection or a concomitant variable.
  Because of the importance of working with a good design and easy analysis, there
  is a need for a software tool which provides sampling designs and statistical inferences
  based on RSS and its modifications. This paper introduces an R package as a free
  and easy-to-use analysis tool for both sampling processes and statistical inferences
  based on RSS and its modified versions. For researchers, the *RSSampling* package
  provides a sample with RSS, extreme RSS, median RSS, percentile RSS, balanced groups
  RSS, double versions of RSS, L-RSS, truncation-based RSS, and robust extreme RSS
  when the judgment rankings are both perfect and imperfect. Researchers can also
  use this new package to make parametric inferences for the population mean and the
  variance where the sample is obtained via classical RSS. Moreover, this package
  includes applications of the nonparametric methods which are one sample sign test,
  Mann-Whitney-Wilcoxon test, and Wilcoxon signed-rank test procedures. The package
  is available as *RSSampling* on CRAN.

# Introduction

Data collection is the crucial part in all types of scientific research.
Ranked set sampling (RSS) is one of the advanced data collection
methods, which provides representative sample data by using the ranking
information of the sample units. It was firstly proposed by [@Mc52] and
the term \"ranked set sampling\" was introduced in the study of
[@hall66] about the estimation of forage yields in a pine hardwood
forest. [@takwak68] theoretically studied the efficiency of the mean
estimator based on RSS which is unbiased for the population mean. They
found that its variance is always smaller than the variance of the mean
estimator based on simple random sampling (SRS) with the same sample
size when the ranking is perfect. Some other results on the efficiency
of RSS can be found in [@dellclut], [@david72], and [@stok80]. [@stok77]
studied the use of concomitant variables for ranking of the sample units
in the RSS procedure and found that the ranking procedure was allowed to
be imperfect. In another study, she constructed the estimator for the
population variance in the presence of the ranking error [@stokvar]. For
some examples and results on the regression estimation based on RSS,
see, [@philip1997regression] and [@Chen2001]. The estimation of a
distribution function with various settings of RSS can be found in
[@stoksag], [@kvam], and [@chen00]. Other results on distribution-free
test procedures based on RSS can be found in [@bohn92; @bohn94], and
[@Hett95]. Additional results for inferential procedures based on RSS
can be found in the recent works of [@zamanzade2015variance],
[@zhang2016jackknife], and [@ozturk2018ratio]. For more details on RSS,
we refer the review papers by [@kaur1995ranked], [@chen2003ranked], and
[@b24].

The RSS method and its modified versions have come into prominence
recently due to its efficiency and therefore new software tools or
packages for a quick evaluation is required. A free software called
Visual Sample Plan (VSP) created by Pacific Northwest National
Labaratory has many sampling designs including classical RSS method for
developing environmental sampling plans under balanced and unbalanced
cases. It provides the calculation of the required sample size and cost
information with the location to be sampled. Also, a package
[*NSM3*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=NSM3) by
[@schneider2015nsm3] in R has two functions related to classical RSS
method. It only provides the Monte Carlo samples and computes a
statistic for a nonparametric procedure. Both the VSP and *NSM3* package
include only the classical RSS method as a sampling procedure and
provide limited methods for inference. Therefore, there is no extensive
package for sampling and statistical inference using both classical and
modified RSS methods in any available software packages. In this study,
we propose a pioneering package, named
[*RSSampling*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=RSSampling), for
sampling procedures based on the classical RSS and the modified RSS
methods in both perfect and imperfect ranking cases. Also, the package
provides the estimation of the mean and the variance of the population
and allows the use of the one sample sign, Mann-Whitney-Wilcoxon, and
Wilcoxon signed-rank test procedures under classical RSS. The
organization of the paper is as follows: in the following section, we
give some brief information about classical RSS and modified RSS
methods. Then, we introduce the details of *RSSampling* package and
further, we give some illustrative examples with a real data analysis.
In the last section, we give the conclusion of the study.

# The classical and modified RSS methods

RSS and its modifications are advanced sampling methods using the rank
information of the sample units. The ranking of the units can be done by
visual inspection of a human expert or a concomitant variable. The
procedure for the RSS method is as follows:

1.  Select $m$ units at random from a specified population.

2.  Rank these $m$ units by judgment without actual measurement.

3.  Keep the smallest judged unit from the ranked set.

4.  Select second set of $m$ units at random from a specified
    population, rank these units without measuring them, keep the second
    smallest judged unit.

5.  Continue the process until $m$ ranked units are measured.

The first five steps are referred to as a cycle. Then, the cycle repeats
$r$ times and a ranked set sample of size $n=$$mr$ is obtained. Figure
[1](#fgrrss3) illustrates the RSS procedure with visual inspection for
the case of $r=1$ and $m=3$, and in the following scheme, $X_{i(j:m)}$
represents the $j$th ranked unit in $i$th set where $i=1,2,\dots,m$ and
$j=1,2,\dots,m$ and bold units represent the units which are chosen to
ranked set sample.

$$\begin{pmatrix}
\mathbf{X_{1(1:3)}} \leq & X_{1(2:3)}\leq &X_{1(3:3)}  \\
X_{2(1:3)} \leq & \mathbf{X_{2(2:3)}}\leq &X_{2(3:3)}  \\
X_{3(1:3)} \leq & X_{3(2:3)}\leq &\mathbf{X_{3(3:3)}}
\end{pmatrix}$$

RSS design obtains more representative samples and gives more precise
estimates of the population parameters relative to SRS [@epa]. The main
difference between the RSS method and the other modified methods is the
selection procedure of the sample units from the ranked sets. For
example, [@samawiex] suggested extreme RSS using the minimum or maximum
units from each ranked set. [@mutlak97] introduced median RSS using only
median units of the random sets. [@jemain2008some] suggested balanced
groups RSS which is defined as the combination of extreme RSS and median
RSS. For additional examples of modified methods, see [@MUTTLAK03],
[@AlSaleh2000], and for robust methods see, [@al2007ranked],
[@al2013estimation], and [@al2009robust]. In literature, the studies for
modified RSS methods are generally interested in obtaining a sample more
easily or making a more robust estimation for a population parameter.
Such studies are made for the investigation of properties (for example,
bias and mean squared error) of a proposed estimator and they have
generally focused on the comparisons of SRS and RSS methods. Note that
the true comparisons of the modified RSS methods to the others are
difficult to present in general terms. Because the advantages of the
sampling methods, when compared to each other, may vary according to the
situations such as the parameter to be estimated, underlying
distribution, the presence of ranking error, etc.Â For more detailed
information on the modifications of RSS, see [@al2014review] and
references therein. In the following, the modified RSS methods which are
considered in *RSSampling* are introduced.

## Extreme RSS 

Extreme RSS (ERSS) is the first modification of RSS suggested by
[@samawiex] to estimate the population mean only using the minimum or
maximum ranked units from each set. The procedure for ERSS can be
described as follows: select $m$ random sets each of size $m$ units from
the population and rank the units within each set by a human expert or a
concomitant variable. If the set size $m$ is even, the lowest ranked
units of each set are chosen from the first $m/2$ sets, and the largest
ranked units of each set are chosen from the other $m/2$ sets. If the
set size is odd, the lowest ranked units from the first $(m-1)/2$ sets,
the largest ranked units from the other $(m-1)/2$ sets and median unit
from the remaining last set are chosen. If we repeat the procedure $r$
times, we have a sample of size $n = mr$. An example of the procedure
for $r=1$ and $m=4$ is shown below.

$$\begin{pmatrix}
\mathbf{X_{1(1:4)}} \leq & X_{1(2:4)}\leq &X_{1(3:4)}\leq &X_{1(4:4)}  \\
\mathbf{X_{2(1:4)}} \leq & X_{2(2:4)}\leq &X_{2(3:4)}\leq &X_{2(4:4)}  \\
X_{3(1:4)} \leq & X_{3(2:4)}\leq &X_{3(3:4)}\leq &\mathbf{X_{3(4:4)}}  \\
X_{4(1:4)} \leq & X_{4(2:4)}\leq &X_{4(3:4)}\leq &\mathbf{X_{4(4:4)}}
\end{pmatrix}$$

## Median RSS 

Median RSS (MRSS) was suggested by [@mutlak97]. In this method, only
median units of the random sets are chosen as the sample for estimation
of population mean. For the odd set sizes, the $((m+1)/2)$th ranked
units are chosen as the median of each set. For even set sizes, the
$(m/2)$th ranked units are chosen from the first $m/2$ sets and the
$((m+2)/2)$th ranked units are chosen from the remaining $m/2$ sets. If
necessary, procedure can be repeated $r$ times and we have $n=mr$ sample
of size. An example of the procedure for $r=1$ and $m=3$ is shown below.

$$\begin{pmatrix}
X_{1(1:3)} \leq & \mathbf{X_{1(2:3)}}\leq &X_{1(3:3)}  \\
X_{2(1:3)} \leq & \mathbf{X_{2(2:3)}}\leq &X_{2(3:3)}  \\
X_{3(1:3)} \leq & \mathbf{X_{3(2:3)}}\leq &X_{3(3:3)}
\end{pmatrix}$$

## Percentile RSS 

[@MUTTLAK03] suggested another modification for the RSS, percentile RSS
(PRSS), where only the upper and lower percentiles of the random sets
are chosen as the sample for selected value of $p$, where
$0 \leq p \leq 1$. Suppose that $m$ random sets with the size $m$ are
chosen from a specific population to sample $m$ units and ranked
visually or with a concomitant variable. If the set size is even, the
$(p(m+1))$th smallest units from the first $m/2$ sets and the
$((1-p)(m+1))$th smallest units from the other $m/2$ sets are chosen. If
$m$ is odd, the $(p(m+1))$th smallest units are chosen from the first
$(m-1)/2$ sets, the $((1-p)(m+1))$th smallest units are chosen from the
other $(m-1)/2$ sets and the median unit is chosen as the $m$th unit
from the last set. An example of the procedure for $r=1$, $m=5$ and
$p=0.3$ is as below.

$$\begin{pmatrix}
X_{1(1:5)} \leq & \mathbf{X_{1(2:5)}}\leq &X_{1(3:5)}\leq &X_{1(4:5)}\leq &X_{1(5:5)}  \\
X_{2(1:5)} \leq & \mathbf{X_{2(2:5)}}\leq &X_{2(3:5)}\leq &X_{2(4:5)}\leq &X_{2(5:5)}  \\
X_{3(1:5)} \leq & X_{3(2:5)}\leq &X_{3(3:5)}\leq &\mathbf{X_{3(4:5)}}\leq &X_{3(5:5)}\\
X_{4(1:5)} \leq & X_{4(2:5)}\leq &X_{4(3:5)}\leq &\mathbf{X_{4(4:5)}} \leq &X_{4(5:5)} \\
X_{5(1:5)} \leq & X_{5(2:5)}\leq &\mathbf{X_{5(3:5)}}\leq &X_{5(4:5)}\leq &X_{5(5:5)}
\end{pmatrix}$$

## Balanced groups RSS

Balanced groups RSS (BGRSS) can be defined as the combination of ERSS
and MRSS. [@jemain2008some] suggested to use BGRSS for estimating the
population mean with a special sample size $m = 3k$. In their study,
BGRSS procedure can be described as follows: $m=3k$ (where
$k=1,2,3,\dots$ ) sets each size of $m$ are selected randomly from a
specific population. The sets are randomly allocated into three groups
and units in each set are ranked. The smallest units from the first
group, median units from the second group and the largest units from the
third group of ranked sets are chosen. When the set size is odd, the
median unit in the second group is defined as the $((m+1)/2)$th ranked
unit in the set and when the set size is even, the median unit is
defined as the mean of the $(m/2)$th and the $((m+2)/2)$th ranked units.
BGRSS process for one cycle and $k=2$ can be described as below.

$$\begin{pmatrix}
\mathbf{X_{1(1:6)}}\leq &X_{1(2:6)}\leq &X_{1(3:6)}\leq &X_{1(4:6)}\leq &X_{1(5:6)}\leq &X_{1(6:6)}  \\
\mathbf{X_{2(1:6)}}\leq & X_{2(2:6)}\leq &X_{2(3:6)}\leq &X_{2(4:6)}\leq &X_{2(5:6)}\leq &X_{2(6:6)}  \\
X_{3(1:6)} \leq & X_{3(2:6)}\leq &\mathbf{X_{3(3:6)}}\leq &\mathbf{X_{3(4:6)}}\leq &X_{3(5:6)}\leq &X_{3(6:6)}\\
X_{4(1:6)} \leq & X_{4(2:6)}\leq &\mathbf{X_{4(3:6)}}\leq &\mathbf{X_{4(4:6)}}\leq &X_{4(5:6)}\leq &X_{4(6:6)} \\
X_{5(1:6)} \leq & X_{5(2:6)}\leq &X_{5(3:6)}\leq &X_{5(4:6)}\leq &X_{5(5:6)}\leq &\mathbf{X_{5(6:6)}} \\
X_{6(1:6)} \leq & X_{6(2:6)}\leq &X_{6(3:6)}\leq &X_{6(4:6)}\leq &X_{6(5:6)}\leq &\mathbf{X_{6(6:6)}}
\end{pmatrix}$$

## Double RSS 

[@AlSaleh2000] introduced another modification of RSS, that is double
RSS (DRSS) as a beginning of multistage procedure. Several researchers
also extended the DRSS method to modified versions such as double
extreme RSS (DERSS) by [@samawi2002doubleext], double median RSS (DMRSS)
by [@samawi2002double], and double percentile RSS (DPRSS) by
[@jemain2006double]. The DRSS procedure is described as follows: $m^3$
units are identified from the target population and divided randomly
into $m$ groups, the size of each is $m^2$. Then, the usual RSS
procedure is used on each group to obtain $m$ ranked set samples each of
size $m$. Finally, RSS procedure is applied again on the obtained ranked
set samples in the previous step to get a double ranked set sample of
size $m$.

## L-RSS 

L-RSS, which is a robust RSS procedure, is based on the idea of L
statistic and it was introduced by [@al2007ranked] as a generalization
of different type of RSS methods. The first step for L-RSS procedure is
selecting $m$ random sets with $m$ units and ranking the units in each
set. Let $k$ be the L-RSS coefficient, where
$k=\lfloor m \alpha \rfloor$ for $0 \leq \alpha < 0.5$ and
$\lfloor m\alpha \rfloor$ is the largest integer value less than or
equal to $m \alpha$. Then, the $(k+1)$th ranked units from the first
$k+1$ sets, $(m-k)$th ranked units from the last $k+1$ sets and $i$th
ranked units from the remaining sets which are numbered with $i$, where
$i=k+2,\ldots,m-k-1$ are selected. The L-RSS procedure for the case of
$m=6$ and $k=1$ ($\alpha=0.20$) in a cycle can be shown as below:

$$\begin{pmatrix}
X_{1(1:6)} \leq & \mathbf{X_{1(2:6)}}\leq &X_{1(3:6)}\leq &X_{1(4:6)}\leq &X_{1(5:6)}\leq &X_{1(6:6)}  \\
X_{2(1:6)} \leq & \mathbf{X_{2(2:6)}}\leq &X_{2(3:6)}\leq &X_{2(4:6)}\leq &X_{2(5:6)}\leq &X_{2(6:6)}  \\
X_{3(1:6)} \leq & X_{3(2:6)}\leq &\mathbf{X_{3(3:6)}}\leq &X_{3(4:6)}\leq &X_{3(5:6)}\leq &X_{3(6:6)}\\
X_{4(1:6)} \leq & X_{4(2:6)}\leq &X_{4(3:6)}\leq &\mathbf{X_{4(4:6)}}\leq &X_{4(5:6)}\leq &X_{4(6:6)} \\
X_{5(1:6)} \leq & X_{5(2:6)}\leq &X_{5(3:6)}\leq &X_{5(4:6)}\leq &\mathbf{X_{5(5:6)}}\leq &X_{5(6:6)} \\
X_{6(1:6)} \leq & X_{6(2:6)}\leq &X_{6(3:6)}\leq &X_{6(4:6)}\leq &\mathbf{X_{6(5:6)}}\leq &X_{6(6:6)}
\end{pmatrix}$$

When $k=0$, then this procedure leads to the classical RSS and when
$k=\lfloor (m-1)/2 \rfloor$, then it leads to the MRSS method.

## Truncation-based RSS 

The truncation-based RSS (TBRSS) was presented by [@al2013estimation].
This procedure can be summarized as follows: select randomly $m$ sets
each of size $m$ units from the population and rank the units in each
set. Then, determine TBRSS coefficient $k$ as in the L-RSS method and
select the minimums of the first $k$ sets and the maximums of the last
$k$ sets. From the remaining $m-2k$ samples, select the $i$th ranked
unit of the $i$th sample $(k+1 \leq i  \leq m-k)$. The one cycled TBRSS
method for the case of $m=8$ and $k=2$ ($\alpha=0.35$) is shown below.

$$\begin{pmatrix}
\mathbf{X_{1(1:8)}}\leq & X_{1(2:8)}\leq &X_{1(3:8)}\leq &X_{1(4:8)}\leq &X_{1(5:8)}\leq &X_{1(6:8)}\leq &X_{1(7:8)}\leq &X_{1(8:8)}  \\
\mathbf{X_{2(1:8)}}\leq &X_{2(2:8)}\leq &X_{2(3:8)}\leq &X_{2(4:8)}\leq &X_{2(5:8)}\leq &X_{2(6:8)}\leq &X_{2(7:8)}\leq &X_{2(8:8)}  \\
X_{3(1:8)}\leq &X_{3(2:8)}\leq &\mathbf{X_{3(3:8)}}\leq &X_{3(4:8)}\leq &X_{3(5:8)}\leq &X_{3(6:8)}\leq &X_{3(7:8)}\leq &X_{3(8:8)} \\
X_{4(1:8)}\leq &X_{4(2:8)}\leq &X_{4(3:8)}\leq &\mathbf{X_{4(4:8)}}\leq &X_{4(5:8)}\leq &X_{4(6:8)}\leq &X_{4(7:8)}\leq &X_{4(8:8)}\\
X_{5(1:8)}\leq &X_{5(2:8)}\leq &X_{5(3:8)}\leq &X_{5(4:8)}\leq &\mathbf{X_{5(5:8)}}\leq &X_{5(6:8)}\leq &X_{5(7:8)}\leq &X_{5(8:8)} \\
X_{6(1:8)}\leq &X_{6(2:8)}\leq &X_{6(3:8)}\leq &X_{6(4:8)}\leq &X_{6(5:8)}\leq &\mathbf{X_{6(6:8)}}\leq &X_{6(7:8)}\leq &X_{6(8:8)} \\
X_{7(1:8)}\leq &X_{7(2:8)}\leq &X_{7(3:8)}\leq &X_{7(4:8)}\leq &X_{7(5:8)}\leq &X_{7(6:8)}\leq &X_{7(7:8)}\leq &\mathbf{X_{7(8:8)}} \\
X_{8(1:8)}\leq &X_{8(2:8)}\leq &X_{8(3:8)}\leq &X_{8(4:8)}\leq &X_{8(5:8)}\leq &X_{8(6:8)}\leq &X_{8(7:8)}\leq &\mathbf{X_{8(8:8)}}
\end{pmatrix}$$

Note that when $k = 0$ or $k = 1$, TBRSS scheme is equivalent to the
classical RSS scheme.

## Robust extreme RSS

Robust extreme RSS (RERSS) scheme was introduced by [@al2009robust].
This method can be described as follows: identify $m$ random sets with
$m$ units and rank the units within each set. Select the $(k+1)$th
ranked units from the first $m/2$ sets where
$k=\lfloor m \alpha \rfloor$ for $0 < \alpha < 0.5$ and
$\lfloor m\alpha \rfloor$ is the largest integer value less than or
equal to $m \alpha$. Then, select the $(m-k)$th ranked units from the
other $m/2$ sets. If the set size $m$ is odd, $((m+1)/2)$th ranked unit
is selected additionally from the last remaining set. The procedure for
one cycle and the case of $m=6$ and $k=1$ ($\alpha=0.20$) can be shown
as below.

$$\begin{pmatrix}
X_{1(1:6)} \leq & \mathbf{X_{1(2:6)}}\leq &X_{1(3:6)}\leq &X_{1(4:6)}\leq &X_{1(5:6)}\leq &X_{1(6:6)}  \\
X_{2(1:6)} \leq & \mathbf{X_{2(2:6)}}\leq &X_{2(3:6)}\leq &X_{2(4:6)}\leq &X_{2(5:6)}\leq &X_{2(6:6)}  \\
X_{3(1:6)} \leq & \mathbf{X_{3(2:6)}}\leq &X_{3(3:6)}\leq &X_{3(4:6)}\leq &X_{3(5:6)}\leq &X_{3(6:6)}\\
X_{4(1:6)} \leq & X_{4(2:6)}\leq &X_{4(3:6)}\leq &X_{4(4:6)}\leq &\mathbf{X_{4(5:6)}}\leq &X_{4(6:6)} \\
X_{5(1:6)} \leq & X_{5(2:6)}\leq &X_{5(3:6)}\leq &X_{5(4:6)}\leq &\mathbf{X_{5(5:6)}}\leq &X_{5(6:6)} \\
X_{6(1:6)} \leq & X_{6(2:6)}\leq &X_{6(3:6)}\leq &X_{6(4:6)}\leq &\mathbf{X_{6(5:6)}}\leq &X_{6(6:6)}
\end{pmatrix}$$

If $k=0$ and $k=(m/2)$, then this sampling procedure corresponds to ERSS
and MRSS methods, respectively.

# *RSSampling* package {#RSSamplingpackage}

The package *RSSampling* is available on CRAN and can be installed and
loaded via the following commands:

``` r
> install.packages("RSSampling")
> library("RSSampling")
```

The package depends on the
[*stats*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=stats) package and uses a
function from the non-standard package
[*LearnBayes*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=LearnBayes) [@jim] for
random data generation in the Examples section. The proposed package
consists of two main parts which are the functions for sampling methods
described in Table [1](#tablo) and the functions for inference
procedures described in Table [2](#infer) based on RSS. The sampling
part of the package includes perfect and imperfect rankings with a
concomitant variable allowing researchers to sample with classical RSS
and the modified versions. The functions for inference procedures
provide estimation for parameters and some hypothesis testing procedures
based on RSS.

## Sampling with *RSSampling* 

In this part, we introduce a core function, which is called
`rankedsets`, to obtain `s` ranked sets consisting of randomly chosen
sample units with the set size $m$. By using this function, we developed
the functions given in Table [1](#tablo) which provide researchers means
to obtain a sample under different sampling schemes. One can also use
`rankedsets` function for the studies based on other modified RSS
methods which are not mentioned in this paper.

The function `rss` provides the ranked set sample with perfect ranking
from a specific data set, $X$, provided in matrix form where the columns
and rows represent the sets and cycles, respectively. One can see the
randomly chosen ranked sets by defining `sets = TRUE` (default
`sets = FALSE`) with the set size $m$ and the cycle size $r$. For the
modified RSS methods, the function `Mrss` provides a sample from MRSS,
ERSS, PRSS, and BGRSS which are represented by `"m"`,`"e"`, `"p"`, and
`"bg"`, respectively. The `type = "r"`, defined as the default,
represents the classical RSS. For the sampling procedure PRSS, there is
an additional parameter `p` which defines the percentile. We note that,
when `p = 0.25` in PRSS, one can obtain a sample with quartile RSS given
by [@muttlak2003investigating]. `Rrss` provides samples from L-RSS,
TBRSS, and RERSS methods which are represented by `"l"`, `"tb"`, and
`"re"`, respectively. The parameter `alpha` is the common parameter for
these methods and defines the cutting value. `Drss` function is for
double versions of RSS, MRSS, ERSS, and PRSS under perfect ranking.
`type = "d"` is defined as the default which represents the double RSS.
Values `"dm"`, `"de"`, and `"dp"` are defined for DMRSS, DERSS, and
DPRSS methods, respectively.

In the literature, most of the theoretical inferences and numerical
studies are conducted based on perfect ranking. However, in real life
applications, the ranking process is done with an expert judgment or a
concomitant variable. Let us consider RSS with a concomitant variable
$Y$. A set of $m$ units is drawn from the population, then the units are
ranked by the order of $Y$. The concomitant variable $Y_{i(j:m)}$
represents the $j$th ranked unit in $i$th set and the variable of
interest $X_{(i,j)}$ represents the $j$th unit in $i$th set, where
$i=1,2,\dots,m$ and $j=1,2,\dots,m$. In the following example, the
procedure of RSS using $Y$ is given for $m=3$.

$$\begin{matrix}
(\mathbf{Y_{1(1:3)}}, \mathbf{X_{(1,1)}}) \leq & (Y_{1(2:3)}, X_{(1,2)}) \leq & (Y_{1(3:3)}, X_{(1,3)}) & \longrightarrow & \mathbf{X_{(1,1)}} \\
(Y_{2(1:3)}, X_{(2,1)}) \leq & (\mathbf{Y_{2(2:3)}}, \mathbf{X_{(2,2)}}) \leq & (Y_{2(3:3)}, X_{(2,3)}) & \longrightarrow & \mathbf{X_{(2,2)}} \\
(Y_{3(1:3)}, X_{(3,1)}) \leq & (Y_{3(2:3)}, X_{(3,2)}) \leq & (\mathbf{Y_{3(3:3)}}, \mathbf{X_{(3,3)}}) & \longrightarrow & \mathbf{X_{(3,3)}}
\end{matrix}$$

The functions `con.rss`, `con.Mrss`, and `con.Rrss` provide methods to
obtain a sample under imperfect ranking. With the `con.rss` function, a
researcher can obtain a classical ranked set sample from a specific data
set using a concomitant variable $Y$ with the set size $m$ and cycle
size $r$ to make inference about the variable of interest $X$. The
functions `con.Mrss` and `con.Rrss` have similar usage with `con.rss`
function except the selection method which is defined by `type`
parameter. Also, these functions are simply extensions of the `Mrss` and
`Rrss` for concomitant variable cases.

In a real-world research, the values of the variable of interest $X$ are
unknown and the researchers measure $X$ values of the sample units after
choosing them from the population with a specific sampling method. The
function `obsno.Mrss` provides the code for this kind of application,
when the researchers prefer to use RSS methods. After determining the
sample frame and the concomitant variable to be used for ranking, the
code provides the number of the units to be selected according the
values of the concomitant variable. Then, the researcher obtain easily
the observation numbers of the units which will be chosen to the sample.
`type = "r"` is defined as the default which represents the classical
RSS. MRSS, ERSS, PRSS, and BGRSS are represented by `"m"` , `"e"`,
`"p"`, and `"bg"`, respectively.

## Inference with *RSSampling* 

Statistical inference refers to the process of drawing conclusions and
having an information about the interested population. Researchers are
generally interested in fundamental inferences for the parameters such
as mean and variance. Using the *RSSampling* package, we provide an easy
way to estimate the parameters about the interested population and to
use some distribution-free tests; namely the sign,
Mann-Whitney-Wilcoxon, and Wilcoxon signed-rank tests for nonparametric
inference when the sampling procedure is RSS.

::: {#infer}

  ---------------- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  : Table 2: The functions for inference in *RSSampling* package
:::

The `meanRSS` function provides point estimation, confidence interval
estimation, and asymptotic hypothesis testing for the population mean
based on RSS see, [@chen2003ranked]. For the variance estimation based
on RSS, we define `varRSS` function which has two `type` parameters;
`"Stokes"` and `"Montip"`. [@stokvar] proved that estimator of variance
is asymptotically unbiased regardless of presence of ranking error. For
the `"Montip"` type estimation, [@tiensuwan2003estimation] showed that
there is no unbiased estimator of variance for one cycle but they
proposed unbiased estimator of variance for more than one cycle. With
`regRSS` function, regression estimator for mean of interested
population can be obtained based on RSS. The $\beta$ coefficient (`"B"`
in `regRSS` function) is calculated under the assumption of known
population mean for concomitant $Y$. Note that, the ranked set samples
for interested variable $X$ and for concomitant variable $Y$ must be the
same length. One can find the detailed information about regression
estimator based on RSS in [@philip1997regression].

Finally, for nonparametric inference, `sign1testrss`, `mwwutestrss`, and
`wsrtestrss` functions implement, respectively, the sign test, the
Mann-Whitney-Wilcoxon test, and the Wilcoxon signed-rank test depending
on RSS. The normal approximation is used to construct the test
statistics and an approximate confidence intervals. For detailed
information on these test methods, see the book of [@chen2003ranked].

# Examples

In this section, we present examples illustrating the *RSSampling*
package.

## Sampling with TBRSS using a concomitant variable

This example shows the process to obtain a sample by using TBRSS method
for the variable of interest, $X$, ranked by using the concomitant
variable $Y$ assuming that they are distributed as multivariate normal.
We determined the set size `m` is 4 and the cycle size `r` is 2. The
ranked sets of $Y$ and the sets of $X$ are obtained using the function
`con.Rrss`. Thus, the resultant sample for $X$ is given as below.

## Obtaining observation number in MRSS method

Random determination of the sample units is an important task for
practitioners. The function `obsno.Mrss` is for the practitioners who
have the frame of the population with unknown variable $X$ and known
concomitant variable $Y$. In the following example, the observation
numbers for median ranked set sample units are obtained in order to take
the measurement of the interested variable $X$.

``` r

	## Loading packages
	library("RSSampling")

	## Generating concomitant variable (Y) from exponential dist.
	set.seed(5)
	y = rexp(10000)

	## Determining the observation numbers of the units which are chosen to sample
	obsno.Mrss(y, m = 3, r = 5, type = "m")

	               m = 1        m = 2        m = 3
	      r = 1 "Obs.  2452" "Obs.  6417" "Obs.  3227"
	      r = 2 "Obs.  9094" "Obs.  1805" "Obs.  9877"
	      r = 3 "Obs.  1333" "Obs.  9252" "Obs.  3219"
	      r = 4 "Obs.  6397" "Obs.  7038" "Obs.  5019"
	      r = 5 "Obs.  446"  "Obs.  9663" "Obs.  10"
```

## A simulation study based on RSS using a concomitant variable

In order to illustrate the usage of the package, we give a simulation
study with 10,000 repetitions for mean estimation of $X$ based on RSS
method using a concomitant variable. It demonstrates the effect of the
correlation level between $X$ and $Y$ on the mean squared error (MSE) of
estimation. Samples are obtained when `m = 5` and r = 10 assuming that
$X$ and $Y$ are distributed as multivariate normal. Figure [2](#mse) as
an output of the simulation study indicates that when the correlation
level is increasing, MSE values are decreasing.

## A real data example

In this real data example, we used the abolone data set which is freely
available at
<https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/abalone/abalone.data>.
The data consists of $9$ variables of $4177$ units and the variables
are; sex (Male/Female/Infant), length (mm), diameter (mm), height (mm),
whole weight (grams), shucked weight (grams), viscera weight (grams),
shell weight (grams), and rings ($+1.5$ gives the age of abalone in
years), respectively. The data comes from an original study of the
population biology of abalone by [@nash1994population]. Also,
[@cetintav2016mean] and [@sevincc2018partial] used the abalone data set
for application of the fuzzy based modification of RSS and partial
groups RSS methods, respectively. The data set can be obtained easily by
using the following R command.

``` r
abaloneData <- read.csv(url("https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases
\               /abalone/abalone.data"), header = FALSE, col.names = c("sex", "length",
\               "diameter", "height", "whole.weight", "shucked.weight", "viscera.weight",
\               "shell.weight", "rings"))
```

Suppose that we aimed to estimate the mean of $viscera$ $weight$ and
confidence interval and also test the hypothesis claiming that the mean
of the $viscera$ $weight$ is equal to $0.18$. The measurement of
$viscera$ $weight$ which is the gut weight of abalone after bleeding is
an expensive and time-consuming process. Because the measurement of
$whole$ $weight$ is easy and highly correlated with $viscera$ $weight$
(the correlation coefficient is $0.966$), we used $whole$ $weight$ as
the concomitant variable to obtain a sample of size $25$ in RSS method.
We have the following results for $viscera$ $weight$.

``` r
cor(abaloneData\$viscera.weight, abaloneData\$whole.weight)
[1] 0.9663751
```

``` r
set.seed(50)
sampleRSS = con.rss(abaloneData\$viscera.weight, abaloneData\$whole.weight, m = 5, r = 5,
\                    sets = TRUE, concomitant = FALSE)\$sample.x

meanRSS(sampleRSS, m = 5, r = 5, alpha = 0.05, alternative = "two.sided", mu_0 = 0.18)
\$mean
[1] 0.17826

\$CI
[1] 0.1293705 0.2271495

\$z.test
[1] -0.06975604

\$p.value
[1] 0.9443878

varRSS(sampleRSS, m = 5, r = 5, type = "Stokes")
[1] 0.0135364
```

The results from our sample data indicate that the estimated mean and
the variance are $0.17826$ and $0.01354$, respectively. According to the
hypothesis testing result, we conclude that there is no strong evidence
against the null hypothesis (`p.value`$>0.05$).

# Conclusion

RSS is an efficient data collection method compared to SRS especially in
situations where the measurement of a unit is expensive but the ranking
is less costly. In this study, we propose a package which obtains sample
from RSS and its modifications and provide functions to allow some
inferential procedures by RSS. We create a set of functions for sampling
under both perfect and imperfect rankings with a concomitant variable.
For the inferential procedures, we consider mean, variance, and
regression estimator and sign, Mann-Whitney-Wilcoxon, and Wilcoxon
signed-rank tests for the distribution free tests. Proposed functions in
the package are illustrated with the examples and analysis of a real
data is given. Future improvements of the package may be provided by
adding new inference procedures based on RSS methods.
