title: 'milr: Multiple-Instance Logistic Regression with Lasso Penalty'
abstract: The purpose of the milr package is to analyze multiple-instance data. Ordinary
  multiple instance data consists of many independent bags, and each bag is composed
  of several instances. The statuses of bags and instances are binary. Moreover, the
  statuses of instances are not observed, whereas the statuses of bags are observed.
  The functions in this package are applicable for analyzing multiple-instance data,
  simulating data via logistic regression, and selecting important covariates in the
  regression model. To this end, maximum likelihood estimation with an expectation-maximization
  algorithm is implemented for model estimation, and a lasso penalty added to the
  likelihood function is applied for variable selection. Additionally, an "milr" object
  is applicable to generic functions fitted, predict and summary. Simulated data and
  a real example are given to demonstrate the features of this package.
