title: Fitting Conditional and Simultaneous Autoregressive Spatial Models in hglm
abstract: We present a new version (> 2.0) of the hglm package for fitting hierarchical
  generalized linear models (HGLMs) with spatially correlated random effects. CAR()
  and SAR() families for con ditional and simultaneous autoregressive random effects
  were implemented. Eigen decomposition of the matrix describing the spatial structure
  (e.g., the neighborhood matrix) was used to transform the CAR/SAR random effects
  into an independent, but heteroscedastic, Gaussian random effect. A linear predictor
  is fitted for the random effect variance to estimate the parameters in the CAR and
  SAR models. This gives a computationally efficient algorithm for moderately sized
  problems.
