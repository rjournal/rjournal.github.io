title: Fitting Conditional and Simultaneous Autoregressive Spatial Models in hglm
abstract: We present a new version ($\geqslant 2.0$) of the *hglm* package for fitting
  hierarchical generalized linear models (HGLMs) with spatially correlated random
  effects. `CAR()` and `SAR()` families for conditional and simultaneous autoregressive
  random effects were implemented. Eigen decomposition of the matrix describing the
  spatial structure (e.g., the neighborhood matrix) was used to transform the CAR/SAR
  random effects into an independent, but heteroscedastic, Gaussian random effect.
  A linear predictor is fitted for the random effect variance to estimate the parameters
  in the CAR and SAR models. This gives a computationally efficient algorithm for
  moderately sized problems.

# Introduction

We present an algorithm for fitting spatial generalized linear models
with conditional and simultaneous autoregressive [CAR & SAR;
@Besag1974; @Cressie] random effects. The algorithm completely avoids
the need to differentiate the spatial correlation matrix by transforming
the model using an eigen decomposition of the precision matrix. This
enables the use of already existing methods for hierarchical generalized
linear models [HGLMs; @LeeNelder96] and this algorithm is implemented in
the latest version ($\geqslant$ 2.0) of the
[*hglm*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=hglm) package [@Ronnegard1].

The *hglm* package, up to version 1.2-8, provides the functionality for
fitting HGLMs with uncorrelated random effects using an extended quasi
likelihood method [EQL; @LN06]. The new version includes a first order
correction of the fixed effects based on the current EQL fitting
algorithm, which is more precise than EQL for models having non-normal
outcomes [@Lee2012]. Similar to the h-likelihood correction of @Noh07,
it corrects the estimates of the fixed effects and thereby also reduces
potential bias in the estimates of the dispersion parameters for the
random effects (variance components). The improvement in terms of
reduced bias is substantial for models with a large number of levels in
the random effect [@Noh07], which is often the case for spatial
generalized linear mixed models (GLMMs).

Earlier versions of the package allow modeling of the dispersion
parameter of the conditional mean model, with fixed effects, but not the
dispersion parameter(s) of the random effects. The current
implementation, however, enables the user to specify a linear predictor
for each dispersion parameter of the random effects. Adding this option
was a natural extension to the package because it allowed implementation
of our proposed algorithm that fits CAR and SAR random effects.

Though the CAR/SAR models are widely used for spatial data analysis
there are not many software packages which can be used for their model
fitting. GLMMs with CAR/SAR random effects are often fitted in a
Bayesian way using BUGS software [e.g., WinBUGS; @Lunn00 or alike],
which leads to extremely slow computation due to its dependence on
Markov chain Monte Carlo simulations. The R package *INLA* [@INLA2013]
provides a relatively fast Bayesian computation of spatial HGLMs via
Laplace approximation of the posterior distribution where the model
development has focused on continuous domain spatial modeling
[@INLA2015] whereas less focus has been on discrete models including CAR
and SAR. Recently, package
[*spaMM*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=spaMM) [@spamm] was
developed to fit spatial HGLMs but is rather slow even for moderately
sized data. Here, we extend package *hglm* to also provide fast
computation of HGLMs with CAR and SAR random effects and at the same
time an attempt has been made to improve the accuracy of the estimates
by including corrections for the fixed effects.

The rest of the paper is organized as follows. First we give an
introduction to CAR and SAR structures and present the h-likelihood
theory together with the eigen decomposition of the covariance matrix of
the CAR random effects and show how it simplifies the computation of the
model. Then we present the R implementation, show the use of the
implementation for two real data examples and evaluate the package using
simulations. The last section concludes the article.

# CAR and SAR structures in HGLMs

HGLMs with spatially correlated random effects are commonly used in
spatial data analysis [@Cressie; @wall]. A spatial HGLM with Gaussian
CAR random effects is given by

$$\begin{aligned}
\label{eq:1} 
 & E\left(z_s | u_s\right) \quad && = && \quad \mu_s, \quad \quad \quad \quad \quad s  = 1,2,\ldots,n,  \nonumber\\
& g\left(\mu_s\right) \quad = \quad \eta_s \quad && = && \quad \mathbf{X}_s\mathbf{\beta} + \mathbf{Z}_s u_s,   
\end{aligned}   (\#eq:1)$$

$$\label{eq:2}  
z_s|u_s \sim Exponential~Family,   (\#eq:2)$$

with $z_s|u_s \perp z_t|u_t$, $\forall s \ne t$ and

$$\label{eq:3}  
\mathbf{u} = \left(u_1 , u_2 , \dots , u_n\right)^{T} \sim N\left(\mathbf{0}, \Sigma = \tau\left(\mathbf{I}-\rho\mathbf{D}\right)^{-1}\right),   (\#eq:3)$$

where $s$ represents a location identified by the coordinates
$\left(x\left(s\right),y\left(s\right)\right)$, $\mathbf{\beta}$ is a
vector of fixed effects, $\mathbf{X}_s$ is the fixed-effect design
matrix for location $s$, $u_s$ is the location-specific random effects
and $\mathbf{Z}_s$ is a design matrix associated with $u_s$. While

$$\label{eq:3b} 
\mathbf{u} = \left(u_1 , u_2 , \dots , u_n\right)^{T} \sim N\left(\mathbf{0}, \Sigma = \tau\left(\mathbf{I}-\rho\mathbf{D}\right)^{-1}\left(\mathbf{I}-\rho\mathbf{D}^{T}\right)^{-1}\right)   (\#eq:3b)$$

gives a Gaussian SAR random effects structure. The $\mathbf{D}$ matrix
in Equations (\@ref(eq:3)) and (\@ref(eq:3b)) is some known function of
the location coordinates [see, e.g., @Clayton] and $\rho$ is often
referred to as the spatial dependence parameter [@Hodges]. In
application, $\mathbf{D}$ is often a neighborhood matrix whose diagonal
elements are all 0, and off-diagonal elements $\left(s, t\right)$ are 1
if locations $s$ and $t$ are neighbors.

If $\mathbf{\Sigma}=\tau \mathbf{I}$, i.e., there is no spatial
correlation, then this model may be estimated by using usual software
packages for GLMMs. With $\mathbf{\Sigma}=\tau \mathbf{D}$, i.e.,
defining the spatial correlation directly via the $\mathbf{D}$ matrix,
the model can be fitted using earlier versions of the *hglm* package.
However, for the general structure in Equations (\@ref(eq:3)) and
(\@ref(eq:3b)), estimation using explicit maximization of the marginal
or profile likelihood involves quite advanced derivations as a
consequence of partial differentiation of the likelihood including
$\mathbf{\Sigma}$ with $\rho$ and $\tau$ as parameters [see, e.g.,
@Lee2012]. In this paper, we show that by using eigen decomposition of
$\mathbf{\Sigma}$, we can modify an already existing R package, e.g.,
*hglm*, with minor programming effort, to fit a HGLM with CAR or SAR
random effects.

# h-likelihood estimation

In order to explain the specific model fitting algorithm implemented in
*hglm*, we present a brief overview of the EQL algorithm for HGLMs
[@LeeNelder96]. First, we start with the standard HGLM containing only
uncorrelated random effects. Then, we extend the discussion for CAR and
SAR random effects. Though it is possible to have more than one
random-effect term, in a HGLM, coming from different distributions among
the conjugate distributions to GLM families, for presentational
simplicity we consider only one random-effect in this section. The
(log-)h-likelihood for a HGLM with independent random effects can be
presented as

$$\label{eq:3c} 
h = \sum_i\sum_j \left( \frac{\left( y_{i,j} \theta_{i,j} - b\left( \theta_{i,j} \right) \right)}{\phi} +c\left( y_{i,j},\phi \right) \right)+ \sum_i\left( \frac{\psi v_i - b_R \left(  v_i \right)}{\tau} +c_R\left(\tau \right) \right),   (\#eq:3c)$$

where, $i = 1, 2, \dots, n$, $j=1,2,\dots k$, $\theta$ is the canonical
parameter of the mean model, $\phi$ is the dispersion parameter of th
mean model, $b\left(. \right)$ a function which satisfies
$E\left( y_{i,j}|u_i \right)=\mu_{i,j}=b'\left( \theta_{i,j} \right)$
and
$Var\left( y_{i,j}|u_i \right)=\phi b''\left( \theta_{i,j} \right) = \phi V\left( \mu_{i,j} \right)$,
where $V(.)$ is the GLM variance function. Furthermore, $\phi$ is the
dispersion parameter of the mean model, $\theta_R\left( u_i \right)=v_i$
with $\theta_R\left( . \right)$ being a so-called weak canonical link
for $u_i$ (leading to conjugate HGLMs) or an identity link for Gaussian
random effects leading to GLMMs [@LN06 pp. 3--4],
$\psi = E\left( u_i \right)$, $\tau$ is the dispersion parameter, and
$b_R$ and $c_R$ are some known functions depending on the distribution
of $u_i$. Equation (\@ref(eq:3c)) also implies that $h$ can be defined
uniquely by using the means and the mean-variance relations of
$y_{i,j}|u_i$ and the quasi-response $\psi$, allowing us representing it
as a sum of two extended quasi-likelihoods [double EQL; @LN03] as

$$\label{eq:3d}  
-2D = \sum_i\sum_j \left( \frac{d_{0,i,j}}{\phi} + \log\left( 2\pi \phi V\left( y_{i,j}|u_i\right)\right)\right) + \sum_i \left( \frac{d_{1,i}}{\tau}+ \log\left( 2\pi\tau V_1\left( u_i\right)\right)\right),   (\#eq:3d)$$

where $d_{0,i,j}$ and $d_{1,i}$ are the deviance components of
$y_{i,j}|u_i$ and $\psi$ respectively and
$Var\left( \psi \right)= \tau V_1\left( u_i\right)$. It is worth noting
that $-2D$ is an approximation to $h$ if $y|u$ or $u$ (or both)
belongs/belong to Binomial, Poisson, double-Poisson (or quasi-Poisson),
Beta, or Gamma families. However, no such equivalent relation (even
approximately) is known for the quasi-Binomial family.

In order to estimate the model parameters, [@LeeNelder96] suggested a
two-step procedure in which the first, for fixed dispersion parameters
$\phi$ and $\tau$, $h$ (or equivalently $-2D$) is maximized w.r.t.
$\mathbf{\beta}$ and $\mathbf{v}=\lbrace v_i \rbrace$. This maximization
leads to an iteratively weighted least-square (IWLS) algorithm which
solves
$$\mathbf{T}_{a}^{\prime}\mathbf{\Sigma}^{-1}\mathbf{T}_{a}\boldsymbol{\delta}=\mathbf{T}_{a}^{\prime}\mathbf{\Sigma}^{-1}\mathbf{y}_{a},$$
where $\mathbf{T}_{a}=\begin{pmatrix}
\mathbf{X} & \mathbf{Z}\\
\mathbf{0} & \mathbf{I}_{n}\end{pmatrix}$,
$\boldsymbol{\delta} = \begin{pmatrix} \mathbf{\beta} \\ \mathbf{v} \end{pmatrix}$,
$\mathbf{y_a}= \begin{pmatrix}
\mathbf{y}_{0,a}\\ \mathbf{y}_{1,a} \end{pmatrix}$ with
$\mathbf{y}_{0,a}=\left\lbrace \eta_{i,j} -\left( y_{i,j} - \mu_{i,j}\right)\frac{\partial \eta_{i,j}}{\partial \mu_{i,j}}\right\rbrace$
and
$\mathbf{y}_{1,a}=\left \lbrace v_i - \left( \psi_i - u_i\right) \frac{\partial v_i}{\partial u_i}\right \rbrace$
are the vectors of GLM working responses for $y_{i,j}|u_i$ and $v_i$
respectively, and $\mathbf{\Sigma} = \mathcal{I}\mathbf{W}^{-1}$ with
$\mathcal{I}$ being a diagonal matrix whose first $n$ diagonal elements
are all equal to $\phi$ and the remaining $k$ diagonal elements are all
equal to $\tau$ and
$\mathbf{W}=\text{diag}\left( \mathbf{w}_{0},\mathbf{w}_1 \right)$ where
$\mathbf{w}_0 = \left\lbrace \left( \frac{\partial \mu_{i,j}}{\partial \eta_{i,j}} \right)^2 \frac{1}{V\left( \mu_{i,j}\right)} \right\rbrace$
and
$\mathbf{w}_1= \left\lbrace \left(\frac{\partial u_i}{\partial v_i}\right)^2 \frac{1}{V_1\left(u_i \right)} \right\rbrace$.

In the second step, the following profile likelihood is maximized to
estimate the dispersion parameters.

$$\label{eq:3e} 
p_{\mathbf{\beta}, \mathbf{v}} \left( h \right) = \left( h - \frac{1}{2} \left|\frac{\partial^2 h}{\partial\left(\mathbf{\beta},\mathbf{v}\right) \partial\left(\mathbf{\beta},\mathbf{v}\right)^T } \right|\right)_{\mathbf{\beta}=\hat{\mathbf{\beta}}, \mathbf{v} = \hat{\mathbf{v}}},   (\#eq:3e)$$

where $\hat{\mathbf{\beta}}$ and $\hat{\mathbf{v}}$ are obtained from
the fist step. One needs to iterate between the two steps until
convergence. This procedure is often referred to as "HL(0,1)" [@Lee2012]
and is available in the R packages *spaMM* and
[*HGLMMM*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=HGLMMM) [@hglmmm]. Because
there is no unified algorithm to maximize
$p_{\mathbf{\beta}, \mathbf{v}}$ computer packages often carry out the
maximization by using general purpose optimization routines, e.g.,
package *spaMM* uses the `optim` function.

A unified algorithm for estimating the variance components can be
derived by using profile likelihood adjustment in
Equation (\@ref(eq:3d)) instead of (\@ref(eq:3c)). This leads to
maximizing

$$\label{eq:3f}  
p_{\mathbf{\beta}, \mathbf{v}} \left( Q \right) = \left( -2D - \frac{1}{2} \left|\frac{\partial^2 \left(-2D\right)}{\partial\left(\mathbf{\beta},\mathbf{v}\right) \partial\left(\mathbf{\beta},\mathbf{v}\right)^T } \right|\right)_{\mathbf{\beta}=\hat{\mathbf{\beta}}, \mathbf{v} = \hat{\mathbf{v}}}   (\#eq:3f)$$

for estimating $\tau$ and $\phi$. The corresponding score equation of
the dispersion parameters, after ignoring the fact that
$\hat{\mathbf{\beta}}$ and $\hat{\mathbf{v}}$ are functions of $\phi$
and $\tau$, can be shown [see, e.g., @LN01] to have the form of Gamma
family GLMs with $d_{0,i,j}/\left( 1-h_{i,j} \right)$ and
$d_{1,i}/\left( 1-h_{i} \right)$ as the responses for $\phi$ and $\tau$
respectively, where $h_{i,j}$ and $h_i$ are the hat values corresponding
to $y_{i,j}$ and $v_i$ in the first step, and
$\left( 1-h_{i,j} \right)/2$ and $\left( 1-h_{i} \right)/2$ as the
respective prior weights. This procedure is often referred to as EQL
[@LN06] or DEQL [@LN03] and was the only available procedure in *hglm*
($\leqslant$ 1.2-8). An advantage of this algorithm is that fixed
effects can also be fitted in the dispersion parameters [@LN06] without
requiring any major change in the algorithm.

HL(0,1) and EQL were found to be biased, especially for binary responses
when the cluster size is small [@LN01; @Noh07] and when $\tau$ is large
in both Binomial and Poisson GLMMs. Several adjustments are suggested
and explained in the literature [see, e.g., @LN01; @LN03; @Lee2012] to
improve the performance of h-likelihood estimation. Among these
alternative suggestions HL(1,1) is the most easily implementable and
found to be computationally faster than the other alternatives
[@Lee2012]. The HL(1,1) estimates the fixed effects, $\mathbf{\beta}$,
by maximizing $p_{\mathbf{v}}\left( h \right)$ instead of $h$ and can be
implemented by adjusting the working response $\mathbf{y}_a$ in the IWLS
step, according to @Lee2012. In *hglm* ($\geqslant$ 2.0), this
correction for the $\mathbf{\beta}$ estimates has been implemented,
through the `method = "EQL1"` option, but still
$p_{\mathbf{\beta}, \mathbf{v}} \left( Q \right)$ is maximized for the
estimation of the dispersion parameters, in order to make use of the
unified algorithm for dispersion parameter estimates via Gamma GLMs.
Table [1](#Table3) shows available options for h-likelihood estimation
(subject to the corrections mentioned above) in different R packages.

$^{\text{a}}$ By specifying `method = "EQL1"` in the *hglm* package, the
HL(1,1) correction of the working response is applied in the EQL
algorithm.
:::

The above EQL method cannot be directly applied to HGLMs with CAR/SAR
random effects because the resulting
$p_{\mathbf{\beta}, \mathbf{v}} \left( Q \right)$ does not allow us to
use the Gamma GLM to estimate the dispersion parameters, $\tau$ and
$\rho$. In the following subsection we present a simplification which
allows us to use the Gamma GLM for estimating $\tau$ and $\rho$.

## Simplification of model computation {#Sec:CARRepara}

The main difference between an ordinary GLMM with independent random
effects and CAR/SAR random effects models is that the random effects in
the later cases are not independent. In the following we show that by
using the eigen decomposition we can reformulate a GLMM with CAR or SAR
random effects to an equivalent GLMM with independent but
heteroscedastic random effects.

Lemma 1

:   Let $\mathbf{\omega} = \{\omega_i\}_{i=1}^{n}$ be the eigenvalues of
    $\mathbf{D}$, and $\mathbf{V}$ is the matrix whose columns are the
    corresponding orthonormal eigenvectors, then

    $$\label{eq:4} 
     \frac{1}{\tau} ( \mathbf{I} - \rho \mathbf{D} ) = \mathbf{V} \mathbf{\Lambda} \mathbf{V}^{T},   (\#eq:4)$$
    where $\mathbf{\Lambda}$ is diagonal matrix whose $i$th diagonal
    element is given by

    $$\lambda_i = \frac{1-\rho \omega_i}{\tau}.$$

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```

Proof of Lemma 1

:   
    $$\begin{aligned}
      & \mathbf{V} \mathbf{\Lambda} \mathbf{V}^{T} \quad && = \quad && \mathbf{V}\text{diag}\left\lbrace \frac{1-\rho \omega_i}{\tau} \right \rbrace \mathbf{V}^{T} \nonumber\\
      &\quad && = \quad && \frac{1}{\tau} ( \mathbf{V}  \mathbf{V}^{T} - \rho \mathbf{V} \text{diag}\{ \omega_i \} \mathbf{V}^{T} ) \nonumber\\
      &\quad && = \quad &&  \frac{1}{\tau} ( \mathbf{I} - \rho \mathbf{D} )
    \end{aligned}$$

It is worth noting that the relation between the eigenvalues of
$\mathbf{D}$ and $\mathbf{\Sigma}$ was already known as early as in
@Ord1975 and was used to simplify the likelihood function of the
Gaussian CAR model. Similarly, for simplification of the SAR model, we
have
$$\frac{1}{\tau} ( \mathbf{I} - \rho \mathbf{D} )( \mathbf{I} - \rho \mathbf{D}^{T} ) = \mathbf{V} \text{diag}\left\{ \frac{(1-\rho \omega_i)^{2}}{\tau}\right\} \mathbf{V}^{T}.$$
An anonymous referee has pointed out that a somewhat extended version of
**Lemma 1**, which deals with simultaneous diagonalization of two
positive semi-definite matrices [@Newcomb], has already been used to
simplify the computation of Gaussian response models with intrinsic CAR
random effects, especially in a Bayesian context [see, e.g., @He and the
related discussions in @Hodges, Chap. 5]. Therefore, **Lemma 1** is not
an original contribution of this paper, however, to the authors'
knowledge, no software package has yet utilized this convenient
relationship to fit any HGLM by using interconnected GLMs, as discussed
below.

Re-arranging Equation (\@ref(eq:1)), we have

$$\label{eq:5}
\mathbf{\eta} = \mathbf{X} \mathbf{\mathbf{\beta}} + \tilde{\mathbf{Z}} \mathbf{u}^{\ast},   (\#eq:5)$$

where, $\mathbf{\eta} = \left\lbrace \eta_s \right\rbrace$,
$\mathbf{X} = \left\lbrace \mathbf{X}_s \right\rbrace$,
$\tilde{\mathbf{Z}} = \left\lbrace  \mathbf{Z}_s \right\rbrace \mathbf{V}$
and $\mathbf{u}^{\ast} = \mathbf{V}^{T} \mathbf{u}$. With the virtue of
**Lemma 1** and the properties of the multivariate normal distribution,
we see that
$\mathbf{u}^{\ast} \sim N\left(\mathbf{0}, \mathbf{\Lambda}^{-1}\right)$.
This model can now easily be fitted using the *hglm* package in
[R]{.sans-serif}. Further note that, for the CAR model, from **Lemma
1**, we have

$$\begin{aligned}
\label{eq:6a}
 & \lambda_i \quad && = && \quad \frac{1-\rho \omega_i}{\tau} \nonumber \\ 
 &\quad && = \quad && \quad \theta_0 + \theta_1 \omega_i  
\end{aligned}   (\#eq:6a)$$

where $\theta_0 = 1/\tau$ and $\theta_1 = - \rho/\tau$. While for the
SAR model,

$$\begin{aligned}
\label{eq:6b}
 &\quad && \lambda_i \quad && =  && \quad \frac{(1-\rho \omega_i)^{2}}{\tau} \nonumber \\ 
&\Rightarrow \quad && \sqrt{\lambda_{i}} \quad && =  && \quad \theta_0 + \theta_1 \omega_i,  
\end{aligned}   (\#eq:6b)$$

where $\theta_0 = 1/\sqrt{\tau}$ and $\theta_1 = - \rho/\sqrt{\tau}$.
[Following [@LN06], we can use an inverse link for CAR or an inverse
square-root link for SAR in a Gamma GLM with response
${u_i}^{*2}/\left( 1- h_i\right)$, where $h_i$ is the corresponding hat
value from the mean model (Equation (\@ref(eq:5))),
$\left( 1-h_i\right)/2$ as the weight and the linear predictor given by
Equations (\@ref(eq:6a)) and (\@ref(eq:6b)) to obtain an EQL estimate of
$\theta_0$ and $\theta_1$]{style="color: black"}.

# Implementation

The spatial models above are implemented in the *hglm* package
($\geqslant2.0$) by defining new families, `CAR()` and `SAR()`, for the
random effects. The "CAR" and "SAR" families allow the user to define
spatial structures by specifying the $\mathbf{D}$ matrix. Using **Lemma
1**, these families are created using $\mathbf{D}$ with default link
function "identity" for the Gaussian random effects $\mathbf{u}$, and
"inverse" and "inverse.sqrt" for the dispersion models (\@ref(eq:6a))
and (\@ref(eq:6b)). When the "CAR" or "SAR" family is specified for the
random effects, the parameter estimates $\hat{\rho}$ and $\hat{\tau}$
are given in the output in addition to the other summary statistics of
the dispersion models. The new input options in *hglm* are described in
Table [2](#Table1).

Throughout the examples below, we use Gaussian CAR random effects to
introduce spatial correlation. However, one can also add additional
independent non-Gaussian random effects along with the Gaussian CAR
random effect. For example, an overdispersed count response can be
fitted using a Poisson HGLM with an independent Gamma and Gaussian CAR
random effects.

# Examples and simulation study

In the *hglm* package vignette, we look at the improvement of EQL1 in
comparison to EQL. Here, we focus on the precision of the parameter
estimates with spatial HGLMs.

## Poisson CAR & SAR model

We study the properties of the estimates produced by *hglm* using a
simulation study built around the Scottish Lip Cancer example (see also
the examples). We simulate data with the same $\mathbf{X}$ values,
offset and neighborhood matrix as in the Scottish Lip Cancer example
data. We use the true values of the parameters, after @Lee2012, as
$\left(\text{intercept}, \mathbf{\beta}_{fpp}, \tau, \rho \right) = \left(
  0.25, 0.35, 1.5, 0.1 \right)$. The parameter estimates for 1000 Monte
Carlo iterations are summarized in Table [3](#Table2).

  : Table 3: Average bias in parameter estimates in the simulation using
  the Scottish Lip Cancer example.
:::

Both the EQL and the EQL1 correction are slightly biased for $\tau$ and
$\rho$ (Table [3](#Table2)) though the absolute amount of bias is small
and may be negligible in practical applications. The EQL1 correction
mainly improves the estimates of the intercept term. There were
convergence problems for a small number of replicates, which was not
surprising given the small number of observations ($n=56$) and that the
simulated value for the spatial autocorrelation parameter $\rho$
connects the effects in the different Scottish districts rather weakly.
Such convergence problems can be addressed by pre-specifying better
starting values. For the converged estimates the bias was small and
negligible.

![Figure 1: Density plot of the spatial variance-covariance parameter
estimates from CAR models via `"EQL1"` over 1000 Monte Carlo simulations
for the Scottish Lip Cancer example.](new_density_plots.png){#Fig1
width="100%" alt="graphic without alt text"}

The simulation results also revealed that the distribution of
$\hat{\rho}$ from CAR models is skewed (see Figure [1](#Fig1)), which
was also pointed out by @Lee2012. However, the distribution of
$-\hat{\rho}/\hat{\tau}$ turned out to be less skewed than the
distribution of $\hat{\rho}$. Similar observation was also found for SAR
models. This suggests, we might draw any inference on spatial
variance-covariance parameters in the transformed scale, $\theta_0$ and
$\theta_1$.

## Computational efficiency

Fitting CAR and SAR models for large data sets could be computationally
challenging, especially for the spatial variance-covariance parameters.
Using our new algorithm in *hglm*, moderately sized problems can be
fitted efficiently.

We re-sampled from the `ohio` data set (for more details on the data set
see also the examples) for different number of locations, each with 10
replicates, executed on a single Intel©Xeon©E5520 2.27GHz CPU. In each
replicate, the data was fitted using both *hglm* and *spaMM*, for the
same model described above. The results regarding average computational
time are summarized in Figure [2](#Fig2). *hglm* is clearly more usable
for fitting larger sized data sets. In the package vignette, we also
show the comparisons of the parameter estimates, where the `"EQL"`
estimates from *hglm* are almost identical to the `"EQL-"` estimates
from *spaMM*, with high correlation coefficients between the two
methods: 1.0000, 0.9998, 0.9997 and 0.9999 for the residual variance,
$\rho$, $\tau$ and the intercept, respectively.

## Examples

### Scottish Lip Cancer data set {#ExLipCancer}

Here we analyze the `cancer` data set [source: @Clayton] from the *hglm*
package. Calling `data(cancer)` loads a numeric vector `E` that
represents the expected number of skin cancer patients in different
districts in Scotland, a numeric vector `O` giving the corresponding
observed counts, a numeric vector `Paff` giving proportion of people
involved agriculture, farming, and fisheries, and matrix `D` giving the
neighborhood structure among Scottish districts. Here we demonstrate how
the data is fitted as a CAR model or a SAR model, using the *hglm*
package with the EQL method.

``` r
> library(hglm)
> data(cancer)
> logE <- log(E)
> XX <- model.matrix(~ Paff)
> cancerCAR <- hglm(X = XX, y = O, Z = diag(56), 
+                   family = poisson(), 
+                   rand.family = CAR(D = nbr),
+                   offset = logE, conv = 1e-8, 
+                   maxit = 200, fix.disp = 1)
> summary(cancerCAR)
```

``` r

hglm.default(X = XX, y = O, Z = diag(56), family = poisson(), 
    rand.family = CAR(D = nbr), conv = 1e-08, fix.disp = 1, offset = logE)

In the above output provided by the `summary()` method, fixed effects
estimates are given under `MEAN MODEL`, and the dispersion parameter
estimates are given under `DISPERSION MODEL`. Here, we have only one
random effects term that has a CAR structure, and the corresponding
parameter estimates, $\hat{\theta}_0=6.487$ and $\hat{\theta}_1=-1.129$,
are given under `.|Random1`. However, these are not the natural
parameters of the CAR model (see Section [3.1](#Sec:CARRepara))
therefore the estimates of the natural dispersion parameters are given
just after them which are, in this case, $\hat{\tau}=0.15$ and
$\hat{\rho} = 0.17$. Because the $\mathbf{D}$ matrix was a neighborhood
matrix (consisting of 0's and 1's), the results imply that the partial
correlation of the random effect for any two neighboring districts,
given the same for all other districts, is 0.17.

Furthermore, the value 656.3 for the dispersion of the random effects
given in the output above is an overall variance of $\mathbf{u}^{\ast}$
in Equation (\@ref(eq:5)). This output is usually not of interest to the
user and the main results are contained in $\hat{\tau}$ and
$\hat{\rho}$.

For the CAR model, the `hglm` estimates are exactly the same as those
labelled as "PQL" estimates in @Lee2012. To get the EQL1 correction the
user has to add the option `method = "EQL1"` and the `hglm` function
gives similar results to those reported in @Lee2012, e.g., their HL(1,1)
estimates were
$\left(\text{intercept}, \mathbf{\beta}_{fpp}, \tau, \rho\right) = \left(0.238, 0.0376, 0.155, 0.174\right)$
whereas our `"EQL1"` correction gives (0.234, 0.0377, 0.156, 0.174) (see
also Section "Fitting a spatial Markov Random Field model using the CAR
family" in the package vignette). A minor difference to the `"EQL1"`
result appears because @Lee2012 used the HL(1,1) modification to their
HL(0,1) whereas we apply such a correction directly to EQL which is
slightly different from HL(0,1) (see Table [1](#Table3)).

### Ohio elementary school grades data set

We analyze a data set consisting of the student grades of 1,967 Ohio
Elementary Schools during the year 2001--2002. The data set is freely
available on the internet (URL <http://www.spatial-econometrics.com/>)
as a web supplement to @LeSage but was not analyzed therein. The shape
files were downloaded from
<http://www.census.gov/cgi-bin/geo/shapefiles2013/main> and the
districts of 1,860 schools in these two files could be connected
unambiguously. The data set contains information on, for instance,
school building ID, Zip code of the location of the school, proportion
of passing on five subjects, number of teachers, number of students,
etc. We regress the median of 4th grade proficiency scores,
$\mathbf{y}$, on an intercept, based on school districts. The
statistical model is given as

$$\label{eq:7} 
y_{i,j}=\mu + v_{j} + \epsilon_{i,j},   (\#eq:7)$$

where $i=1,2,\dots,1860$ (observations), $j=1,2,\dots,616$ (districts),
$\epsilon_{i,j} \sim N \left( 0, \sigma_{e}^2\right)$,
$\{ v_j \} =\mathbf{v} \sim N \left( \mathbf{0}, \tau \left( \mathbf{I} - \rho \mathbf{W}\right)^{-1} \right)$
and $\mathbf{W}= \{w_{p,q} \}_{p,q=1}^{616}$ is a spatial weight matrix
(i.e., the neighborhood matrix). We construct $w_{p,q}=1$ if the two
districts $p$ and $q$ are adjacent, and $w_{p,q}=0$ otherwise.

The above choice of constructing the weight matrix is rather simple.
Because the aim of this paper is to demonstrate the use of *hglm* for
fitting spatial models rather than drawing conclusions from real data
analysis, we skip any further discussion on the construction of the
weight matrix. Interested, readers are referred to @LeSage for more
discussion on the construction of the spatial weight matrices. With the
spatial weight matrix defined as above, we can estimate model
(\@ref(eq:7)) by using our *hglm* package in the following way.

``` r
> ## load the data object 'ohio'
> data(ohio)
>
> ## fit a CAR model for the median scores of the districts
> X <- model.matrix(MedianScore ~ 1, data = ohioMedian)
> Z <- model.matrix(~ 0 + district, data = ohioMedian)
> ohioCAR <- hglm(y = ohioMedian$MedianScore, X = X, Z = Z, 
+                 rand.family = CAR(D = ohioDistrictDistMat))
> summary(ohioCAR)

The estimated spatial correlation parameter among school districts is
0.109. We can obtain fitted values from the CAR model and predict the
school districts without any observations. The following codes perform
such prediction and the results are visualized in Figure [3](#Fig3)(B).
We remove the estimate of Lake Erie, as estimation for an uninhabited
region is meaningless.

```

A `predict()` method is not available because predicting spatially
correlated random effects for autoregressive models requires re-fitting
the whole model. Thus standard kriging cannot be used because the
covariance structure changes if the neighborhood matrix is altered,
while keeping $\tau$ and $\rho$ unchanged. Instead, the fitted model
needs to include the entire neighborhood matrix with districts having
missing data as well. Consequently, the incidence matrix $\mathbf{Z}$
has more columns than rows. This method of predicting random effects is
frequently used in animal breeding applications [@Henderson84] but, to
our knowledge, has not been applied to spatial autoregressive models
previously.

In the example above, `ohioMedian$district` has 616 levels and 54 of the
districts have no records (Figure  [3](#Fig3)(A)). The incidence matrix
`Z`, created using the `model.matrix` function, therefore has 616
columns and 54 of these are columns of zeros. Hence, there are 616
levels in the fitted spatial random effect giving predictions for the
districts without records.

# Conclusion

The *hglm* package is one of few non-Bayesian packages on CRAN to fit
spatial HGLMs, where the fixed and random effects are estimated
simultaneously. We have shown how the HGLM framework, allowing linear
predictors to model variance components, can be exploited to fit CAR and
SAR models. This gives a computationally efficient algorithm for
moderately sized problems (number of locations $<$ approx. $5000$).
