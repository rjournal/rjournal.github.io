title: 'pdp: An R Package for Constructing Partial Dependence Plots'
abstract: Complex nonparametric models—like neural networks, random forests, and support
  vector machines—are more common than ever in predictive analytics, especially when
  dealing with large observational databases that don’t adhere to the strict assumptions
  imposed by traditional statistical techniques (e.g., multiple linear regression
  which assumes linearity, homoscedasticity, and normality). Unfortunately, it can
  be challenging to understand the results of such models and explain them to management.
  Partial dependence plots offer a simple solution. Partial dependence plots are low
  dimensional graphical renderings of the prediction function so that the relationship
  between the outcome and predictors of interest can be more easily understood. These
  plots are especially useful in explaining the output from black box models. In this
  paper, we introduce pdp, a general R package for constructing partial dependence
  plots.
