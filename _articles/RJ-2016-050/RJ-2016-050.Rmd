title: 'comf: An R Package for Thermal Comfort Studies'
abstract: The field of thermal comfort generated a number of thermal comfort indices.
  Their code implementation needs to be done by individual researchers. This paper
  presents the R package, comf, which includes functions for common and new thermal
  comfort indices. Additional functions allow comparisons between the predictive performance
  of these indices. This paper reviews existing thermal comfort indices and available
  code implementations. This is followed by the description of the R package and an
  example how to use the R package for the comparison of different thermal comfort
  indices on data from a thermal comfort study.
