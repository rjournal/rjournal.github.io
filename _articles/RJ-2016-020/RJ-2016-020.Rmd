title: Crowdsourced Data Preprocessing with R and Amazon Mechanical Turk
abstract: This article introduces the use of the Amazon Mechanical Turk (MTurk) crowdsourcing
  platform as a resource for R users to leverage crowdsourced human intelligence for
  preprocessing “messy” data into a form easily analyzed within R. The article first
  describes MTurk and the MTurkR package, then outlines how to use MTurkR to gather
  and manage crowdsourced data with MTurk using some of the package’s core functionality.
  Potential applications of MTurkR include construction of manually coded training
  sets, human transcription and translation, manual data scraping from scanned documents,
  content analysis, image classification, and the completion of online survey questionnaires,
  among others. As an example of massive data preprocessing, the article describes
  an image rating task involving 225 crowdsourced workers and more than 5500 images
  using just three MTurkR function calls.
