title: Crowdsourced Data Preprocessing with R and Amazon Mechanical Turk
abstract: This article introduces the use of the Amazon Mechanical Turk (MTurk) crowdsourcing
  platform as a resource for R users to leverage crowdsourced human intelligence for
  preprocessing "messy" data into a form easily analyzed within R. The article first
  describes MTurk and the *MTurkR* package, then outlines how to use *MTurkR* to gather
  and manage crowdsourced data with MTurk using some of the package's core functionality.
  Potential applications of *MTurkR* include construction of manually coded training
  sets, human transcription and translation, manual data scraping from scanned documents,
  content analysis, image classification, and the completion of online survey questionnaires,
  among others. As an example of massive data preprocessing, the article describes
  an image rating task involving 225 crowdsourced workers and more than 5500 images
  using just three *MTurkR* function calls.

# Introduction

Often people use R because it is extensible, robust, and free. It can do
many things, but doing those many things generally requires data
structures that can be handled computationally. Yet sometimes R users
are faced with messy data that are not "R-ready." Examples include: when
working with handwritten survey responses, digitized texts that cannot
be read by optical character recognition, images, etc. Other times an
analyst may face machine-readable data that requires human
interpretation to categorize, translate, or code the data, e.g., someone
wishing to build an automated classifier needs a human-categorized
training set to test their implementation.

In such cases, making the leap from these raw data to R data structures
can entail considerable human labor. Such needs for human labor in data
preprocessing has provoked interest in online crowdsourcing platforms
[@Schmidt2010; @ChenMenezesBradley2011] to bring human intelligence to
tasks that cannot be easily accomplished through computation alone. This
paper describes the use of
[*MTurkR*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=MTurkR) [@Leeper2012c] to
leverage the Amazon Mechanical Turk (MTurk) crowdsourcing platform to
bring human intelligence into R. The article begins by laying out the
need for occasional human intelligence in data preprocessing, then
describes MTurk and its vocabulary, and introduces *MTurkR*.

# The need for human intelligence

Some data cannot be computationally preprocessed. Other data can be
handled computationally only with difficulty. In these cases, data
preprocessing can be a time consuming and expensive task because of the
human intelligence required. Archetypal needs for this kind of human
intelligence include the collection of data which cannot be automated
(e.g., unstructured or malformed web data), transcription of files into
machine-readable data (e.g., audio, images, or handwritten documents
scanned as PDFs), tasks that are laborious to translate from an
R-readable but non-computable data structure into a format that can be
readily analyzed (e.g., text answers to free-response survey questions),
or massive-scale machine readable data that require human interpretation
(e.g., the data used in generating a training set for supervised
learning algorithms).

Due to the manual nature of these tasks, preprocessing such data can
become challenging, especially as the size of the dataset increases.
Crowdsourcing these data preprocessing needs is therefore one way to
obtain the scalable human intelligence needed to preprocess even very
large "messy" datasets. As opposed to an analyst engaged in manual
preprocessing, crowdsourcing offers the possibility to leverage multiple
sources of human intelligence, in parallel, thereby improving
reliability and speed. Amazon Mechanical Turk (MTurk) stands out as one
of the largest crowdsourcing platforms currently available and, its
powerful API is now accessible directly in R through *MTurkR*.

# MTurk core concepts

Amazon Mechanical Turk is a crowdsourcing platform designed by Amazon as
part of its suite of Amazon Web Service (AWS) tools to provide human
intelligence for tasks that cannot be readily, affordably, or feasibly
automated [@Amazon2012]. Because MTurk provides the web application for
recruiting, paying, and managing human workers, the effort necessary to
move a data cleaning task into the cloud is relatively effortless and,
with *MTurkR*, can, in large part, be managed directly in R. While many
early adopters of MTurk as a data generation tool have come from
computer science [@MasonSuri2011; @KitturChiSuh2008], more recent
attention has also emerged in the social sciences where MTurk's pool of
workers are seen as a low-cost participant pool for human subjects
research
[@BuhrmesterKwangGosling2011; @BerinskyHuberLenz2010; @PaolacciChandlerStern2010].
This article provides a sufficiently general overview of MTurk and
*MTurkR* to enable its use for a variety of purposes, but focuses
primarily on the uses of MTurk for data preprocessing.[^1]

## Key terms

MTurk connects requesters, who are willing to pay workers to perform a
given task or set of tasks at a specified price per task. These "Human
Intelligence Tasks" (HITs), are the core element of the MTurk platform.
A HIT is a task that a requester would like one or more workers to
perform. Every HIT is automatically assigned a unique HITId to identify
this HIT in the system. Performance of that HIT by one worker is called
an assignment, indexed by a unique AssignmentId, such that a given
worker can only complete one assignment per HIT but multiple workers can
each complete an assignment for each HIT. As a simple example, if a HIT
is a PDF file to be transcribed, the researcher might want three workers
to complete the transcription in order to validate the effort and
therefore make three assignments available for this HIT.

In other situations, however, a researcher may want workers to complete
a set of related tasks. For example, the researcher may want to
categorize 5000 text statements such as free response answers to a
survey question into a set of fixed categories. Each of these statements
could be treated as a separate HIT, grouped as a HITType with one (or
more) assignment(s) available for each HIT. While a worker could
complete all 5000 assignments they might also code fewer (e.g., 50
statements), thereby leaving 4950 assignments for other workers to
claim.

Workers choose which HITs to complete and how many HITs they want to
complete at any given time, depending on their own time, interests, and
the payments that requesters offer in exchange for completing an
assignment for a given HIT.[^2] A requester can offer as low as \$0.005
per assignment. Similarly, requesters can pay any higher amount, but
that may not be cost-effective given the market forces in play on MTurk.
Workers increasingly expect competitive wages, at a rate of at least
U.S. minimum hourly wage.

Once a worker completes a HIT, the requester can review the assignment
-- that is, see the responses provided by the worker to the HIT -- and
the requester can either approve (and thus pay the worker the pre-agreed
"reward" amount) or reject (and not pay the worker).[^3] This review
process can be relatively automated or handled manually by the
requester.

The MTurk system records all workers that have ever performed work for a
given requester and provides an array of functionality for tracking,
organizing, paying, and corresponding with workers. In particular, the
system allows requesters to regulate who can complete HITs through the
use of QualificationRequirements (e.g., a worker's previous HIT approval
rate, their country of residence, or a requester-defined qualification
such as past performance or previously evaluated skills).

## Sandbox environment

One final point is that MTurk has both a "live" website and development
sandbox, where the service can be tested without transacting any money.
The sandbox can be a useful place to create and test HITs before making
them available for workers. Note, however, that the two systems --
despite operating with identical code -- have separate databases of
HITs, HITTypes, qualifications, workers, and assignments so code may not
directly translate between sandbox and the live server.

## MTurk API and other packages

Amazon provides software development kits for Python, Ruby, etc. as well
as a rudimentary command-line utility, but no officially supported
client for R. The *MTurkR* package fills this gap, enabling R users to
fully manage an MTurk workflow, from submitting "messy" data to MTurk,
reviewing work completed by workers, and retrieving completed work as an
R data frame.[^4]

# The *MTurkR* package

Before using MTurk, a MTurk requester account is necessary. These which
can be created at <http://www.mturk.com>.[^5] It is also helpful from a
practical perspective to have a worker account, so that you can test
your own HITs interactively and have the requester-worker relationship
necessary to test some MTurk features (e.g., contacting workers or
setting up qualifications). *MTurkR*'s access to the MTurk API requires
Amazon Access Keys, which can be setup at
<https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/home?#security_credential>. The
keypair is a linked Access Key ID and a Secret Access Key.

*MTurkR* is implemented in a functional programming style, with the core
functionality enabling the creation of HITs and retrieval of resulting
assignment data. All of this functionality is described here, as well as
in detailed examples in the *MTurkR* package documentation
[@Leeper2012c]. As a web API client, the package provides a complete
wrapper for all API features using function names closely mapped onto
API endpoints, making it easy to cross-reference MTurk API documentation
with *MTurkR* functionality. *MTurkR* performs HTTP requests to the
MTurk API using [*curl*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=curl)
[@Ooms2015] and parses responses using
[*XML*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=XML) [@TempleLang2012b]. In
almost all cases, responses are converted into data frames. In the event
an API request fails, error reporting information is returned instead of
the standard data structure.[^6]

A simple "hello world!" test in *MTurkR* can be performed by checking
the balance in a requester's account. To do so, the AWS credentials are
set as environment variables:

``` r
Sys.setenv("AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID" = "AWSAccessKeyId")
Sys.setenv("AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY" = "AWSSecretAccessKey")

# Test connection to live server
AccountBalance()

# Test connection to sandbox server
AccountBalance(sandbox = TRUE)
```

`AccountBalance()` returns the current balance in U.S. Dollars; for the
sandbox, this is always \$10,000. The `sandbox` parameter can also be
changed globally with `options("MTurkR.sandbox" = TRUE)`.

# Data preprocessing with *MTurkR*

A common workflow for using MTurk involves starting with a messy data
structure and wanting some better-structured resulting data structure
(within R this is presumably a data frame). To use *MTurkR*, the analyst
must break down the messy data structure into a set of individual tasks
(HITs), create those HITs via *MTurkR*, allow time for workers to
complete assignments, and then collect and review completed assignments
before proceeding with the analysis of the resulting data in R. How to
achieve this in *MTurkR*? I begin by demonstrating how to create a
single HIT and then demonstrating more convenient wrapper functions for
creating batches of HITs in bulk.

## Creating individual HITs

First, creating a HIT requires registering a HITType, which sets various
worker-visible characteristics of the HIT(s), four of which are required
and three that are optional:

-   Title, short title for the HIT to be displayed to workers
    (required).

-   Description, a description of the HIT to be displayed to workers
    (required).

-   Reward, in U.S. Dollars (required).

-   Duration, in seconds (required).

-   Keywords, a comma-separated list of keywords used by workers to
    search for HITs (optional; default is empty).

-   Assignment auto-approval delay, a time in seconds which specifies
    when assignments will automatically be paid if not first rejected
    (optional; default is 30 days).

-   Qualification requirements, a complex structure which controls which
    workers can complete the HIT (optional; default is none).

To register a HITType, at least the first four characteristics just
described need to be defined in a call to `RegisterHITType()`, for
example:

``` r
hittype1 <- RegisterHITType(title = "Tell us something", 
                            description = "Answer a single question", 
                            reward = "0.05", 
                            duration = seconds(days = 1, hours = 8), 
                            keywords = "text, answer, question", 
                            auto.approval.delay = seconds(days = 1))
```

*MTurkR*'s `seconds()` function provides a convenient way of converting
time measurements in days, hours, minutes, or seconds into a total
number of seconds. With the HITType created, one can begin creating
individual HITs associated with that HITType using `CreateHIT()`.

A HIT consists of a HITType and various HIT-specific attributes, the
most import of which is a "question" text specifying the contents of the
task as shown to the worker via an HTML iframe on the MTurk worker
website. Questions can be specified in one of several ways:

-   An HTTPS URL (or "ExternalQuestion") for a page containing the HIT
    HTML.

-   An "HTMLQuestion" structure, essentially the HTML to display to the
    worker.

-   A "QuestionForm" structure, which is a proprietary markup language
    used by MTurk.

-   A "HITLayoutID" value retrieved from the MTurk requester
    website[^7].

In addition to one of the above question specifications, the other HIT
attributes are:

-   Duration, the number of assignments to be created for the HIT
    (required; default 1).

-   Expiration, a time specifying when the HIT will expire and thus be
    unavailable to workers, in seconds (required; no default).

-   Annotation, specifying a hidden value that describes the HIT as a
    reference for the requester (optional; default is empty).

In most cases, specifying an HTMLQuestion is the easiest approach. This
simply means writing a complete, HTML5-compliant document creating a web
form that will display some material to the worker and allow them to
enter and submit answer information to the server. Some examples are
installed with *MTurkR*, such as:

``` r
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
 <head>
  <meta http-equiv='Content-Type' content='text/html; charset=UTF-8'/>
  <script type='text/javascript' 
   src='https://s3.amazonaws.com/mturk-public/externalHIT_v1.js'></script>
 </head>
 <body>
  <form name='mturk_form' method='post' id='mturk_form' 
   action='https://www.mturk.com/mturk/externalSubmit'>
  <input type='hidden' value='' name='assignmentId' id='assignmentId'/>
  <h1>What's up?</h1>
  <p><textarea name='comment' cols='80' rows='3'></textarea></p>
  <p><input type='submit' id='submitButton' value='Submit' /></p></form>
  <script language='Javascript'>turkSetAssignmentID();</script>
 </body>
</html>
```

Workers will see a rendered version of the HTMLQuestion, specifically a
question -- "What's up?" -- and a multi-line text response they can
complete. The JavaScript in the HTMLQuestion is essential for the HIT to
behave properly. To setup this HIT in the MTurk system, use
`CreateHIT()` passing it the HITTypeId created earlier, making the HIT
available for 4 days and setting a private annotation field to remind us
about the HIT:

``` r
f1 <- system.file("templates/htmlquestion1.xml", package = "MTurkR")
hq <- GenerateHTMLQuestion(file = f1)
hit1 <- CreateHIT(hit.type = hittype1$HITTypeId, 
                  question = hq$string,
                  expiration = seconds(days = 4),
                  annotation = "my first HIT")
```

At this point, a worker needs to submit the assignment. Once that has
happened (this can be checked using `HITStatus()` or
`GetHIT(hit = hit$HITId)`), the assignment data can be retrieved
through:

``` r
# Retrieve all assignments for a HIT
a1 <- GetAssignments(hit = hit1$HITId)

# Retrieve all assignments for all HITs for a HITType
a2 <- GetAssignments(hit.type = hittype1$HITTypeId)

# Retrieve a specific assignment
a3 <- GetAssignments(assign = a1$AssignmentId[1])
```

These assignments will be automatically approved after one day
(according to the value specified in `auto.approval.delay` when
registering the HITType). Assignments can be approved manually using
`ApproveAssignment()`:

``` r
# Approve 1 assignment
ApproveAssignments(assignments = a1$AssignmentId[1], 
                   feedback = "Well done!")

# Approve multiple assignments
ApproveAssignments(assignments = a1$AssignmentId)

# Approve all assignments for a HIT
ApproveAllAssignments(hit = hit1$HITId)

# Approve all assignments for all HITs of a HITType
ApproveAllAssignments(hit = hittype1$HITTypeId)

# Approve all assignments based on annotation
ApproveAllAssignments(annotation = "my first HIT")
```

Rejecting HITs works identically to the above but using
`RejectAssignments()`. Feedback is optional for assignment approval but
required for assignment rejection.[^8] Feedback is passed through the
`feedback` argument.

## Managing crowdworkers with QualificationTypes

One important consideration when creating a HIT is that, by default,
every HIT is available to all MTurk workers unless
QualificationRequirements have been specified in the `RegisterHITType()`
operation. Furthermore, these QualificationRequirements are attached to
a HITType, not an individual HIT, so HITs directed at distinct subsets
of workers need to be attached to distinct HITTypes.

There are several built-in QualificationTypes that can be used as
QualificactionRequirements, including country of residence and various
measures of experience on MTurk (e.g., number of HITs completed,
approval rate, etc.). To configure a HITType that will only be available
to workers in the United States who have completed more than 500
approved HITs, first use `GenerateQualificationRequirement()` to setup a
QualificationRequirement structure locally. This involves naming the
QualificationTypes to use in the QualificationRequirement, along with
"comparators" and "values", which are interpreted as logical statements
of the form "Locale is equal to US" and "NumberApproved is greater than
500":

``` r
# Shorthand names of location and approval qualifications
q_names <- c("Locale", "NumberApproved")

# Comparators ("==" for location and ">" for past approvals)
q_comparators <- c("==", ">")

# Qualification values ("US" for location and "500" for past approvals)
q_values <- c("US", 500)

# Convert these values into a QualificationRequirement
qreq2 <- GenerateQualificationRequirement(q_names, 
                                          q_comparators, 
                                          q_values, 
                                          preview = TRUE)
```

This structure is passed as the `qual.req` argument to
`RegisterHITType()` to create a new HITType with these
QualificationRequirements:

``` r
# Register HITType using the QualificationRequirement
hittype2 <- RegisterHITType(title = "Tell us something", 
                            description = "Answer a single question", 
                            reward = "0.05", 
                            duration = seconds(days = 1, hours = 8), 
                            keywords = "text, answer, question", 
                            auto.approval.delay = seconds(days = 15),
                            qual.req = qreq2)
```

This attaches a QualificationRequirement to all HITs created within this
new HITType, preventing workers who fail to meet the qualifications from
working on them (or in this case, given `preview = TRUE`, even viewing
the HITs).[^9]

In addition to using the built-in QualificationTypes, workers can also
be managed in other ways. One way is to block workers who consistently
perform inadequate work using `BlockWorkers()`. This should be used
sparingly, however, as workers who are repeatedly blocked will have
their MTurk accounts disabled. A data frame of previously blocked
workers is return by `GetBlockedWorkers()`. `UnblockWorkers()` is
provided to unblock workers. In addition, it is possible to email
workers using `ContactWorkers()` and supply optional bonus payments
using `GrantBonus()`. These can be useful for managing complex projects,
incentivizing good work, and inviting well-performing workers to
complete new projects.

QualificationRequirements set for a HITType can also be used to manage
workers' access to HITs. The built-in QualificationTypes are quite
useful for this, but requesters can also create more tailored
QualificationTypes based on other criteria. A common use case is to only
allow new workers to complete a HIT. The steps to achieve this are:
create a new QualificationType, assign different values for that
QualificationType to past and new workers, and then create a new HITType
using this QualificationType as a QualificationRequirement.

``` r
# Create the QualificationType
thenewqual <- CreateQualificationType(name = "Prevent Retakes",
                                      description = "Worked for me before",
                                      status = "Active",
                                      auto = TRUE,
                                      auto.value = 100)

# Assign qualification
AssignQualification(qual = thenewqual$QualificationTypeId,
                    workers = hit1$WorkerId,
                    value = "50")

# Generate QualificationRequirement
qreq3 <-  
  GenerateQualificationRequirement(thenewqual$QualificationTypeId, "==", "100")

# Create HIT, implicitly generating HITType
hit2 <- CreateHIT(question = hq$string,
                  expiration = seconds(days = 4),
                  assignments = 10,
                  title = "Tell us something", 
                  description = "Answer a single question", 
                  reward = "0.05", 
                  duration = seconds(days = 1, hours = 8), 
                  keywords = "text, answer, question", 
                  auto.approval.delay = seconds(days = 15),
                  qual.req = qreq3,
                  annotation = "my second HIT")
```

To explain what is happening here, a new QualificationType was created
that workers can "request" through the MTurk website. If they request
it, they will automatically be assigned a score of 100 on the
QualificationType. This QualificationType was assigned to all of our
workers from the first HIT but at a score lower than the automatically
granted value. Next, a QualificationRequirement was created that makes a
HIT only available to those with the automatically granted value, and,
finally, this was attached to a HITType that is created automatically
within the call to `CreateHIT()`. Now 10 new workers can complete this
HIT, excluding the worker(s) that completed work on the first HIT.

QualificationTypes and QualificationRequirements on HITTypes allow a
requester to manage a large pool of workers in complex ways. Workers
that have been assigned scores on a QualificationType can be retrieved
using `GetQualifications()`, or modified using
`UpdateQualificationScore()`. The attributes of the QualificationType
itself can be changed using `UpdateQualificationType()`, and the
QualificationType and all associated scores can be deleted using
`DisposeQualificationTypes()`.[^10] QualificationTypes can also be
configured with a "qualification test" that allows workers to submit
provisional work as a measure of abilities and then qualifications can
be approved/revoked manually based on their responses or even configured
with an "AnswerKey" that will automatically evaluate the worker's test
performance and assign a score for the QualificationType. Again, the
*MTurkR* documentation includes extended examples and possible use
cases.

When finished with a HIT and all of its assignment data, it can be
deleted from the system using `DisposeHIT()`. This is not a reversible
action, so it should be used with caution. HITs will be deleted
automatically by Amazon after a period of inactivity, but cleaning up
unneeded HITs can be useful given that there is no particularly good way
to search for HITs within the system. The `SearchHITs()` operation
simply returns a sorted data frame of all HITs.

## Creating multiple HITs

In addition to creating single HITs, *MTurkR* offers functionality to
manage very large projects involving many HITs. This section describes
that functionality in detail.

There are four functions that have been added to *MTurkR* as of v0.6.5
(available on CRAN since 25 May 2015) to facilitate the bulk creation of
HITs, for example for the earlier use case of creating a training set of
open-ended text responses for a classification algorithm. These
functions are wrappers for `CreateHIT()` designed to accept different
kinds of input for the `question` argument and cycle through those
inputs to create multiple HITs. They are:

-   `BulkCreate()` provides a low-level loop around `CreateHIT()` that
    takes a character vector of question values as input.

-   `BulkCreateFromHITLayout()` provides functionality for creating
    multiple HITs from a HITLayout created on the MTurk Requester
    website.

-   `BulkCreateFromTemplate()` provides higher-level functionality that
    translates a HIT template and a data frame of input values into a
    series of HITs.

-   `BulkCreateFromURLs()` provides a convenient way of creating
    multiple HITs from a character vector of URLs.

The last two of these are likely to be the most useful, so extended
examples are provided below.

`GenerateHITsFromTemplate()` works from a template HTMLQuestion document
containing placeholders for input values and a data frame of values, one
set of values per row. An example template is installed with *MTurkR*:

``` r
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
 <head>
  <meta http-equiv='Content-Type' content='text/html; charset=UTF-8'/>
  <script type='text/javascript' 
   src='https://s3.amazonaws.com/mturk-public/externalHIT_v1.js'></script>
 </head>
 <body>
  <form name='mturk_form' method='post' id='mturk_form' 
   action='https://www.mturk.com/mturk/externalSubmit'>
  <input type='hidden' value='' name='assignmentId' id='assignmentId'/>
  <h1>${hittitle}</h1>
  <p>${hitvariable}</p>
  <p>What do you think?</p>
  <p><textarea name='comment' cols='80' rows='3'></textarea></p>
  <p><input type='submit' id='submitButton' value='Submit' /></p></form>
  <script language='Javascript'>turkSetAssignmentID();</script>
 </body>
</html>
```

This template contains two placeholders `${hittitle}` and
`${hitvariable}`. These placeholders will by replaced by
`GenerateHITsFromTemplate()` with values specified by the `hittitle` and
`hitvariable` columns in an input data frame, creating a set of unique
HITs as one batch.

``` r
# Create input data frame
inputdf <- data.frame(hittitle = c("HIT title 1", "HIT title 2", "HIT title 3"),
                      hitvariable = c("HIT text 1", "HIT text 2", "HIT text 3"), 
                      stringsAsFactors = FALSE)

# Create HITs
bulk1 <- 
  BulkCreateFromTemplate(template = system.file("template.html", package = "MTurkR"),
                         input = inputdf,
                         annotation = paste("Bulk From Template", Sys.Date()),
                         title = "Describe a text",
                         description = "Describe this text",
                         reward = ".05",
                         expiration = seconds(days = 4),
                         duration = seconds(minutes = 5),
                         auto.approval.delay = seconds(days = 1),
                         keywords = "categorization, image, moderation, category")
```

The response structure for these functions is a list of single-row data
frames. If all HIT creation operations succeed, then the response can
easily be converted using `do.call("rbind", bulk2)` to a data frame, but
users will typically only need to examine this structure if errors
occurred. Details about the individual HITs can be retrieved at any time
using `GetHITs()` or `SearchHITs()`.

At this point workers need to complete their assignments. Because the
same value for the `annotation` was supplied to all of these HITs, the
results for all associated assignments can easily be retrieved using
`GetAssignments()`:

``` r
# Get assignments using annotation
a1 <- GetAssignments(annotation = paste("Bulk From Template", Sys.Date()))
# Get assignments using HITTypeId
a2 <- GetAssignments(hit.type = bulk1[[1]]$HITTypeId)
```

Unfortunately, MTurk does not return the contents of the `question`
parameter with the completed assignments. However HITId is included so
it is trivial to merge the input data frame with the assignment data
frame allowing the comparison of the original data (e.g., open-ended
response text) to the information supplied by workers (e.g., the
classification):

``` r
# Extract HITIds from `bulk1`
inputvalues$HITId <- do.call("rbind", bulk1)$HITId

# Merge `inputvalues` and `assignmentresults`
merge(inputdf, a1, all = TRUE, by = "HITId")
```

`BulkCreateFromURLs()` behaves similarly but accepts a character vector
of URLs to be used as ExternalQuestion values. This function requires a
`frame.height` argument to specify the vertical size of the HIT as shown
to workers.[^11]

``` r
bulk2 <- 
  BulkCreateFromURLs(url = paste0("https://www.example.com/", 1:3, ".html"),
                     frame.height = 450,
                     annotation = paste("Bulk From URLs", Sys.Date()),
                     title = "Categorize an image",
                     description = "Categorize this image",
                     reward = ".05",
                     expiration = seconds(days = 4),
                     duration = seconds(minutes = 5),
                     auto.approval.delay = seconds(days = 1),
                     keywords = "categorization, image, moderation, category")
```

## Addressing problems

Sometimes things go wrong. Perhaps the HITs contained incorrect
information or the work being performed is of low quality because of a
mistake in the HIT's instructions. When these situations occur, it is
easy to address problems using a host of HIT-management functions. To
expire a HIT early, simply call `ExpireHIT()` specifying a HITId,
HITTypeId, or annotation value. To delay the expiration of HIT by a
specified number of seconds use `ExtendHIT()` with its `add.seconds`
argument. A call to `ExtendHIT()` with the `add.assignments` parameter
increases the number of available assignments for the HIT(s).[^12]

One other useful set of operations provided by MTurk is a "notification"
system that allows requesters to receive messages about various HITType
events either via email or to an AWS Simple Queue Service (SQS) queue
(see *MTurkR* documentation for examples of the latter). Notifications
can be triggered by various events and can be used as an alternative to
actively monitoring the status of a HIT vai `HITStatus()`. Here is an
example notification to send an email whenever a HIT of a given HITType
expires:

``` r
n <- GenerateNotification("requester@example.com", 
                          event.type = "HITExpired")
SetHITTypeNotification(hit.type = hittype1$HITTypeId,
                       notification = n,
                       active = TRUE)
```

# An example of massive-scale photo rating

To demonstrate the ease with which *MTurkR* can be used to preprocess a
massive amount of data, I provide an example of a large-scale
photo-rating task. Here, I was interested in obtaining a rating of
"facial competence" for U.S. politicians compared with ratings of faces
from the general U.S. population. Facial competence is said to enhance
politicians' electoral success, but previous studies have never compared
these to a general population sample. Are politicians generally more
facially competent than other individuals? While this is a modest
research question, it demonstrates well the immense human effort needed
to draw even simple conclusions from messy data structures.

![Figure 1: Example photo rating HIT.](hit2.png){#fig:hit2 width="100%"
style="text-align: center"  alt="graphic without alt text"}

To provide a sampling of politicians' faces, I scraped photos of 533
members of the 113th U.S. Congress from the website of the Government
Printing Office. I then combined these photo data with 5000 randomly
sampled images from the 10K U.S. Adult Faces Database
[@BainbridgeIsolaOliva2013], which provides a nationally representative
sampling of U.S. faces, and standardized the image size and resolution
across all faces.[^13] To rate facial competence, I created a simple
one-question HIT using HTML (see Figure [1](#fig:hit2)) that displayed
one of the faces and asked for a rating of facial competence on a 0 to
10 scale.[^14] I include the complete HTML file in the supplemental
material for this article.

After uploading all 5533 images to an Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3)
bucket, which is a simple cloud storage facility, to make the files
publicly available[^15] and storing their filenames in a local RDS file,
it was trivial to send these images to MTurk workers for categorization.
To ensure reliability of the results, each face was rated by 5 workers.
Workers were given 45 seconds to rate each face and were paid \$0.01 per
face. The 27,665 images were rated by a team of 225 U.S.-based workers
over a period of 75 minutes. The entire operation cost \$412.50.
Achieving this required three steps in *MTurkR*: (1) creating a
QualificationRequirement to restrict the task to U.S.-based workers with
95% approval ratings, (2) registering a HITType into which the HITs will
be created, and (3) the creation of a batch of HITs using
`BatchCreateFromURLs()`.

``` r
# Setup QualificationRequirement
## U.S.-based, 95% approval on HITs
qual <-  GenerateQualificationRequirement(c("Locale", "Approved"), 
                                          c("==", ">"), 
                                          c("US", 95), 
                                          preview = TRUE)

# Register HITType
desc <- "Judge the competence of a person from an image of their face.
  The HIT involves only one question: a rating of the competence of the
  person. You have 45 seconds to complete the HIT. There are several
  thousand HITs available in this batch. If you recognize the person,
  please enter their name in the space provided; your work will still be
  approved even if you recognize the face."
hittype <- 
  RegisterHITType(title = "Rate the competence of a person",
                  description = desc,
                  reward = "0.01",
                  duration = seconds(seconds = 45), 
                  auto.approval.delay = seconds(days = 1),
                  qual.req = qual,
                  keywords = "categorization, photo, image, rating, fast, easy")
                  
# All faces were loaded into Amazon S3
s3url <- "https://s3.amazonaws.com/mturkfaces/"
# File names were saved as a character vector locally
faces <- readRDS("faces_all.RDS")
d <- data.frame(face = paste0(s3url,faces), 
                stringsAsFactors = FALSE)

# Create 5500 HITs
bulk <- BulkCreateFromTemplate(template = "mturk.html",
                               frame.height = 550,
                               input = d,
                               hit.type = hittype$HITTypeId,
                               expiration = seconds(days = 7),
                               # 5 assignments/face 
                               assignments = 5,
                               annotation = "Face Categorization 2015-06-08")
```

Using the specified `annotation` value, `GetAssignments()` returns a
large data frame with 27670 rows and 25 columns:

``` r
a <- GetAssignments(annotation = "Face Categorization 2015-06-08")
dim(a)
# [1] 27670    25
names(a)
#  [1] "AssignmentId"          "WorkerId"              "HITId"                
#  [4] "AssignmentStatus"      "AutoApprovalTime"      "AcceptTime"           
#  [7] "SubmitTime"            "ApprovalTime"          "RejectionTime"        
# [10] "RequesterFeedback"     "ApprovalRejectionTime" "SecondsOnHIT"         
# [13] "competent"             "recognized"            "name"                 
# [16] "face"                  "condition"             "browser"              
# [19] "engine"                "platform"              "language"             
# [22] "width"                 "height"                "resolution"           
# [25] "problem"
```

Most of the columns contain metadata for identifying each assignment
(AssignmentId, WorkerId, HITId), metadata about the completion of the
assignment (AssignmentStatus, AutoAprpovalTime, AcceptTime, SubmitTime,
ApprovalTime, RejectionTime, RequesterFeedback, ApprovalRejectionTime,
SecondsOnHIT), and then several columns displaying responses to the
three HIT questions displayed to the workers: `competent`, `recognized`,
and `name`. The names of these variables are given by the `name`
attribute of the radio buttons used in the HTMLQuestion form. The data
frame also contains additional variables that record metadata about the
worker's browser, which were recorded automatically via Javascript.

As noted earlier, a limitation of the MTurk API is that it does not
return information about the values of variables replaced in the
templating process, so it can be difficult to identify which
assignment(s) correspond to which input values. To circumvent this
limitation, this HIT template was designed to use the `${face}` variable
twice: once to actually display the image to the worker and once to
record its value in a hidden field called `face` in the HTMLQuestion
form. As a result, this variable becomes available to us in the results
data frame.

Setup in this way, it becomes trivial to analyze facial competence
ratings of politicians and those from the general population sample. To
perform the analysis, I simply conducted a Mann-Whitney-Wilcoxon test
for a difference in competence ratings between the faces of politicians
and non-politicians. (In these data, politicians' photos were identified
by a simple pattern matching file name. This would have more easily been
done with a hidden HTML variable when creating the batch.) So, I extract
the two variables from the assignment data frame, convert them to
numeric, and perform the test:

``` r
competence <- as.numeric(a$competent)
politician <- as.numeric(grepl("[[:digit:]]{2}-[[:digit:]]{3}", a$face))

round(prop.table(table(politician, competence), 1), 2)
#
#           competence
# politician    0    1    2    3    4    5    6    7    8    9   10
#          0 0.03 0.03 0.04 0.07 0.11 0.13 0.17 0.17 0.16 0.06 0.02
#          1 0.01 0.01 0.02 0.04 0.07 0.12 0.19 0.20 0.22 0.09 0.04

wilcox.test(competence ~ politician)
# 
#         Wilcoxon rank sum test with continuity correction
# 
# data:  competence by politician
# W = 26886000, p-value < 2.2e-16
# alternative hypothesis: true location shift is not equal to 0
```

Politicians do appear to have higher facial competence. While this is a
fairly trivial analytic conclusion, it demonstrates the ease with which
crowdsourced human intelligence can be leveraged to preprocess a massive
amount of data, translating messy sources into easily analyzed data.
Because crowdsourcing is inherently massively parallel, it dramatically
reduces the amount of time needed to parse a rough data source. In this
case, the MTurk workers created the completed dataset in about 75
minutes. Were a single individual to attempt this task alone and it took
(as a generous estimate) only 5 seconds to categorize each face, the
task would be completed in 38.4 hours, or about 31-times as long as with
MTurk.

# Conclusion

This paper has described the MTurk platform and offered an introduction
to the R package *MTurkR* focused on preprocessing of messy data for
immediate use in R. In short, *MTurkR* provides a stable, well-developed
R interface to one of the largest crowdsourcing sites presently
available. The package has been developed and refined for more than
three years, has extensive in-package and online documentation, and is
incredibly easy to use. By providing a low-level wrapper to the Amazon
Mechanical Turk API, it also means that *MTurkR* could serve well as the
basis for much more sophisticated R applications that leverage human
intelligence as an enhancement to the computational features already
available in R.

    experimental applications should consult @Leeper2013a and the
    *MTurkR* documentation.

[^2]: Workers also communicate about the quality of HITs and requesters
    on fora such as TurkOpticon
    (<http://turkopticon.differenceengines.com/>), MTurk Forum
    (<http://mturkforum.com/>), Turker Nation
    (<http://www.turkernation.com/>), and Reddit pages
    (<http://www.reddit.com/r/HITsWorthTurkingFor/> and
    <http://www.reddit.com/r/mturk>).

[^3]: Note that Amazon also charges a surcharge on all worker payments.
    Also, if the requester thinks the work merits additional
    compensation (or perhaps if workers are rewarded for completing
    multiple HITs of a given HITType), the requester can also pay a
    bonus of any amount to the worker at any point in the future.

[^4]: *MTurkR* also offers a set of interactive command-line menus for
    performing *MTurkR* operations without the need to write any code.
    An add-on package called
    [*MTurkRGUI*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=MTurkRGUI)
    [@mturkrgui] implements an even more robust graphical user interface
    using the cross-platform
    [*tcltk*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=tcltk) package.
    Additional details about these *MTurkR* features are available in
    the package documentation and on the *MTurkR* wiki at
    <https://www.github.com/leeper/MTurkR>.

[^5]: Note that MTurk is currently only available to requesters with a
    United States address and a Social Security number.

[^6]: As a convenience, by default, all API requests and responses are
    stored in a tab-separated-value log file in the user's working
    directory, alongside information about API requests.

[^7]: This is useful for creating HITs using *MTurkR* based on templates
    created on the MTurk requester website.

[^8]: Rejected assignments can also be converted to approved within 30
    days of rejection, though the reverse operation is not possible.

[^9]: HITTypes cannot be edited. If you attempt to create two HITTypes
    with identical properties, they will be assigned the same HITTypeId.
    If you modify any attribute, a new HITType will be created. If you
    have HITs that you would like to assign to a different HITType, use
    `ChangeHITType()`.

[^10]: If a QualificationType is requestable but not automatically
    approved, qualification scores have to be granted manually by the
    requester. The additional functions `GetQualificationRequests()`,
    `GrantQualification()`, and `RevokeQualification()` can be used to
    manage requests.

[^11]: MTurk displays the page specified by the ExternalQuestion URL
    inside an HTML iframe on the worker site.

[^12]: Note that this number must be positive and, therefore, the number
    of available assignments cannot be reduced. If it is needed to
    reduce the number of assignments completed for a HIT, the HIT can be
    expired once the desired number of assignments have been completed.

[^14]: The HIT additionally included questions to address possible
    problems (i.e., a subject recognizes a face or the image did not
    display properly).

[^15]: Any public file host could be used, not just S3.
