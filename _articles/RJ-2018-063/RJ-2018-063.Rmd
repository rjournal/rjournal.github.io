title: 'sdpt3r: Semidefinite Quadratic Linear Programming in R'
abstract: We present the package sdpt3r, an R implementation of the Matlab package
  SDPT3 (Toh et al., 1999). The purpose of the software is to solve semidefinite quadratic
  linear programming (SQLP) problems, which encompasses problems such as D-optimal
  experimental design, the nearest correlation matrix problem, and distance weighted
  discrimination, as well as problems in graph theory
