Thanks a lot for the final comments and feedback. We addressed all comments as noted below.

p2 - There shouldn't be a - after Boolean in "Boolean- (AND,OR)" 
-> Thanks for catching that, we changed it

p3 - "In the next sections," = "In the following sections," 
-> We replaced it as noted

p4 - Table 2 text is very small, can you make that text same size as others. - 
-> Thanks for noting that, we increased the text size of table 2. Both tables now have the same font size and are consistent with the font size of the manuscript.

p6,7 - For Figures 1 and 2, I don't see the reason for a gradient color scale, but it's also ok to leave it as is. It's visually pleasing, just gives the sense of an ordinary variable.
-> We would like to keep the color as it is, as it is the default in the package.

p9,10 - Add leading zeroes to numbers starting with . in bottom of page 9 and in Table 3, to match up with 0.88 in bottom of p9 and also to make it easier for reading. 
-> Thanks for catching that, we changed it.

p10 - Figure 3 - I recommend making this a bit larger, you can do two rows of 3 facets, so the text is roughly the same size as the rest of the document. This will avoid overlap on numbers like in the SIRIS facet as well. 
-> We increased the figure size as suggested by doing two rows of 3 facets. 

As your data is large and you are providing on an external website, you should put instructions for obtaining these files in the code file and make sure that paths etc match those of the downloaded files
-> We now provide the data in the following zenodo repository: https://zenodo.org/records/11060662. We adapted the script so that the data are directly read from zenodo.

Also, I’m getting an error with the code on line 22,  "expanded path length 1024 would be too long…” .
-> I’m getting the same message, although it is a warning and the code works as expected. I unfortunately was not able to resolve the warning. 

Then, the code to construct  benchmark_table used in Figure 3 is not provided.
-> Thanks for catching that, the code is now included in the file.
