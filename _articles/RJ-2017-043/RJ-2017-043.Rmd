title: 'LeArEst: Length and Area Estimation from Data Measured with Additive Error'
abstract: |
  This paper describes an R package ***LeArEst*** that can be used for
  estimating object dimensions from a noisy image. The package is based
  on a simple parametric model for data that are drawn from uniform
  distribution contaminated by an additive error. Our package is able to
  estimate the length of the object of interest on a given straight line
  that intersects it, as well as to estimate the object area when it is
  elliptically shaped. The input data may be a numerical vector or an
  image in JPEG format. In this paper, background statistical models and
  methods for the package are summarized, and the algorithms and key
  functions implemented are described. Also, examples that demonstrate
  its usage are provided.\
  **Availability:** ***LeArEst*** is available on CRAN.

# Introduction

Image noise may arise by the physical processes of imaging, or it can be
caused by the presence of some unwanted structures (e.g., soft tissue
captured in X-ray images of bones). Such problems can occur, for
example, when the object is observed with a fluorescent microscope
[@ruzin1999plant], ground penetrating radar, medical equipment (X-ray,
ultrasound), etc. With the presence of additive noise, the detection of
the object edge as well as determining length or area of the object
becomes a non-trivial problem. The well known edge detection methods
[@qiu2005image; @canny1986computational] generally do not perform well.

Our approach does not use the mentioned edge detection methods, but
looks at the problem in a different way. We start with a simple
univariate model where the data represent independent realizations of a
random variable $X$, $X = U + \varepsilon$. In the aforementioned
equation $U$ is supposed to be uniformly distributed over the object
image and describes the object image without an error, while
$\varepsilon$ represents measurement error. It is shown that such a
simple model can also be very useful in applications itself, not only
related to the image analysis. For instance, in @tolic2017non the sum of
uniform and normal distributions is confirmed to be the most
representative distribution for modelling transmission loss data.

Different aspects of this model are developed in @benvsic2007estimating,
@benvsic2007border, @benvsic2010estimating, @benvsic2016uniform,
@sabo2009border, and @schneeweiss2004estimating. The basic
one-dimensional model is described in Section
[2](#MathematicalBackground) together with the results that are used for
statistical inference incorporated in the package. Although this model
is not universal in all applications, we find it useful in some cases.

With the assumption that the observed object has a circular or
elliptical shape, a two-dimensional approach has been developed, dealing
with an object area estimation problem
[@benvsic2007border; @sabo2009border]. This approach utilizes many
border estimations and performs parametric curve fitting on its results.

The package [***LeArEst***](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=LeArEst)
[@pkg_LeArEst] uses these methods for length and area estimation of an
object captured with noise. It supports numerical inputs, which is
useful if a machine that records an object stores numerical data
(coordinates of recorded points). However, if an object is captured in a
picture file, the package includes a web interface with which one can
load a picture, specify a line that intersects the object, adjust the
parameters, and perform an edge detection on the drawn line. Another web
interface allows the user to draw a rectangle around the object and
perform area estimation of the marked object. Description of functions
dealing with numerical and graphical estimations and examples of their
use are given in Section [3](#PackageOverview).

# Basic statistical model {#MathematicalBackground}

The basic model we deal with in this package is an additive error model
$$X=U+\varepsilon.$$
Here we suppose that the random variable $U$ is uniformly distributed on
the interval $\left[-a,a \right]$, $a>0$, i.e., has a density
$$\label{duniform}
f_{U}(x;a)=\left\{\begin{array}{ll}\frac{1}{2a},& x\in [-a,a].\\
0,&\mbox{else}\end{array}\right.   (\#eq:duniform)$$
and $\varepsilon$ is an absolutely continuous random variable describing
measurement error. Further, we assume that $\varepsilon$ is independent
of $U$ with zero mean. Instead of the sample $U_{1},U_{2},\ldots,U_{n}$
from $U$, one can only observe the contaminated i.i.d. sample
$X_{1},X_{2},\ldots,X_{n}$ from $X$. We are to estimate the unknown
parameter $a$.

Our model is the special case of a general additive error model
$X=Y+\varepsilon$, where $Y$ and $\varepsilon$ are assumed to be
independent continuous random variables, but only $X$ is observable.
Estimating the unknown density $f_{Y}$ from an i.i.d. sample
$X_{1},X_{2},\ldots,X_{n},X_{1}\sim X$, is known as the deconvolution
problem. Usually, the error part $\varepsilon$ is assumed to have a
known density $f_{\varepsilon}$. Several nonparametric methods have been
developed to estimate $f_{Y}$ [@Meister2009]; the most popular and
studied is the deconvolution kernel density estimator
[@Caroll1988; @Stefanski1990]. The packages
[***decon***](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=decon) [@pkg_decon] and
[***deamer***](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=deamer) [@pkg_deamer]
provide functions for estimating density $f_{Y}$ in a nonparametric way.
Two different approaches in estimating the support of a density from a
contaminated sample can be seen in [@Meister2006] and [@Delaigle2006].
One is based on the deconvolving kernel density estimator
[@Delaigle2006] and the other on the moment estimation [@Meister2006].
To our knowledge, none of them is implemented in some R package
submitted to the CRAN repository.

For our purpose (e.g., estimating borders of some object from a noisy
image), we find that the model with $Y\sim\mathcal{U}[-a,a]$ is useful
in some instances. Namely, in many cases we have a relatively high
contrast between an object and its background as it is the case in
Figure [1](#fig:histogram). It seems reasonable to assume that the data
extracted from the green line in Figure [1](#fig:histogram) come from a
uniform distribution, but contaminated by an additive error.

![Figure 1: Line intersecting the object and histogram of recorded
points for statistical inferences](Fig_histogram.png){#fig:histogram
width="100%" alt="graphic without alt text"}

Let $f_{\varepsilon}$ and $F_{\varepsilon}$ be the density and
distribution function of the error part $\varepsilon$. Then the density
of $X=U+\varepsilon$ is
$$\label{fX1}
f_{X}(x;a)=\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}f_{U}(t)f_{\varepsilon}(x-t)dt=\frac{1}{2a}\left(F_\varepsilon(x+a)-F_\varepsilon(x-a)\right).   (\#eq:fX1)$$
If we suppose that the distribution of $\varepsilon$ belongs to a scale
family, with scale parameter $\sigma$, then (\@ref(eq:fX1)) may be
rewritten as

$$\label{fX2}
f_{X}(x;a,\sigma)=\frac{1}{2a}\left(F\left( \frac{x+a}{\sigma}\right) -F\left( \frac{x-a}{\sigma}\right) \right),   (\#eq:fX2)$$
with $F(x)$ being the standard ($\sigma=1$ and zero mean) distribution
function.

Let $\mathbf{x}=\left(x_{1},\ldots,x_{n}\right)$ denote the realization
of the i.i.d. sample $\mathbf{X}=\left(X_{1},\ldots,X_{n}\right)$. The
likelihood function has the form
$$\label{lh}
L\left(a,\sigma;\mathbf{x} \right)=\prod_{i=1}^{n}f_{X}(x_{i};a,\sigma)=\frac{1}{(2a)^{n}}\prod_{i=1}^{n}\left(F\left(\frac{x_{i}+a}{\sigma}\right)-F\left(\frac{x_{i}-a}{\sigma}\right)\right),   (\#eq:lh)$$
and the log-likelihood function is given by
$$\label{llh}
l(a,\sigma)=-n\log(2a)+\sum_{i=1}^{n}\log \left(F\left(\frac{x_{i}+a}{\sigma}\right)-F\left(\frac{x_{i}-a}{\sigma}\right)\right).   (\#eq:llh)$$
If the distribution of $\varepsilon$ is symmetric around zero, then the
Fisher information is
$$I(a)=\frac{-1}{a^{2}}+\frac{1}{a\sigma^{2}}\int_{0}^{\infty}\frac{\left( f\left(\frac{x+a}{\sigma}\right)+f\left(\frac{x-a}{\sigma}\right)\right)^{2} }{F\left(\frac{x+a}{\sigma}\right)-F\left(\frac{x-a}{\sigma}\right)}\,dx.$$
Supposing that parameter $\sigma$ is known or consistently estimated
then, under regularity, we have
$$\label{ad}
\sqrt{n}\left(\hat{a}_{ML}-a_{0} \right)\stackrel{D}\longrightarrow\mathcal{N}\left(0,\frac{1}{I(a_{0})}\right),   (\#eq:ad)$$
where $a_{0}$ is the true value of $a$.

Some flexibility of our model is achieved by changing the error
distribution. For now, three types of error distributions are available
in the package. The normal distribution
$\varepsilon\sim\mathcal{N}\left(0,\sigma^{2}\right)$ is sometimes a
natural choice. Properties of maximum likelihood (ML) and method of
moments (MM) estimators with known $\sigma^{2}$ are given in
@benvsic2007estimating. The model with $Y\sim\mathcal{U}[0,a]$ is
treated in @schneeweiss2004estimating. @benvsic2010estimating considered
the unknown $\sigma^{2}$ case. The possibility of this (one-dimensional)
model in two-dimensional problems is given in @benvsic2007border and
@sabo2009border. For the sake of robustness Laplace and scaled Student
(with $5$ degrees of freedom) distributions are also incorporated in the
package as a choice of the error distribution. Estimating issues with
Laplacian error can be seen in @benvsic2016uniform, as well as a
discussion connected to robustness.

Two procedures for deriving confidence intervals for $a$ are described
in [@hamedovic2017]. The first one is based on the asymptotic
distribution of ML estimator in (\@ref(eq:ad)). For a specified
$0<\alpha<1$, an asymptotic $(1-\alpha)100\%$ confidence interval for
$a$ is[^1]

$$\left(\hat{a}_{ML}-\frac{z_{\alpha /2}}{\sqrt{nI(\hat{a}_{ML}) } },\hat{a}_{ML}+\frac{z_{\alpha /2}}{\sqrt{nI(\hat{a}_{ML}) }} \right).$$
The second method is based on the likelihood ratio statistic
$$\lambda(\mathbf{X})=\frac{\sup\limits_{H_{0}}L\left(a;\mathbf{X} \right)}{\displaystyle\sup_{(0,\infty)}L\left(a;\mathbf{X} \right)}=\frac{L\left(a_{0};\mathbf{X} \right)}{L\left(\hat{a}_{ML};\mathbf{X} \right)}.$$
From the asymptotic distribution of the log-likelihood ratio statistic
$$-2\log \lambda(\mathbf{X}) \stackrel{D}\longrightarrow \chi_{1}^{2}$$
an approximate $(1-\alpha)100\%$ confidence interval for $a$ is
$$\left\lbrace a\vert\, l(\hat{a}_{ML})-l(a)\leq 0.5\chi^{2}_{1}(1-\alpha)\right\rbrace,$$
where $\chi^{2}_{1}(1-\alpha)$ is the $1-\alpha$ quantile of
$\chi_{1}^{2}$ distribution.

These two approaches can be used to test hypotheses regarding the
parameter $a$. For example, in the case of a two-sided hypotheses
$H_{0}:a=a_{0}$ versus $H_{1}:a\neq a_{0}$, the critical regions of
asymptotic size $\alpha$ are
$$\left\lbrace \mathbf{x}\vert\, \sqrt{nI(a_{0})}|\hat{a}_{ML}-a_{0}|\geq z_{\alpha /2} \right\rbrace, \text{ and}$$

$$\left\lbrace \mathbf{x}\vert\, -2\log \lambda(\mathbf{x})\geq \chi_{1}^{2}(1-\alpha) \right\rbrace,$$
respectively. Note that both methods are asymptotically equivalent.

## Length estimation --- a numerical data set {#subsec:lengthest}

The function `lengthest` computes the length of an interval which is the
domain of a uniform distribution from data contaminated by an additive
error according to the model described in the previous section. The
function's arguments and results are given in Table
[2](#tab:lengthest_args).

::: {#tab:lengthest_args}
  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Arguments      Description
  -------------- ------------------------------------------------------------------
  `x`            Vector of input data.

  `error`        Error distribution.

  `var`          Error variance.

  `var.est`      Method of error variance estimation.

  `conf.level`   Confidence level of the confidence interval. Defaults to $0.95$.

  Results        Description

  `radius`       Estimated half-length of the uniform support.

  `var.error`    Error variance, estimated or explicitly given by argument `var`.

  `conf.int`     Confidence interval for half-length of the uniform support.

  `method`       Method used for computing a confidence interval

                 (asymptotic distribution of ML or likelihood ratio statistic).
  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  : Table 2: Summary of arguments and results of `lengthest`
:::

In order to perform length estimation, a type of the error distribution
must be chosen through the argument `error` with three possibilities:
`laplace` [@benvsic2016uniform], `gauss`
[@benvsic2007estimating; @benvsic2010estimating], or `student` (scaled
Student distribution with 5 degrees of freedom).

The variance of the additive error may or may not be known. If the
variance is known, argument `var` should be used and the variance should
be assigned to it. In the case of unknown variance, function `lengthest`
implements two methods for its estimation: *Method of Moments* and
*Maximum Likelihood*. Value `MM` of the argument `var.est` instructs the
functions to use Method of Moments, while the corresponding value `ML`
triggers Maximum Likelihood Method. There is the possibility, depending
on the input data, that the Method of Moments estimate of error variance
does not exist. When that is the case, the function stops and outputs
the message instructing the user to use Maximum Likelihood estimator or
to give an explicit variance. It is important to mention that arguments
`var` and `var.est` may not be used simultaneously.

The last argument, `conf.level`, specifies the confidence level of the
confidence interval calculated by the function.

The results of this function are the estimated half-length of uniform
distribution (i.e., of an object), estimated or explicitly given error
variance, confidence interval for half-length (with regard to the given
confidence level) and the statistical method for computing a confidence
interval.

**Usage example.** Let us generate a sample of size $1000$ from
$X=U+\varepsilon$, where $U\sim\mathcal{U}\left[-1, 1\right]$ and
$\varepsilon\sim\mathcal{N}\left(0,(0.1)^{2}\right)$:

``` r
set.seed(12)
sample_1 <- runif(1000, -1, 1)
sample_2 <- rnorm(1000, 0, 0.1)
sample <- sample_1 + sample_2
```

![Figure 2: Estimation of the density
function](Fig_density_uni_norm.png){#fig:density_uni_norm width="100%" alt="graphic without alt text"}

Figure [2](#fig:density_uni_norm) shows density estimation from the
generated data obtained with the R function `density`. A half-length
estimation of the uniform support for these data can be done with the
following command:

``` r
lengthest(x = sample, error = "gauss", var.est = "MM", conf.level = 0.90)
```

The most important part of its output is:

``` r
$radius
MLE for radius (a) of uniform distr.: 0.9916513
$var.error
MM estimate for error variance: 0.01279636
$method
[1] "Asymptotic distribution of LR statistic"
$conf.int
[1] 0.9724316 1.0116479
```

## Testing hypothesis --- a numerical data set

Function `lengthtest` performs one-sided and two-sided tests against
hypothesized half-length of the uniform support as it is described in
Section [2](#MathematicalBackground). Since the actual calculations
inside this function are based on the ML approach most input arguments
are similar to those in the function `lengthest` (see Table
[3](#tab:lengthtest_args)). Argument `null.a` is a positive number
representing hypothesized half-length of the uniform support, while
argument `alternative` defines the usual forms of alternatives
(`two.sided`, `greater`, or `less`).

::: {#tab:lengthtest_args}
  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Arguments       Description
  --------------- ------------------------------------------------------------------
  `x`             Vector of input data.

  `error`         Error distribution.

  `null.a`        Specified null value being tested.

  `alternative`   The form of the alternative hypothesis.

  `var`           Error variance.

  `var.est`       Method of error variance estimation.

  `conf.level`    Confidence level of the confidence interval. Defaults to $0.95$.

  Results         Description

  `p.value`       *p-value* of the test.

  `tstat`         The value of the test statistic.

  `radius`        Estimated half-length of the uniform support.

  `var.error`     Error variance, estimated or explicitly given by argument `var`.

  `conf.int`      Confidence interval for half-length.

  `method`        Method used for computing a confidence interval

                  (asymptotic distribution of ML or likelihood ratio statistic).
  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  : Table 3: Summary of arguments and results of `lengthtest`
:::

Function `lengthtest` also performs length estimation, so all values
from its output, except `p.value` and the calculated value of the test
statistic (`tstat`), are the same as that of the function `lengthest`.

**Usage example.** Generate the data in a similar manner as in the
`lengthest` example:

``` r
set.seed(12)
sample_1 <- runif(1000, -1, 1)
sample_2 <- rnorm(1000, 0, 0.1)
sample <- sample_1 + sample_2
```

To test that the uniform support half-length equals $1$ against that it
is less than $1$ the function `lengthest` can be used in the following
way:

``` r
lengthtest(x = sample, error = "gauss", alternative = "less", var.est = "MM",
           null.a = 1, conf.level = 0.95)
```

Part of the output dealing with a testing procedure is:

``` r
$p.value
[1] 0.2418929
$tstat
[1] -0.7002265
```

## Area estimation --- a numerical data set {#subsec:areaest}

The input for the function `areaest` is supposed to be a data set of
points in the plane representing independent realizations of a
two-dimensional random vector
$$X=U+\varepsilon.$$
It is assumed that $U$ has a uniform distribution on an ellipsoid and
$\varepsilon$ is a two-dimensional error term independent of $U$.
Arguments and results of this function are listed in Table
[4](#tab:areaest_args).

::: {#tab:areaest_args}
  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Arguments    Description
  ------------ -------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  `data`       Two-column data matrix containing the points that describe the

               observed object. The first column represents the $x$ coordinate of the point,

               while the second column represents its $y$ coordinate.

  `nrSlices`   Number of slices applied for plain data cutting. Defaults to 10.

  `error`      Error distribution.

  `var`        Error variance.

  `var.est`    Method of error variance estimation.

  `plot`       Logical parameter that determines whether to plot data set, calculated

               edge points, and the resulting ellipse. Defaults to `FALSE`.

  Results      Description

  `area`       Estimated area of the object.

  `points`     Set of estimated object's edge points.

  `semiaxes`   Resulting ellipse's semi-axes.
  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  : Table 4: Summary of arguments and results of `areaest`
:::

The algorithm implemented in the function `areaest` is explained in
detail in [@benvsic2007border]. The main task in area estimation is to
estimate edge points of the uniform support. In order to achieve this,
the original problem is reduced to several corresponding one-dimensional
problems, which can in turn be solved by function `lengthest`.

Let us denote the data set with
$D = \left\{\left(x_i, y_i \right), i = 1, \dots, n \right\}$. The
function `areast` transforms this data set in two different ways:
through the $y$-axis and through the $x$-axis. The algorithm for
transformation through the $y$-axis is presented below, while the
transformation through the $x$-axis is done analogously.

#### Algorithm 1 {#alg:areaest}

(*Transformation through the $y$-axis [@benvsic2007border]*)

Separating through the $y$-axis.

Choose an integer $m<n$ and real numbers
$\eta_1 < \eta_2 < \dots < \eta_m$ such that

-   $\eta_{1} \le \min \{ y_i : i=1,\dots n \}, \ \max \{ y_i : i=1,\dots n\} \le \eta_{m}$
    and

-   $C_k := \{(x_i,y_i) \in D : y_i \in [ \eta_k, \eta_{k+1}] \},\ k=1, \ldots, m-1$
    is a nonempty set.

Centering through the $y$-axis.

Let us denote
$$c_k := \frac{1}{\left|C_k\right| } \sum_{\left(x_i,y_i\right) \in C_k } x_i, \ d_k := \frac{1}{\left|C_k\right|} \sum_{\left(x_i,y_i\right) \in C_k } y_i,$$

$$k=1,\dots,m-1,$$
for $k=1,\dots,m-1$ define
$\overline C_k := \left\{ x_i-c_k : \left( x_i, y_i \right) \in C_k \right\}$.

Using this algorithm the data are transformed in the way that we have
sets $\overline C_k,\  k=1,\dots,m-1$ that represent centered tiny
strips. Argument `nrSlices` corresponds to $m-1$ and specifies the
number of strips. The lengths of these strips (in $x$-direction) can be
estimated using the function `lengthest` (the parameters `error`, `var`,
and `var.est` are used in a `lengthest` call in the way described
earlier). After doing so, the algorithm needs to be repeated through the
$x$-axis. Finally, at this point of the procedure, the data that is a
noisy version of points from the curve is created -- it represents
estimated points from the border of the object.

The next task is to choose one of the well-known curve fitting
procedures for parameter estimation. Here we are dealing with a
nonlinear parameter estimation problem.

Let us suppose that we have an elliptical domain, i.e.,

$$\mathcal{D}(\mathbf{p}) = \left\{ (x,y) \in \mathbb{R}^2 : \frac{(x-p)^2}{\alpha^2} + \frac{(y-q)^2}{\beta^2} \le 1 \right\},$$

$$\mathbf{p} = \left(p, q, \alpha, \beta\right)^T.$$

On the basis of data obtained so far, the vector of unknown parameters
$p$ needs to be estimated, and by doing so, the optimal ellipse that
fits into our points is to be defined. For this purpose
`EllipseDirectFit` function from the ***conicfit*** package is used.
This function implemets the algebraic ellipse fit method by
Fitzgibbon-Pilu-Fisher [@fitzgibbon1999direct]. Having parameters $p$,
it is a trivial task to calculate the area of the ellipse that
approximates the observed object.

**Usage example.** Two internal files are provided with the package:
`ellipse_3_4_0.1_gauss.txt` and `ellipse_3_4_0.1_laplace.txt`. Both of
them represent an ellipsoidal object with center in point $(1,1)$,
half-axes $1.5$ and $2$, with added measurement error. In the first
file, the error distribution is a two-dimensional normal with
independent margins and variance 0.01, while in the other it is
Laplacian ($\lambda=0.1$) in both directions, again with independent
margins.

In order to use one of these files, the data needs to be read into a
data frame:

``` r
inputfile <- system.file("extdata", "ellipse_3_4_0.1_laplace.txt", package = "LeArEst")
inputdata <- read.table(inputfile)
```

Area estimation of the uniform support can be done with the command:

``` r
areaest(inputdata, error = "laplace", var.est = "ML", nrSlices = 5, plot = TRUE)
```

In the previous example, the parameter `plot` is set to `TRUE`, so the
function plots the given input data (black dots), estimated border
points (red dots), and the resulting ellipse (cyan ellipse); see Figure
[3](#fig:areaest).

## Length estimation and testing for an object shown in a picture

In order to apply the described methods to a picture of an object, two
web interfaces have been built and embedded into the package.

As far as we know,
[***shiny***](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=shiny) [@pkg_shiny]
provides the simplest way of building web applications using R. However,
limitations of its free version discouraged us from using it, so we
decided to use the ***opencpu*** package. This package provides a
reliable and interoperable HTTP API for data analysis based on R.
Basically, it provides an interface between functions in R package and a
custom-made web page bundled with the package, using JavaScript and
AJAX. Building web interfaces using ***opencpu*** is more complex than
using ***shiny***, but at the same time, it provides more flexibility in
application design. It is assumed that developers are familiar with HTTP
protocol, HTML, and the JavaScript language, in order to develop such
web applications.

Function `startweb.esttest` will be described in this section. This
function takes no arguments and returns no results, its task is to start
a web interface for length estimation and hypothesis testing (Figure
[4](#fig:web-esttest)).

![Figure 4: Web interface for length estimation and hypothesis testing.

estimate its intima media thickness (darker layer below artery
cavity).](screencapture-startweb-esttest.png){#fig:web-esttest
width="100%" alt="graphic without alt text"}

To start the analysis using the web interface the picture in JPG format
should be loaded (*Load Picture* button). Then, a line should be drawn
that intersects the object of interest by clicking on two points in the
picture - length estimation will be performed on that line. Finally,
parameters for a data set preparation should be set.

The `Levels of gray` parameter determines how many levels of grey the
algorithm should take into account. It is important to mention that,
although color images can be loaded, they are internally converted to
grey-scales prior to any calculations. Since JPG format supports
$2^{24}$ different colors, the number of possible colors should be
reduced in order to optimize estimation speed and memory consumption.

`Line thickness` specifies how many picture pixels around the drawn line
are taken into account in length estimation. For instance, if
`Line thickness` is set to $3$, the algorithm takes pixels which are
direct left neighbours of the line, pixels on the line itself, and the
ones which are direct right neighbours of the line. By doing so, the
matrix of (length of the line) $\times$ `Line thickness` pixels --
*PixelMatrix* is obtained.

By doing so, we have obtained the matrix of (length of the line)
$\times$ `Line thickness` pixels -- *PixelMatrix*.

By clicking on the *Prepare data* button the data set will be prepared
for the inference.

The following step deals with data preparation and is a crucial step of
the algorithm. Each pixel of *PixelMatrix* is mapped to a new matrix of
`Box size` $\times$ `Box size` booleans -- *DotMatrix* (note that
`Box size` is a parameter). Further, every *DotMatrix* is filled with
uniformly distributed dots (i.e., `TRUE` values) in a way that total
number of dots in each *DotMatrix* corresponds to the brightness of the
pixel it represents. Then, *DotMatrices* are tiled up with respect to
the position of corresponding pixel and, by doing so, a new matrix of
(length of the line $\cdot$ `Box size`) $\times$ (`Line thickness`
$\cdot$ `Box size`) booleans is obtained -- *FinalDotMatrix*. The last
step is to summarize rows of the *FinalDotMatrix* to obtain a vector of
(length of the line) $\cdot$ `Box size` integers. The vector's histogram
is shown on a web interface (Figure [4](#fig:web-esttest), at the
bottom) and the vector itself serves as an input to the functions
`lengthest` or `lengthtest`.

Parameters in the *Estimation* section of the web interface are
transferred to `lengthest`, as well. After the user clicks on *Estimate*
button, `lengthest` is executed, and its results are displayed below the
picture. Additionally, the estimated uniform support is marked red on
the intersecting line.

Estimated length is expressed in width of a pixel and in percentage of
whole image's width as well. As stated in the info box, it is important
to use a proportional screen resolution on user's display, so the pixels
on the screen are square-shaped.

The *Testing* section of this web interface serves for hypothesis
testing. Procedures related to image loading, choosing an intersecting
line, and data preparation are the same as described above. For the
purpose of testing, values for `H0`, `unit`, and `alternative`
(`greater`, `less`, or `two-sided`) need to be specified. The part of
the web interface dealing with output of hypothesis testing procedure is
shown in Figure [5](#fig:web-test).

## Area estimation of an object shown in a picture

The function `startweb.area` starts a web interface for area estimation
(Figure [6](#fig:web-area)). Again, the first step is to load an image.
To select an object whose surface needs to be evaluated, a rectangle
should be drawn around it. It is done by clicking on its upper-left and
lower-right corners, after which a green rectangle is drawn on the
picture.

Data parameters are similar to ones in the length estimation web
interface, with the exception of `number of slices`.

The first step in the area estimation algorithm for this function is to
roughly isolate the object in the selected rectangle. In order to do
that, pixels from the selected rectangle are divided into two clusters
by using the `kmeans` function from base-R ***stats*** package (the
criterion for clustering is pixel brightness). Further, only pixels from
the 'object cluster' are observed and divided into horizontal and
vertical stripes, as described earlier in Algorithm
[1](#alg:areaest). The number of stripes is dictated by the
`number of slices` parameter. A length estimation procedure is conducted
on each stripe, obtaining two estimated edge points of the object for
each stripe (red dots in Figure [5](#fig:web-test)). Two parameters in
the *Estimation* section of the web interface are related to the length
estimation procedure of the stripes.

Finally, an optimal ellipse that fits into edge points is found using
`EllipseDirectFit` function from the ***conicfit*** package, as well as
in the `areaest` function described earlier. The resulting ellipse is
drawn in red in Figure [5](#fig:web-test). Its area is printed below,
this is measured in pixels and the percentage of the whole image area.

# Concluding remarks

The R package ***LeArEst*** provides routines for estimating the support
of the random variable $U,\,U\sim\mathcal{U}[-a,a],$ based on a sample
from $X=U+\varepsilon$. The random variable $\varepsilon$ represents
additive measurement error and is supposed to have either a normal,
Laplace, or scaled Student distribution with 5 degrees of freedom. The
package also includes functions for estimating either the borders or the
area of some object from a noisy image. The package may be useful for
this purpose mainly in the case of images with reasonable contrast
between the object of interest and background. For greater robustness,
we find it convenient to use some error distributions with heavier
tails. Sometimes we have different amounts of noise in the tails, so it
would be useful to include some asymmetric error distributions as well.
These are some features we are going to add in the package in order to
improve flexibility of our models.
