title: 'LeArEst: Length and Area Estimation from Data Measured with Additive Error'
abstract: 'This paper describes an R package LeArEst that can be used for estimating
  object dimensions from a noisy image. The package is based on a simple parametric
  model for data that are drawn from uniform distribution contaminated by an additive
  error. Our package is able to estimate the length of the object of interest on a
  given straight line that intersects it, as well as to estimate the object area when
  it is elliptically shaped. The input data may be a numerical vector or an image
  in JPEG format. In this paper, background statistical models and methods for the
  package are summarized, and the algorithms and key functions implemented are described.
  Also, examples that demonstrate its usage are provided. Availability: LeArEst is
  available on CRAN.'
