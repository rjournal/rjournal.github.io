title: Time-Series Clustering in R Using the dtwclust Package
abstract: Most clustering strategies have not changed considerably since their initial
  definition. The common improvements are either related to the distance measure used
  to assess dissimilarity, or the function used to calculate prototypes. Time-series
  clustering is no exception, with the Dynamic Time Warping distance being particularly
  popular in that context. This distance is computationally expensive, so many related
  optimizations have been developed over the years. Since no single clustering algorithm
  can be said to perform best on all datasets, different strategies must be tested
  and compared, so a common infrastructure can be advantageous. In this manuscript,
  a general overview of shape-based time-series clustering is given, including many
  specifics related to Dynamic Time Warping and associated techniques. At the same
  time, a description of the dtwclust package for the R statistical software is provided,
  showcasing how it can be used to evaluate many different time-series clustering
  procedures.
