# Introduction

Systematic reviews play a key role in the evaluation of new
interventions. While combining evidence from a number of studies should
reduce both bias and uncertainty, this is sometimes not the case because
published studies represent a biased selection of the evidence. This can
happen for a number of reasons, for example authors may be more likely
to submit trials with 'significant' results for publication or journals
may be more likely to publish smaller trials if they have 'significant'
results. Empirical studies have established evidence for these kinds of
biases and others
[@Roth:Sutt:Bore:publ:2005; @Niem:Rcke:Miet:Carp:Schu:stat:2007].

In consequence, considerable effort has been directed at the problem of
developing reliable tests for selection biases
[@Harb:Egge:Ster:modi:2005; @Rcke:Schw:Carp:arcs:2008], and in a second
step, correcting estimates for publication bias
[@Roth:Sutt:Bore:publ:2005]. One of the most promising methods to date
has been the so-called Copas selection
model [@Copa:what:1999; @Copa:Shi:meta:2000; @Copa:Shi:sens:2001], which
is derived from the Heckman 2-stage regression model (see
@Litt:Rubi:stat:2002).

Comprehensive evaluations suggest that this approach (i) can provide a
useful summary in around 80% of meta-analyses
[@Carp:Schw:Rcke:Knst:empi:2009] and (ii) is preferable to the
trim-and-fill method to adjust for bias in meta-analysis
[@Schw:Carp:Rcke:empi:2009]. This article describes the R package
[*copas*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=copas) for fitting and
interpreting the Copas selection model.

# Copas selection model

We first briefly describe the model. The Copas selection model has two
components: (i) a model for the outcome, measured on a chosen scale,
e.g. the log odds ratio, log risk ratio or the arcsine difference
[@Rcke:Schw:Carp:Olki:why:2009], and (ii) a 'selection' model giving the
probability that study $i$ is observed/published. A correlation
parameter $\rho$ between these two components models the extent of
selection/publication bias; the stronger the correlation, the greater
the chance that only more extreme outcomes are observed/published.

In more detail, let $(\epsilon_i,\delta_i)$ follow a bivariate normal
distribution with mean 0 and covariance matrix
$$\begin{pmatrix} 1& \rho \\ \rho & 1 \end{pmatrix}.$$ Denote the
underlying population intervention effect by $\theta,$ and between study
heterogeneity variance $\tau^2.$ For each study $i$ in a meta-analysis,
let $\hat\theta_i$ denote the estimate of $\theta$ and $s^2_i$ the
estimated variance of $\hat\theta_i,$ whose true, unobserved, variance
is $\sigma^2_i.$ We model the observed outcome of study $i$ using the
usual random effects model, i.e. as

$$\label{eq:copasa}
   \hat{\theta}_i = \theta + \sqrt{(\tau^2+\sigma^2_i)} \epsilon_i  (\#eq:copasa)  $$

and say study $i$ is observed/published if $Z_i>0,$ where

$$\label{eq:copasb}  
  	Z_i =\gamma_0 + \gamma_1/s_i + \delta_i  (\#eq:copasb)  $$

with fixed $\gamma_0$ and $\gamma_1$. From (\@ref(eq:copasb)), the
marginal probability that study $i$ is observed is
$$\begin{aligned}
  \label{eq:marobs}\Pr(Z_i>0) &= \Pr(\delta_i > -\gamma_0 -\gamma_1/s_i) \\
  &= \Phi(\gamma_0 + \gamma_1/s_i),
\end{aligned}  (\#eq:marobs)  $$ 

where $\Phi(\,.\,)$ is the cumulative
density function of the standard normal. Thus $\Phi(\gamma_0)$ can be
interpreted as the marginal probability of publishing a study with
infinite standard error, and $\gamma_1$ is associated with the change in
publication probability with increasing precision. Note that the
appearance of $s_i$ in (\@ref(eq:copasb)) means that the probability of
publication reflects the sampling variance of study $i$.

@Copa:what:1999 and @Copa:Shi:meta:2000 use standard properties of the
normal distribution to show that the probability of observing study $i$
is

$$\label{eq:pobstrial}
  \Phi \left\{
    \frac{ \gamma_0+\gamma_1/s_i + \rho \sigma_i (\hat{\theta}_i -  \theta)/(\sigma^2_i+\tau^2) }{\sqrt{1 - \rho^2\sigma^2_i/(\sigma^2_i+\tau^2)}}
  \right\}.  (\#eq:pobstrial)  $$

Thus if $\rho=0,$ (\@ref(eq:copasa)) and (\@ref(eq:copasb)) are
unrelated and a meta-analysis of observed studies will give an
approximately unbiased estimate of $\theta.$ Conversely, if large
$\theta$ means a strong treatment effect and $\rho > 0$, then the
probability of observing study $i$ is increased the larger
$\hat{\theta}_i.$ In this situation, a meta-analysis of observed studies
will give a biased estimate of $\theta.$

We have developed the R package
[*copas*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=copas) to provide a
comprehensive set of R functions for fitting the Copas selection model,
then printing and displaying the results. The R package
[*copas*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=copas) is an add-on package
to the R package [*meta*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=meta)
[@Schw:meta:2007]. To illustrate the use of the R package
[*copas*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=copas), consider a
meta-analysis of 9 studies comparing prophylactic maternal phenobarbital
with control for periventricular haemorrhage in preterm infants
[@Crow:Hend:phen:2003].

Figure [1](#figure:metabin) illustrates the analysis of these data,
which have a binary response (presence or absence of haemorrhage). After
reading the data in, we perform a meta-analysis on the odds-ratio scale
using function `metabin()` from the R package
[*meta*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=meta). Note the warning that
a continuity correction has been used, since one study has a zero cell.
By default, 0.5 is added only to cell counts of two-by-two tables with
zero cell frequencies. Two other stategies to adjust for zero cell
frequencies are implemented in the function `metabin()`
[@Schw:meta:2007]: (i) add 0.5 to all two-by-two tables in the case of
zero cell counts in one or more studies (`allincr = TRUE`), (ii) add 0.5
to all two-by-two tables irrespective of zero cell counts
(`addincr = TRUE`).

The random effects model suggests a significant intervention benefit (p
= 0.0006). Nevertheless, a funnel plot of the data (top left panel
Figure [2](#figure:plot.copas)) suggests effects may be systematically
larger in smaller studies. Investigating this with a statistical test
(function `metabias()`, Figure [1](#figure:metabin)) supports this
suspicion with $p=0.011.$

We therefore perform a Copas analysis, using the function `copas()`, as
shown in Figure [1](#figure:metabin). This fits the Copas selection
model repeatedly, by maximising the likelihood
[@Carp:Schw:Rcke:Knst:empi:2009] --- subject to the constraints that
$-1 < \rho < 1$ and $\tau^2 \geq 0$ --- over a grid of
$(\gamma_0,\gamma_1)$ values using the existing R function `optim()`
(L-BFGS-B method). We use transformations of $\rho$ and $\tau^2$ in the
log-likelihood to reduce numerical instability, which is a known issue
with this model [@Carp:Schw:Rcke:Knst:empi:2009]. We redo the Copas
analysis extending the range of values for $\gamma_0$ as the $P$-value
of residual selection bias is still significant using the default
settings. Three warning messages are printed concerning a parameter
`rho.tilde` which is used internally in likelihood estimation
[@Copa:Shi:meta:2000 p. 250]. Typically, these warnings can be safely
ignored. The function `plot.copas()` can be used as a diagnostic tool
(see Discussion).

An object of class `copas` is created which we can `print`, `summarise`
and `plot`. Figure [2](#figure:plot.copas) shows the result of function
`plot.copas()`, which by default displays four panels. The top left plot
is the usual funnel plot, which plots the study specific effect sizes
(here log odds ratios) against their standard error. The vertical broken
line is the usual fixed effect estimate of the treatment effect, while
the vertical grey line is the usual random effects estimate of the
treatment effect. Diagonal broken lines show $\pm$ 2 standard errors
about the fixed effect. If there is no heterogeneity or selection bias,
we would expect about 95% of studies to lie in this 'funnel'. In this
example, there is a suggestion that smaller studies tend to show a
stronger effect.

Given the range of study standard errors in the meta-analysis, the
function `copas()` chooses a range of $\gamma_0$ and $\gamma_1$ values
for the selection model (\@ref(eq:copasb)). These are chosen to
represent varying selection strength. Specifically, the probability of
publishing the study with the largest SE (often the smallest study)
ranges from around 0.3 to 1. In this example, the initial analysis
(Figure [1](#figure:metabin), with the default ranges for ($\gamma_0$,
$\gamma_1$)) has the lower bound for $\gamma_0$ at $-0.45,$ which just
stops short of the region where the degree of selection is sufficient to
explain the asymmetry in the funnel plot. We thus repeat the analysis
with a slightly larger range for $\gamma_0,$ and it is this second
analysis that is shown in Figure [2](#figure:plot.copas).

The function `copas()` fits the Copas selection model over a grid of (by
default 400) points. The top right panel produced by `plot.copas` shows
a contour plot of the resulting treatment estimates $(\hat\theta)$ over
the range of $(\gamma_0,\gamma_1)$ values. Contours are labeled with
values of $\hat\theta,$ (which can be specified by the user) in this
case $-0.6, -0.5, -0.4,\dots .$ The contour plot suggests that as
selection increases (i.e. as we move away from the top right) the
treatment estimate declines, but the contours are locally parallel. As
described in more detail in the Appendix of
@Carp:Schw:Rcke:Knst:empi:2009, in such cases the contour plot can be
summarised by looking at how the treatment estimate varies as selection
increases along a line orthogonal to the contours. Using an algorithm we
developed [@Carp:Schw:Rcke:Knst:empi:2009], this orthogonal line is
estimated and superimposed on the contour plot. The places where it
intersects with the contours are marked with an 'o'.

The lower two panels of Figure [2](#figure:plot.copas) use this
information to present an accessible summary of the Copas selection
model analysis. First, at each of the line/contour intersections marked
with an 'o' in the contour plot, the program calculates the probability
of publishing the trial with the largest SE. Then, in the lower left
panel this is plotted against the corresponding treatment estimate
($\pm$ its 95% confidence interval). In our example this shows that with
little or no selection, the treatment estimate is close to that obtained
by the usual random effects meta-analysis.[^1] As selection increases
(so studies with large SE's but smaller effect sizes are less likely to
make it into the meta-analysis) so the treatment estimate moves towards
the null value and the significance (indicated by the degree that the
95% confidence interval overlaps 0) decreases.

Finally, the bottom right panel attempts to answer the question of which
degree of selection is most plausible under the model; i.e. which
treatment estimates should we pay most attention to. It does this as
follows. For each degree of selection (summarised by the probability of
publishing the trial with the largest SE) the program calculates whether
the remaining asymmetry in the funnel plot is more than might be
expected by chance, and calculates a p-value to test this hypothesis.
These are then plotted against the corresponding degree of selection.
Degrees of selection corresponding to p-values above 0.1 (i.e. at this
degree of selection, no evidence of residual selection bias in the data)
are more plausible under the model; corresponding treatment estimates in
the bottom left panel are more plausible.

In this example, with no selection bias (left hand end of bottom left
panel) the p-value for residual selection bias in the data is $<0.1,$
suggesting the meta-analysis should not be interpreted at face value.
Rather, it is only when the probability of publishing the trial with the
largest SD is as low as 0.4 that the asymmetry seen in the funnel plot
is explained. In this case, the bottom left panel indicates the
treatment effect is no longer significant at the 5% level. The function
`summary.copas()` (Figure [1](#figure:metabin)) complements this with a
numerical summary.

The Copas selection model analysis therefore suggests that after
accounting for selection bias and/or other small study effects, there is
no evidence of a benefit of the intervention. This agrees with the
authors of the original study, who comment that the two largest trials
--- which are of higher quality --- show no benefit, and conclude
"evidence does not support phenobarbital treatment to women giving birth
before 34 weeks to decrease the risk of bleeding into the babies'
brains".

## Arguments of function `copas()`

Although the majority of studies can be analysed automatically using the
Copas selection model this is not always true. Some analyses will
require fine tuning. The following options are available:

-   `gamma0.range`, `gamma1.range`:\
    These allow users to control the grid of $(\gamma_0,\gamma_1)$
    values in the selection part of the Copas selection model (equation
    \@ref(eq:copasb)) which the program ranges over to produce the
    contour plot (top right panel Figure [2](#figure:plot.copas)).

-   `ngrid`:\
    This parameter controls how fine the grid of $(\gamma_0, \gamma_1)$
    is. The `copas` function fits the Copas selection model over a grid
    of `ngrid`$\times$`ngrid` values.

-   `levels`:\
    Fitting the Copas model over the grid specified by the arguments
    `gamma0.range`, `gamma1.range` and `ngrid` results in a treatment
    estimate at every point in the grid. These are then displayed on a
    contour plot where contours of treatment effect (z-axis) are shown
    by gamma0 (x-axis) and gamma1 (y-axis). This argument is a numeric
    vector which specifies the treatment effects for which contour lines
    will be drawn.

-   `left`:\
    A logical indicating whether the cause of any selection bias is due
    to missing studies on the left or right of the funnel plot: left
    hand side if `left = TRUE`, right hand side if `left = FALSE`. This
    information is needed in order to be sure the test for presence of
    residual selection bias is calculated correctly.

-   `rho.bound`:\
    A number giving the upper bound for the correlation parameter $\rho$
    in the Copas selection model. The default is $0.9999.$ At this
    value, warnings are sometimes triggered by the program attempting to
    take the square root of numbers that are just negative; in all
    analyses we have carried out these can safely be ignored.
    Alternatively, repeat the analysis with a slightly smaller bound.
    Values less than 0.95 are likely to cause irregularites in regions
    of the contour plot where there is a high degree of selection.

-   `silent`:\
    A logical indicating whether information on progress in fitting the
    Copas selection model should be printed: `silent = TRUE` specifies
    not to print information (the default).

-   `warn`:\
    A number setting the handling of warning messages. It is not
    uncommon for numerical problems to be encountered during estimation
    over the grid of ($\gamma_0$, $\gamma_1$) values. Usually this does
    not indicate a serious problem. This option specifies what to do
    with warning messages --- `warn = -1`: ignore all warnings;
    `warn = 0` (the default): store warnings till the function finishes;
    if there are less than 10, print them, otherwise print a message
    saying warning messages were generated; `warn = 1`: print warnings
    as they occur; `warn = 2`: stop the function when the first warning
    is generated.

All the information used to generate the plots is available as
attributes of the object created by the `copas` function. Thus
tailor-made versions of the panels in Figure [2](#figure:plot.copas) can
be created by users without any further calculation.

Finally, the `summary` function and the `plot` function allow the user
to specify the confidence level.

# Discussion

The extensive literature on selection bias in meta-analysis (see
@Roth:Sutt:Bore:publ:2005 and references therein) reflects the
importance to the community of systematic reviewers of detecting, and
where possible adjusting for, selection bias. The Copas selection
model is a key tool for doing this [@Carp:Schw:Rcke:Knst:empi:2009]
(alongside other methods such as the trim-and-fill method included in
the [*meta*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=meta) package
[@Schw:meta:2007]).

An empirical evaluation of 157 meta-analyses with 4 to 66 studies showed
that our implementation of the Copas selection model provided a useful
summary in about 80% of meta-analyses [@Carp:Schw:Rcke:Knst:empi:2009].
In the remaining meta-analyses (i) the contour plot did not show roughly
parallel contour lines, (ii) the 95% confidence intervals in the
treatment effect plot did not vary smoothly, or (iii) $P$-values in the
$P$-value plot for residual selection bias were erratic. A contour plot
without roughly parallel contour lines did appear in situations with an
apparently symmetric funnel plot, i.e. when there was no indication of
selection bias. This is not a weakness of the model or the software but
a consequence of the flat likelihood and the treatment effect being
invariant in this situation. Irregularities in the treatment effect plot
and $P$-value plot are typically due to estimation problems. In general,
problems in the estimation process can be judged by looking at the
output from function `plot.copas()` which should be used routinely as a
diagnostic tool.

We have attempted to make the help files for the
[*copas*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=copas) package accessible
to systematic reviewers, who in most cases are likely to be new users of
R. With this package, we therefore believe that R has a powerful toolkit
for systematic reviewers.
