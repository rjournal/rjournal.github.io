title: 'MVN: An R Package for Assessing Multivariate Normality'
abstract: Assessing the assumption of multivariate normality is required by many parametric
  mul tivariate statistical methods, such as MANOVA, linear discriminant analysis,
  principal component analysis, canonical correlation, etc. It is important to assess
  multivariate normality in order to proceed with such statistical methods. There
  are many analytical methods proposed for checking multivariate normality. However,
  deciding which method to use is a challenging process, since each method may give
  different results under certain conditions. Hence, we may say that there is no best
  method, which is valid under any condition, for normality checking. In addition
  to numerical results, it is very useful to use graphical methods to decide on multivariate
  normality. Combining the numerical results from several methods with graphical approaches
  can be useful and provide more reliable decisions. Here, we present an R package,
  MVN, to assess multivariate normality. It contains the three most widely used multivariate
  normality tests, including Mardia’s, Henze-Zirkler’s and Royston’s, and graphical
  approaches, including chi-square Q-Q, perspective and contour plots. It also includes
  two multivariate outlier detection methods, which are based on robust Mahalanobis
  distances. Moreover, this package offers functions to check the univariate normality
  of marginal distributions through both tests and plots. Furthermore, especially
  for non-R users, we provide a user-friendly web application of the package. This
  application is available at http://www.biosoft.hacettepe.edu.tr/MVN/.
