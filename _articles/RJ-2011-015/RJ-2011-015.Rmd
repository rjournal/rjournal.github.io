title: 'Ckmeans.1d.dp: Optimal k-means Clustering in One Dimension by Dynamic Programming'
abstract: The heuristic k-means algorithm, widely used for cluster analysis, does
  not guarantee optimality. We developed a dynamic programming algorithm for optimal
  one-dimensional clustering. The algorithm is implemented as an R package called
  Ckmeans.1d.dp. We demonstrate its advantage in optimality and runtime over the standard
  iterative k-means algorithm.
