# Introduction

Cluster analysis offers a useful way to organize and represent complex
data sets. It is used routinely for data analysis in fields such as
bioinformatics. The $k$-means problem is to partition data into $k$
groups such that the sum of squared Euclidean distances to each group
mean is minimized. However, the problem is NP-hard in a general
Euclidean space, even when the number of clusters $k$ is $2$
[@R:Aloise+Deshpande+Hansen+Popat:2009; @R:Dasgupta+Freund:2009], or
when the dimensionality is $2$ [@R:Mahajan+Nimbhorkar+Varadarajan:2009].
The standard iterative $k$-means algorithm [@R:Lloyd:1982] is a widely
used heuristic solution. The algorithm iteratively calculates the
within-cluster sum of squared distances, modifies group membership of
each point to reduce the within-cluster sum of squared distances, and
computes new cluster centers until local convergence is achieved. The
time complexity of this standard $k$-means algorithm is $O(qknp)$, where
$q$ is the number of iterations, $k$ is the number of clusters, $n$ is
the sample size, and $p$ is the dimensionality
[@R:Manning+Raghavan+Schtze:2008].

However, the disadvantages of various heuristic $k$-means algorithms in
repeatability, optimality, and runtime may limit their usage in medical
and scientific applications. For example, when patients are clustered
according to diagnostic measurements on expression of marker genes, it
can be critical that a patient consistently falls into a same diagnostic
group to receive appropriate treatment, regardless of how many times the
clustering is applied. In this case, both cluster repeatability and
optimality are important. The result of heuristic $k$-means clustering,
heavily dependent on the initial cluster centers, is neither always
optimal nor repeatable. Often one restarts the procedure a number of
times to mitigate the problem. However, when $k$ is big, the number of
restarts for $k$-means to approach an optimal solution can be
prohibitively high and may lead to a substantial increase in runtime. As
clustering is often a preprocessing step in data analysis or modeling,
such inadequacy can pose a nuisance for further steps.

In response to this challenge, our objective is to develop a practical
and convenient clustering algorithm in R to guarantee optimality in a
one-dimensional (1-D) space. The motivation originated from discrete
system modeling such as Boolean networks
[@R:Kauffman:1969; @R:Kauffman:1993] and generalized logical networks
[@R:Song+Lewis+Lance+Chesler+Yordanova+Langston+Lodowski+Bergeson:2009],
where continuous values must be converted to discrete ones before
modeling. Our algorithm follows a comparable dynamic programming
strategy used in a 1-D quantization problem to preserve probability
distributions [@R:Song+Haralick+Robert+Boissinot:2010], the segmented
least squares problem and the knapsack problem
[@R:Kleinberg+Tardos:2006]. The objective function in the $k$-means
problem is the sum of squares of within-cluster distances. We present an
exact dynamic programming solution with a runtime of $O(n^2 k)$ to the
1-D $k$-means problem.

We implemented the algorithm in the R package
[*Ckmeans.1d.dp*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=Ckmeans.1d.dp)
[@R:Song+Wang:2011] and evaluated its performance by simulation studies.
We demonstrate how the standard $k$-means algorithm may return unstable
clustering results, while our method guarantees optimality. Our method
is implemented in C++ to take advantage of the practical speedup of a
compiled program. This C++ implementation is further wrapped in an R
package so that it can be conveniently called in R.

# Optimal 1-D clustering by dynamic programming

We first define the $k$-means problem. Let $x_1, \ldots ,x_n$ be an
input array of $n$ numbers sorted in non-descending order. The problem
of 1-D $k$-means clustering is defined as assigning elements of the
input 1-D array into $k$ clusters so that the sum of squares of
within-cluster distances from each element to its corresponding cluster
mean is minimized. We refer to this sum as within-cluster sum of
squares, or *withinss* for short.

We introduce a dynamic programming algorithm to guarantee optimality of
clustering in 1-D. We define a sub-problem as finding the minimum
*withinss* of clustering $x_1, \ldots, x_i$ into $m$ clusters. We record
the corresponding minimum *withinss* in entry $D[i,m]$ of an $n+1$ by
$k+1$ matrix $D$. Thus $D[n,k]$ is the minimum *withinss* value to the
original problem. Let $j$ be the index of the smallest number in cluster
$m$ in an optimal solution to $D[i,m]$. It is evident that $D[j-1,m-1]$
must be the optimal *withinss* for the first $j-1$ points in $m-1$
clusters, for otherwise one would have a better solution to $D[i,m]$.
This establishes the optimal substructure for dynamic programming and
leads to the recurrence equation
$$D[i,m] = \min_{m\leq j\leq i} \left\{ D[j-1,m-1] + d(x_j, \ldots ,x_i) \right\}, \\ 1 \le i \le n, 1 \le m \le k$$
where $d(x_j, \ldots ,x_i )$ is the sum of squared distances from
$x_j, \ldots ,x_i$ to their mean. The matrix is initialized as
$D[i,m] = 0$, when $m=0$ or $i=0$.

Using the above recurrence, we can obtain $D[n,k]$, the minimum
*withinss* achievable by a clustering of the given data. In the
meanwhile, $D[n,m]$ gives the minimum *withinss* if all $n$ numbers are
clustered into $m$ groups. By definition each entry requires $O(n^2)$
time to compute using the given recurrence if $d(x_j, \ldots ,x_i)$ is
computed in linear time, resulting in $O(n^3 k)$ total runtime. However,
$d(x_j, \ldots,
x_i)$ can be computed in constant time in the recurrence. This is
possible because $d(x_j, \ldots ,x_i )$ can be computed progressively
based on $d(x_{j+1},...,x_i)$ in constant time. Using a general index
from $1$ to $i$, we iteratively compute $$\begin{aligned}
d(x_1, \ldots ,x_i) &= d(x_1, \ldots ,x_{i-1}) + \frac{i-1}{i}(x_i-\mu_{i-1})^2 \\
\mu_{i} &= \frac{x_i + (i-1)\mu_{i-1}}{i} 
\end{aligned}$$ where $\mu_{i}$ is the mean of the first $i$ elements.
This iterative computation of $d(x_j, \ldots ,x_i)$ reduces the overall
runtime of the dynamic programming algorithm to $O(n^2 k)$.

To find a clustering of data with the minimum *withinss* of $D[n,k]$, we
define an auxiliary $n$ by $k$ matrix $B$ to record the index of the
smallest number in cluster $m$: $$\begin{gathered}
B[i,m] = \underset{m \leq j \leq i}{\operatorname{argmin}}\left\{ D[j-1,m-1] + d(x_j, \ldots ,x_i) \right\}, \\ 1 \le i \le n, 1 \le m \le k
\end{gathered}$$ Then we backtrack from $B[n,k]$ to obtain the starting
and ending indices for all clusters and generate an optimal solution to
the $k$-means problem. The backtrack is done in $O(k)$ time.

The space complexity of the dynamic programming is $O(n k)$ because we
use an $(n+1)\times (k+1)$ matrix $D$ to record minimum *withinss* and
an $n\times k$ matrix $B$ for backtracking.

## Implementation

We implemented this dynamic programming algorithm and created an R
package
[*Ckmeans.1d.dp*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=Ckmeans.1d.dp). To
take advantage of the runtime speed up by a compiled language over R, an
interpreted language, we developed the dynamic programming solution in
C++. We compiled the C++ code to a binary dynamic library, which can be
called within R through function `Ckmeans.1d.dp()` provided in the
package.

# Performance evaluation and comparison with the standard $k$-means

## Simulated data sets

We simulated data sets containing clusters using 1-D Gaussian mixture
models. In a Gaussian mixture model, the number of components is the
true number of clusters. The mean of each Gaussian component is randomly
sampled from the uniform distribution from $-1$ to $1$ and the standard
deviation of a component is uniformly distributed from $0$ to $0.2$.

## Optimality

We first compared the optimality of `Ckmeans.1d.dp()` and the standard
$k$-means method on 1-D data. We used the @R:Hartigan+Wong:1979
implementation of $k$-means, as provided by the `kmeans()` function in
R. The core of the `kmeans()` function is also implemented in C/C++. As
`Ckmeans.1d.dp()` guarantees optimality of clustering, we define the
relative difference from the `kmeans()` clustering result to the optimal
value produced by `Ckmeans.1d.dp()` as
$$\frac{withinss (\texttt{k-means}) - withinss (\texttt{Ckmeans.1d.dp})}{withinss (\texttt{Ckmeans.1d.dp})}$$
which measures deviation of the $k$-means result from the optimal value.

The data sets were randomly generated from Gaussian mixture models with
$2$ to $50$ components. We ran `Ckmeans.1d.dp()` and `kmeans()` on input
data given the correct number of clusters $k$. The relative difference
in *withinss* from the `kmeans()` to the optimal value produced by
`Ckmeans.1d.dp()` is shown as a function of $k$ in
FigureÂ [1](#fig:accuracy).

Although one hopes to get better clusters by restarting $k$-means
several times, the simulation suggests that it still cannot guarantee
optimality when there are many clusters in the data. This clearly
demonstrates the advantage of `Ckmeans.1d.dp()` in optimality.

## Runtime

We then compared the empirical runtime of `Ckmeans.1d.dp()` with the
standard $k$-means method on 1-D data. Using 1-D Gaussian mixture
models, we generated five input arrays of size $100$, $1,000$, $10,000$,
$100,000$, and $1,000,000$, respectively. The Gaussian mixture models
had $2$ to $50$ components.

![Figure 1: The accuracy of kmeans() becomes worse as the number of
clusters increases. Accuracy is indicated by the relative difference in
withinss from kmeans() to the optimal value returned by Ckmeans.1d.dp().
The input data sets of size 10,000 were sampled from Gaussian mixture
models of 2 to 50 components. kmeans() was set to restart 20 times for
each data set. ](AccuracyComparasion.png){#fig:accuracy width="100%" alt="graphic without alt text"}

We ran both programs on each input array ten times to obtain average
empirical runtimes in three different settings. All simulations were run
on a desktop computer with an Intel Core i7 860 processor and 8GB
memory, running OpenSUSE 11.3 and R 2.11.1.

In the first setting (FigureÂ [2](#fig:RuntimeDiffSize)), runtime is
obtained as a function of input data size from $100$ to $1,000,000$ for
both `Ckmeans.1d.dp()` and `kmeans()` without constraints on optimality.
The number of components in the Gaussian mixture models is fixed to $2$.

According to FigureÂ [2](#fig:RuntimeDiffSize), as the input size
increases, the runtime of `Ckmeans.1d.dp()` increases faster than the
runtime of `kmeans()`. However, the result returned by `kmeans()` may
not be optimal (the restart of `kmeans()` was set to 1). Without any
constraints on optimality, `kmeans()` demonstrates an advantage in
runtime over `Ckmeans.1d.dp()` of runtime quadratic in $n$.

In the second setting (FigureÂ [3](#fig:RuntimeDiffLevel_NoConverge)),
runtime is obtained as a function of number of clusters for
`Ckmeans.1d.dp()` and `kmeans()` without constraints on optimality. All
input data sets are of the same size $10,000$ and were generated from
Gaussian mixture models with $2$ to $25$ components.

In FigureÂ [3](#fig:RuntimeDiffLevel_NoConverge), the runtime of
`Ckmeans.1d.dp()` increases linearly with the number of clusters $k$, as
does the runtime of `kmeans()`. `kmeans()`, without any constraints on
optimality, still shows an advantage in absolute runtime over
`Ckmeans.1d.dp()`.

![Figure 2: Runtime as a function of input size for Ckmeans.1d.dp() and
kmeans(). kmeans() shows an advantage in runtime without any constraints
on optimality. The number of clusters is 2 and there is no restart for
k-means.](RuntimeOfDiffrentSize.png){#fig:RuntimeDiffSize width="100%" alt="graphic without alt text"}

![Figure 3: Comparison of runtime as a function of number of clusters
between Ckmeans.1d.dp() and kmeans(). The input data are mixed Gaussian
of fixed size 10,000 but with an increasing number of components,
representing the clusters in data. Although the k-means algorithm took
less runtime, it was run with no restart and thus may not be
optimal.](RuntimeOfDifferentClusterLevel_NotConverged.png){#fig:RuntimeDiffLevel_NoConverge
width="100%" alt="graphic without alt text"}

In the third setting (FigureÂ [4](#fig:RuntimeDiffLevel_Converge)), we
plot the runtime of `Ckmeans.1d.dp()` and `kmeans()` as a function of
the number of clusters, obtained from exactly the same input data in the
second setting, but with a constraint on the optimality of $k$-means
such that its *withinss* has a relative difference less than $10^{-6}$
from the optimal value.

![Figure 4: Runtime as a function of number of clusters with restart of
kmeans() to guarantee a relative difference less than $10^{-6}$ to the
optimal value. The sample size is always 10,000. The number next to each
blue square is the number of restarts needed for kmeans(). The runtime
of kmeans() appears to grow exponentially and that of Ckmeans.1d.dp()
always grows linearly with the number of
clusters.](RuntimeTillConverged.png){#fig:RuntimeDiffLevel_Converge
width="100%" alt="graphic without alt text"}

Since `Ckmeans.1d.dp()` returns an optimal result in only one run, its
runtime is the same as setting 2. On the other hand, `kmeans()` was
restarted a number of times in order to approach an optimal solution
within the given tolerance. The number of restarts increases
substantially to produce a nearly optimal solution as the number of
clusters $k$ increases. As shown in
FigureÂ [4](#fig:RuntimeDiffLevel_Converge), the runtime of
`Ckmeans.1d.dp()` increases linearly with $k$, but the runtime of
`kmeans()` appears to increase exponentially with $k$. The runtime of
`kmeans()` almost always far exceeds `Ckmeans.1d.dp()` when $k$ is above
$15$. This suggests an advantage of `Ckmeans.1d.dp()` over `kmeans()` in
both runtime and optimality when $k$ is big.

# Introduction to the R package [*Ckmeans.1d.dp*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=Ckmeans.1d.dp)

The [*Ckmeans.1d.dp*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=Ckmeans.1d.dp)
package implements the dynamic programming algorithm for 1-D clustering
that we described above. In the package, the `Ckmeans.1d.dp()` function
performs the clustering on a 1-D input vector using a given number of
clusters.

The following example illustrates how to use the package.
FigureÂ [5](#fig:example) visualizes the input data and the cluster
result obtained by `Ckmeans.1d.dp()` in this example.

``` r
	# a one-dimensional example 
	# with a two-component Gaussian mixture model
	x <- rnorm(50, mean = 1, sd = 0.3)
	x <- append(x, rnorm(50, sd = 0.3) )
	result <- Ckmeans.1d.dp(x, 2)
	plot(x, col = result$cluster)
	abline(h = result$centers, col = 1:2, pch = 8, 
       cex = 2)
```

# Summary

The main purpose of our work is to develop an exact solution to 1-D
clustering in a practical amount of time, as an alternative to heuristic
$k$-means algorithms. We thus developed the
[*Ckmeans.1d.dp*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=Ckmeans.1d.dp)
package using dynamic programming to guarantee clustering optimality in
$O(n^2 k)$ time. The algorithm is implemented in C++ with an interface
to the R language. It is provided as a package to R and has been tested
under recent operating system versions of Windows, Linux and MacOS. By
simulation studies, we demonstrated its advantage over the standard
$k$-means algorithm when optimality is required.

There are two limitations of our
[*Ckmeans.1d.dp*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=Ckmeans.1d.dp)
method. It only applies to 1-D data and its quadratic runtime in the
sample size may not be acceptable in all applications.

However, where applicable, the impact of our method is its optimality
and repeatability. As our simulation studies show, when the number of
clusters is big, our method not only guarantees optimality but also has
a fast runtime. In this situation, our method is preferred. We applied
our [*Ckmeans.1d.dp*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=Ckmeans.1d.dp)
to quantize biological data in the DREAM Challenges
[@R:Prill+Marbach+Saez-Rodriguez+Peter+Alexopoulos+Xue+Clarke+Altan-Bonnet+Stolovitzky:2010]
for qualitative dynamic modeling using generalized logical networks
[@R:Song+Lewis+Lance+Chesler+Yordanova+Langston+Lodowski+Bergeson:2009].

It is of great interest if the 1-D dynamic programming strategy can be
extended to multiple dimensional spaces so that clustering can be done
in polynomial time to $k$. However, this seems to us to remain open
indefinitely.
