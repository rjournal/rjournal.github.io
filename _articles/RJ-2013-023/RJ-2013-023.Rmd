title: RNetCDF - A Package for Reading and Writing NetCDF Datasets
abstract: This paper describes the RNetCDF package (version 1.6), an interface for
  reading and writing files in Unidata NetCDF format, and gives an introduction to
  the NetCDF file format. NetCDF is a machine independent binary file format which
  allows storage of different types of array based data, along with short metadata
  descriptions. The package presented here allows access to the most important functions
  of the NetCDF C-interface for reading, writing, and modifying NetCDF datasets. In
  this paper, we present a short overview on the NetCDF file format and show usage
  examples of the package.
