# Introduction

NetCDF is a widely used file format in atmospheric and oceanic research
-- especially for weather and climate model output -- which allows
storage of different types of array based data, along with a short data
description. The NetCDF format (Network Common Data Format,
<http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/netcdf/>) has been developed since
1988 by Unidata (a programme sponsored by the United States National
Science Foundation) with the main goal of making best use of atmospheric
and related data for education and research
[@rew_etal.2011.netcdf_413; @rew_davis.1990.ieee-cga_10].

NetCDF files are stored as machine-independent binary data, such that
files can be exchanged between computers without explicit conversion
[@rew_davis.1990.ieee-cga_10]. Until version 3.6.0, only one binary data
format was used. This is the default format for all NetCDF versions and
is also named NetCDF classic format [@rew_etal.2011.netcdf_413]. Version
3.6.0 of the NetCDF library introduced the 64-bit offset format, which
allowed addressing of much larger datasets; version 4.0.0 introduced
also the HDF5 format, in a way that the NetCDF library can use HDF5 as
its external format. By default, however, the classic format is still
used [@rew_etal.2011.netcdf_413].

One particular advantage of NetCDF over some other binary formats, such
as the RData format used by R, is the ability to access and modify
arbitrary sections of array data. This allows massive datasets to be
processed efficiently, even if they are larger than the virtual memory
available on a particular system. To reduce disk space requirements,
floating-point values are often packed into 8- or 16-bit integers, and
the NetCDF-4 (HDF5) format supports transparent compression using the
zlib library.

[*RNetCDF*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=RNetCDF)
[@michna.2012.pkg_rnetcdf] was designed to handle the classic format and
is also able to read and write files with 64-bit offset. If *RNetCDF* is
compiled and linked with version 4.0.0 or later of the NetCDF library,
files in NetCDF-4 (HDF5) binary format can be read if they use the data
model of NetCDF-3 or earlier. In this paper we give a short overview of
the concept of NetCDF based on Unidata's reference manuals, followed by
the concept of the package and usage examples.

# What are NetCDF datasets?

## Data model

A NetCDF dataset contains dimensions, variables, and attributes, each
identified both by a name and an ID number. These components can be used
together to capture the meaning of data and relations among data fields
in an array-oriented dataset. The NetCDF library allows simultaneous
access to multiple NetCDF datasets which are identified by dataset ID
numbers, in addition to ordinary file names.

A NetCDF dataset contains a symbol table for variables containing their
name, data type, rank (number of dimensions), dimensions, and starting
disk address. Each element is stored at a disk address which is a linear
function of the array indices (subscripts) by which it is identified.
Hence, these indices need not be stored separately (as in a relational
database). This provides a fast and compact storage method
[@rew_etal.2006.netcdf_361]. The advantage of the NetCDF library is that
there is no need for the user to take care of the physical
representation of multidimensional data on the disk.

## Data types

The NetCDF interface defines six primitive external data types --
`char`, `byte`, `short`, `integer`, `float`, and `double`
[@rew_etal.2006.netcdf_361]. Their exact representation is shown in
Table [1](#rnetcdf_table-data-types). These types were chosen to provide
a reasonably wide range of trade-offs between data precision and number
of bits required for each value. These external data types are
independent of whatever internal data types are supported by a
particular machine and language combination. The basic unit of named
data in a NetCDF dataset is a variable [@rew_etal.2006.netcdf_361]. When
a variable is defined, its shape is specified as a list of dimensions.
These dimensions must already exist at the time of definition of a
variable.

## Dimensions

A dimension may be used to represent a real physical dimension, for
example, time, latitude, longitude, or height. A dimension might also be
used to index other quantities, for example station or model-run-number
[@rew_etal.2006.netcdf_361].

A NetCDF dimension has both a name and a length, where the dimension
length is an arbitrary positive integer starting at 1. One dimension in
a NetCDF dataset can be of unlimited length. Such a dimension is called
the unlimited dimension or the record dimension. A variable with an
unlimited dimension can grow to any length along that dimension. The
unlimited dimension index is like a record number in conventional
record-oriented files. A NetCDF dataset can have at most one unlimited
dimension, but need not have any. If a variable has an unlimited
dimension, that dimension must be the most significant (slowest
changing) one.

## Variables

Variables are used to store the bulk of the data in a NetCDF dataset. A
variable represents an array of values of the same type. A scalar value
is treated as a 0-dimensional array. A variable has a name, a data type,
and a shape described by its list of dimensions specified when the
variable is created. A variable may also have associated attributes,
which may be added, deleted or changed after the variable is created
[@rew_etal.2006.netcdf_361]. The shape of a variable cannot be changed
after definition, only growing along the unlimited dimension is
possible. Missing values (NA) have no internal representation. For this
purpose, a respective attribute has to be defined for each variable.
Most applications (including *RNetCDF*) accept the names `_FillValue`
and `missing_value`, although the latter is deprecated and should not be
used when creating new datasets.

## Handling of strings

NetCDF does not have a primitive string type, but does have arrays of
type `char`, each of which is 8 bits in size. The main difference is
that strings are arrays of chars of variable length, while char arrays
are of fixed length [@rew_etal.2006.netcdf_361]. If an array of strings
has to be created (e.g., a list of station names), internal routines
read char arrays and convert them to strings without requiring the user
to deal with trailing zeroes or padding. The zero-byte termination of
strings is done automatically, and the user only needs to ensure that
the fastest varying dimension (often named `max_string_length`) is long
enough to contain the terminating zero-byte, i.e.,
`max(nchar(my_strings))+1` where `my_strings` is the data to be written.

## Attributes

NetCDF attributes are used to store metadata, similar in many ways to
the information stored in data dictionaries and schema in conventional
database systems. Most attributes provide information about a specific
variable. These are identified by the name (or ID) of that variable,
together with the name of the attribute. An attribute has an associated
variable (the null variable for global attributes), a name, a data type,
a length, and a value [@rew_etal.2006.netcdf_361]. Most generic
applications that process NetCDF datasets assume standard attribute
conventions (see below) and it is strongly recommended that these be
followed unless there are good reasons for not doing so.

## Naming conventions

There are almost no restrictions on how a NetCDF dataset should be named
and structured. However, there are different conventions like COARDS and
CF (<http://cf-pcmdi.llnl.gov/>, @eaton_etal.2011.cf_16), and it is
highly recommended to follow at least the basic practice to ensure
portability and self-description of the contents. Variable, dimension
and attribute names should begin with a letter and be composed of
letters (case significant), digits, and underscores. The CF-convention
(NetCDF Climate and Forecast Metadata Convention) permits neither the
use of the hyphen character, nor leading underscores in names. Finally,
NetCDF files should have the file name extension `.nc`.

## Coordinate systems

A coordinate variable is a one-dimensional variable with the same name
as a dimension, which names the coordinate values of the dimension. It
should not contain any missing data (for example, no `_FillValue` or
`missing_value` attributes) and must be strictly monotonic (values
increasing or decreasing). A variable's coordinate system is the set of
coordinate variables used by the variable. It is good practice to
respect the following rules [@rew_etal.2006.netcdf_361]:

-   Create coordinate variables for every dimension (except for string
    length dimensions).

-   Give each coordinate variable at least `unit` and `long_name`
    attributes to document its meaning.

-   Share dimensions to indicate that two variables use the same
    coordinates along that dimension. If two variables' dimensions are
    not related, create separate dimensions for them, even if they
    happen to have the same length.

In climatological applications, often geographical coordinates are used.
Variables representing latitude must always explicitly include the
`units` attribute; there is no default value. The recommended unit of
latitude is `degrees_north`, and `degrees_east` for longitude
[@eaton_etal.2011.cf_16].

## Handling of time

There is no single way to deal with time in NetCDF datasets, but in most
cases, time definitions from Unidata's UDUNITS library are used (see
<http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/udunits>). Variables representing
time must always explicitly include the `units` attribute; there is no
default value. The `units` attribute takes a string value formatted as
per the recommendations in the UDUNITS package [@eaton_etal.2011.cf_16],
usually in the form `time_units since time_reference`.

The most commonly used time units (and their abbreviations) include
`day`, `hour`, `minute` and `second` or their plural forms. The units
`year` and `month` may also be used, but they refer to fractional
numbers of days related to successive passages of the sun through the
vernal equinox. It may be preferable to use units related to the
calendar year, including a `common_year` of 365 days, a `leap_year` of
366 days, a `Julian_year` of 365.25 days, or a `Gregorian_year` of
365.2425 days.

A reference time string is required to appear after the identifier
`since`, and it may include date alone, date and time, or date, time and
time zone. An example of a valid reference time is
`1970-1-1 00:00:00 10:00`, which is midnight on January 1st, 1970 in a
time zone that is 10 hours east of Coordinated Universal Time (such as
Australian Eastern Standard Time).

# Implementation

*RNetCDF* enables most of the functionality of the NetCDF C-interface
(version 3.6.1) to be called from within R. Because time is often stored
as a numeric vector with a reference time and unit according to
Unidata's UDUNITS library, calendar conversion functions from UDUNITS
are also included in the package.

The programming interfaces provided by *RNetCDF* will be familiar to
developers who have used NetCDF from compiled languages such as Fortran
and C. An alternative package,
[*ncdf*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=ncdf)
[@pierce.2011.pkg_ncdf] and its successor
[*ncdf4*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=ncdf4)
[@pierce.2013.pkg_ncdf4], provides a higher-level interface to NetCDF
that may be preferred by some users, but it does not allow deleting and
renaming of attributes. However, the lower-level functions in *RNetCDF*
allow users to define functions and data structures that match their
purposes. Although a high-level interface generally requires less work
by users, we believe that *RNetCDF* provides more and better
functionality, since users need not care about technical issues at the C
level, yet they still have the means to perform nearly all operations
that are possible on NetCDF datasets. We have included one higher-level
function that is not part of the C-interface which enables reading of a
whole NetCDF dataset using one command, which is a common task when
working with such datasets.

All six of the external data types shown in
Table [1](#rnetcdf_table-data-types) are supported. However, when
reading data into R, only the R data types `character` and `numeric`
will be distinguished. The NetCDF C-library converts integer and
floating point values in a NetCDF file to double precision values in R,
and the reverse conversions are performed during write operations.
Reading and writing of data arrays is done by specifying a corner and a
vector of edge lengths. The capabilities of the package are restricted
to consecutive read/write; subsampling and mapping are not currently
supported by *RNetCDF* but they can be performed easily using standard R
commands.

The classic and 64-bit NetCDF file formats store metadata, such as
dimensions, variable names and attributes, in a binary header at the
start of the file. The contents of variables are stored after the
header, and little or no padding is used to separate the sections of the
file. If the metadata of the file are changed after variables are
written, it is likely that variables will need to be moved within the
file to accommodate a change in the size of the header. To avoid the
overhead of such data movement, the usual approach is to define all of
the metadata before writing data to variables. The NetCDF C-library uses
distinct modes for defining metadata and writing variables, and special
routines are used to switch between these two modes. However, for the
sake of simplicity, the mode-switching routines are hidden by the
*RNetCDF* interface, and the appropriate mode is selected for each
operation requested.

# Usage examples

## Creating a NetCDF dataset

As an example, assume we have a climatological dataset with daily
temperature measurements at five imaginary weather stations. Three
variables are defined: time (as date with year, month, day, hour,
minute, second), temperature and station name:

``` r
mytime        <- matrix(nrow=2, ncol=6)
mytime[1,]    <- c(2012, 06, 01, 12, 00, 00)
mytime[2,]    <- c(2012, 06, 02, 12, 00, 00)
mytime_units  <- "days since 1970-01-01 00:00:00"

mytemperature <- matrix(c(1.1, 2.2, 3.3, 4.4, 5.5, 6.6, 7.7, NA, NA, 9.9),
                        ncol=2, nrow=5)
myname        <- c("Alfa", "Bravo", "Charlie", "Delta", "Echo")
```

When creating the NetCDF dataset, the organisation of the data should be
known in advance. While changes to the structure of the file are
possible, they may involve significant reorganisation of data within the
file. To allow for expansion of a file with new data, it is possible to
declare a single dimension with "unlimited" size. As a first step in our
example, the file has to be created and all dimensions and variables
need to be defined:

``` r
nc <- create.nc("foo.nc")

dim.def.nc(nc, "station", 5)
dim.def.nc(nc, "time", unlim=TRUE)
dim.def.nc(nc, "max_string_length", 32)

var.def.nc(nc, "time", "NC_INT", "time")
var.def.nc(nc, "temperature", "NC_DOUBLE", c("station", "time"))
var.def.nc(nc, "name", "NC_CHAR", c("max_string_length", "station"))
```

At this point, missing values (NA) cannot be written and the time axis
is not yet defined. For this purpose, attributes have to be set and the
time matrix needs to be converted into a vector with a reference time
(as defined already above):

``` r
att.put.nc(nc, "temperature", "_FillValue", "NC_DOUBLE", -99999.9)
att.put.nc(nc, "time", "units", "NC_CHAR", mytime_units)

mytime_ut <- utinvcal.nc(mytime_units, mytime)
```

Now the variable data can be written. To ensure that the data are
written to the file and not buffered in memory, the file should be
closed when all operations are complete:

``` r
var.put.nc(nc, "name", myname)
var.put.nc(nc, "time", mytime_ut)
var.put.nc(nc, "temperature", mytemperature)
close.nc(nc)
```

If more data is to be added to the file in the same R session, the file
may be left open, but to avoid loss of data, it may be desirable to
force the flushing of buffers to disk using the function `sync.nc()` at
critical stages of a calculation.

In our example, the NetCDF dataset is written to disk with the absolute
minimum of required attributes. However, such a dataset is not really
self-describing and would not conform with any conventions. Therefore,
further attributes would need to be set. According to the CF-standard, a
variable should have at least the attributes `long_name` (e.g.,
`measured air temperature`), `units` (e.g., `degrees_celsius`), and
`standard_name` (e.g., `air_temperature`) (the latter is not needed for
the time coordinate variable). The possible values for `standard_name`
can be found in the CF conventions document. CF also requests the
indication of six global attributes, namely `title`, `history`,
`institution`, `source`, `comment`, and `references`. Although not
mandatory, it is recommended that NetCDF datasets comply with the CF or
any other standard, so that the contents of a file are described
unambiguously. If these rules are followed, NetCDF datasets can be
explored and processed using general-purpose software, and they can be
distributed or archived without any risk that the data in a file could
become separated from its description.

## Reading an existing NetCDF dataset

To show the contents of a NetCDF dataset, it must first be opened with
the `open.nc()` function. The `print.nc()` function displays an overview
of the dataset on standard output, giving the dimension definitions,
variable definitions including their attributes, and the contents of the
global attributes. For the example dataset created earlier, an overview
can be displayed as follows:

``` r
nc <- open.nc("foo.nc")
print.nc(nc)
```

The contents of a single variable can be read from a NetCDF dataset
using the `var.get.nc()` function. For a variable that contains a large
array of data, it may be desirable to read only an array section from
the variable, which can be accomplished by specifying a start index and
number of elements for each dimension of the array, as demonstrated
below. Notice that the optional `start` and `count` arguments are
vectors with one element for each dimension. Where the `count` argument
has a value of NA, the corresponding dimension is read in full.

``` r
mytemp <- var.get.nc(nc, "temperature", start=c(NA,2), count=c(NA,1))
```

The easiest way to read the contents of all variables from a NetCDF
dataset is by using the function `read.nc()`, which is available in
*RNetCDF* version 1.6 or later. This function returns a list with the
variables as named elements. Although this function has no equivalent in
the NetCDF C-interface, it has been added to *RNetCDF* to simplify a
common operation. For example, the contents of all variables can be read
from our example dataset and the `temperature` variable copied to
another variable using the following commands:

``` r
nc_data <- read.nc(nc)
mytemp  <- nc_data$temperature
```

Attributes can be read from variables that are identified by name or
number, and global attributes can be read using the special variable
name `NC_GLOBAL`. For example, conversion of relative times into
calendar times requires the `units` attribute from the `time` variable,
which may be read using the `att.get.nc()` function:

``` r
time_units <- att.get.nc(nc, "time", "units")
```

The NetCDF C-library provides a comprehensive set of functions to
determine the structure of a NetCDF dataset, including the names and
sizes of dimensions and variables. These functions can be used to write
programs that handle NetCDF datasets without prior knowledge of their
contents. Most of the inquiry functions of the C-library are accessible
through the *RNetCDF* functions `file.inq.nc()`, `dim.inq.nc()`,
`var.inq.nc()` and `att.inq.nc()`, which provide detailed information
about datasets, dimensions, variables and attributes, respectively. For
example, the names of all dimensions in a NetCDF dataset can be
determined as shown below. Note that NetCDF dimensions can be referenced
by integers that are sequential from 0; the same applies to variables
and attributes.

``` r
ndims    <- file.inq.nc(nc)$ndims
dimnames <- character(ndims)
for(i in seq_len(ndims)) {
    dimnames[i] <- dim.inq.nc(nc, i-1)$name
}
```

## Packed variables

To reduce the space required for storage of NetCDF datasets, the
CF-convention allows variables to be stored in a packed format. The
values are stored in a variable with lower precision than the original
data. For example, 32-bit floating point values are often converted to
16-bit integers, so that the file size is approximately halved. To
minimise the loss of information caused by the conversion, the original
values are shifted and scaled so that they span the range of the new
data type.

The packing algorithm can be expressed as follows:
$$\begin{aligned}
x_s &=& (\max{x}-\min{x})/(\max{y}-\min{y}) \\
x_o &=& \min{x}-x_s\min{y} \\
y &=& (x - x_o)/x_s,
\end{aligned}$$
where $x$ is the original data and $y$ is the packed variable. The
values of $x_o$ and $x_s$ are stored with the packed variable in the
standard attributes `add_offset` and `scale_factor`, respectively. These
attributes allow the packing operation to be reversed, although the
unpacked data will usually have less precision than the original values.

Versions 1.6 or later of *RNetCDF* provide options to convert packed
variables during reading and writing. Functions `var.get.nc()` and
`var.put.nc()` have optional arguments `unpack` and `pack` respectively,
although they have default values of `FALSE` to ensure compatibility
with previous versions. The newly released function *read.nc* also has
an optional `unpack` argument, which has the default value of `TRUE` to
provide easy access to most datasets. It should be noted that the `pack`
and `unpack` options are only honoured for variables that define both of
the attributes `add_offset` and `scale_factor`.

In the example considered previously, the temperature data could be
stored in a packed variable during creation of the dataset as follows:

``` r
var.def.nc(nc,"temp_p","NC_SHORT", c("station", "time"))
att.put.nc(nc, "temp_p", "_FillValue", "NC_SHORT", -32767)

tmax   <- max(mytemperature, na.rm=TRUE)
tmin   <- min(mytemperature, na.rm=TRUE)
ymax   <-  32766
ymin   <- -32766
scale  <- (tmax-tmin)/(ymax-ymin)
offset <- tmin-ymin*scale

att.put.nc(nc, "temp_p", "add_offset", "NC_DOUBLE", offset)
att.put.nc(nc, "temp_p", "scale_factor", "NC_DOUBLE", scale)
var.put.nc(nc, "temp_p", mytemperature, pack=TRUE)
```

## Calendar functions

The two calendar functions `utcal.nc()` and `utinvcal.nc()` of the
package (converting time from arbitrary units into a UTC-referenced date
and time, and vice versa) have the option to read/write date and time
directly in string form. When reading such strings, the structure must
be exactly `YYYY-MM-DD hh:mm:ss`.

``` r
> utcal.nc("days since 2012-01-01 00:00:00", c(0,1))

     year month day hour minute second
[1,] 2012     1   1    0      0      0
[2,] 2012     1   2    0      0      0
```

It is also possible to specify another timezone as the reference time,
as shown in the following example using Central European Time (CET):

``` r
> utcal.nc("days since 2012-01-01 00:00 +01:00", c(0,1))

     year month day hour minute second
[1,] 2011    12  31   23      0      0
[2,] 2012     1   1   23      0      0
```

If a user needs to have the date and time information as a string, the
`type` argument can be set appropriately:

``` r
> utcal.nc("days since 2012-01-01 00:00 +01:00", c(0,1), type="s")

[1] "2011-12-31 23:00:00" "2012-01-01 00:00:00"
```

This functionality is intended especially for extracting axis
descriptions in an efficient manner. Formatting of the string is
possible using R functions for strings. For example, `substr()` can be
used to extract the date or time components of the time-stamp.

# Summary and outlook

*RNetCDF* is an R interface to the NetCDF C-library. Most of the
functions provided by version 3 of NetCDF are accessible through
*RNetCDF* in a way that allows users to build functions easily for their
specific needs. Some higher-level features for frequently used
operations are provided by *RNetCDF*, such as automatic support for
missing values and packed variables and the ability to read all
variables into an R list. Calendar conversion functions from Unidata's
UDUNITS library are also included in this package to simplify the
handling of time variables in NetCDF datasets.

Further information can be obtained in the *RNetCDF* reference manual
and help pages (available from CRAN), Unidata's documentation for NetCDF
(<http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/netcdf/docs/>) and UDUNITS
(<http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/udunits/>), and the CF
conventions documentation site (<http://cf-pcmdi.llnl.gov/documents/>).

The plans for future development include an option to read and write
POSIXt time variables, which are used by many R routines, with automatic
translation to and from the time format used in NetCDF datasets. The
next major update will include support for the extended data model of
NetCDF-4. However, a first analysis of the full NetCDF-4/HDF5 data model
revealed that it might be difficult to map user defined data types
(e.g., 6-bit structures) in a straight-forward way in R, so an intensive
analysis of the new data model and the requirements of R users will be
needed.

Readers who are interested in contributing to the development of
*RNetCDF* are invited to contact the authors.
