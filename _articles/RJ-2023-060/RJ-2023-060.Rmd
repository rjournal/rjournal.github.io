title: Variety and Mainstays of the R Developer Community
abstract: The thriving developer community has a significant impact on the widespread
  use of R software. To better understand this community, we conducted a study analyzing
  all R packages available on CRAN. We identified the most popular topics of R packages
  by text mining the package descriptions. Additionally, using network centrality
  measures, we discovered the important packages in the package dependency network
  and influential developers in the global R community. Our analysis showed that among
  the 20 topics identified in the topic model, *Data Import, Export, and Wrangling*,
  as well as *Data Visualization, Result Presentation, and Interactive Web Applications*,
  were particularly popular among influential packages and developers. These findings
  provide valuable insights into the R community.
