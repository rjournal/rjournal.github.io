title: 'CIMTx: An R Package for Causal Inference with Multiple Treatments using Observational
  Data'
abstract: ' [CIMTx](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=CIMTx) provides efficient and
  unified functions to implement modern methods for causal inferences with multiple
  treatments using observational data with a focus on binary outcomes. The methods
  include regression adjustment, inverse probability of treatment weighting, Bayesian
  additive regression trees, regression adjustment with multivariate spline of the
  generalized propensity score, vector matching and targeted maximum likelihood estimation.
  In addition, [CIMTx](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=CIMTx) illustrates ways
  in which users can simulate data adhering to the complex data structures in the
  multiple treatment setting. Furthermore, the [CIMTx](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=CIMTx)
  package offers a unique set of features to address the key causal assumptions: positivity
  and ignorability. For the positivity assumption, [CIMTx](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=CIMTx)
  demonstrates techniques to identify the common support region for retaining inferential
  units using inverse probability of treatment weighting, Bayesian additive regression
  trees and vector matching. To handle the ignorability assumption, [CIMTx](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=CIMTx)
  provides a flexible Monte Carlo sensitivity analysis approach to evaluate how causal
  conclusions would be altered in response to different magnitude of departure from
  ignorable treatment assignment. '
