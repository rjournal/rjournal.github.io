title: Variants of Simple Correspondence Analysis
abstract: This paper presents the R package *CAvariants* [@CAvariants]. The package
  performs six variants of correspondence analysis on a two-way contingency table.
  The main function that shares the same name as the package -- `CAvariants` -- allows
  the user to choose (via a series of input parameters) from six different correspondence
  analysis procedures. These include the classical approach to (symmetrical) correspondence
  analysis, singly ordered correspondence analysis, doubly ordered correspondence
  analysis, non symmetrical correspondence analysis, singly ordered non symmetrical
  correspondence analysis and doubly ordered non symmetrical correspondence analysis.
  The code provides the flexibility for constructing either a classical correspondence
  plot or a biplot graphical display. It also allows the user to consider other important
  features that allow to assess the reliability of the graphical representations,
  such as the inclusion of algebraically derived elliptical confidence regions. This
  paper provides R functions that elaborates more fully on the code presented in @behlom14.

# Introduction

Computational procedures for detecting the association between two or
more categorical variables are important aspects of statistical theory
and practice. In particular, correspondence analysis provides a quick
and simple graphical summary of how categories and variables are
associated with one another. The theoretical aspects of the analysis are
well documented in the statistical and allied disciplines; see, for
example, @ben73, @gre84, @leb84, @beh04a, @nis07, and @behlom14. Despite
the necessity for programs and functions that allow their user to
perform correspondence analysis, the availability for many of the varied
approaches is generally limited. Commercially available statistical
software, such as MATLAB, Minitab, SAS and SPSS provide a means of
carrying out correspondence analysis, although their procedures often
provide only the most basic of features as part of their output.
Generally nothing beyond the calculation of principal inertia values,
profile coordinates, contribution to inertia and a two-dimensional
correspondence plot are provided. Other popular statistical languages,
such as R, provide some packages for performing simple and multiple
correspondence analysis of the classical (symmetrical) type,
[@mur05; @nen07; @alb15; @del06; @del09a; @rin12; @kos15]. Nevertheless,
at present, no popular statistical packages provide functions to perform
ordered variants of symmetrical and non symmetrical correspondence
analysis.

# Overview of correspondence analysis in R {#s.2}

Since the mid 2000's the programming environment of R has proven to be
extremely popular in all areas of theoretical and applied statistics.
This is due in part to the free availability of the program from the
Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN; <http://CRAN.R-project.org/>),
the versatility of the coding environment and the ever increasing number
of packages that are now available on the CRAN.

Various R packages have received a great deal of attention for their
contribution to the computing of correspondence analysis (CA). One of
the first is the [*MASS*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=MASS)
package [@venrip99; @rip02]. It provides the user with a means of
performing simple and multiple correspondence analysis with the option
of including supplementary points onto a display. More recently the
[*ca*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=ca) package of @nen07 includes
functions for performing simple, multiple and joint correspondence
analysis using two and three dimensions for the graphical displays.
Supplementary points were incorporated into the R code of @mur05 while
the [*anacor*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=anacor) package of
@del09a allows the user to perform classical and canonical
correspondence analysis with missing values [@del06; @del09b]. Further,
one may refer to the `CA` or `MCA` functions in the
[*FactoMineR*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=FactoMineR) package by
@le08. For lexical tables, the `CaGalt` function incorporated into the
*FactoMineR* package by @kos15 may be used. Another recent package --
[*cabootcrs*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=cabootcrs) -- by @rin12
checks the reliability of association by superimposing onto a plot
bootstrap confidence regions. The
[*CAinterprTools*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=CAinterprTools)
package by @alb15 makes use of graphical features to enrich a visual
interpretation of CA results. Alternatively, @del09a prepared the
[*homals*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=homals) package for
performing Gifi's approach to correspondence analysis. As well also,
@niscla14 presented
[*dualScale*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=dualScale) package for
doing dual scaling (i.e., multiple correspondence analysis) of multiple
choice data. @bax10 and @alb15 provide a good overview of correspondence
analysis using R with an archaeological focus. Another R based package
that can be downloaded freely from CRAN is
[*ExPosition*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=ExPosition)
[@ExPosition]. It is written by Herve Abdi and his team and performs a
variety of different multivariate data analysis techniques, including
correspondence analysis and multiple correspondence analysis. Abdi's
group has also been responsible for other variations of correspondence
analysis including *multi-block discriminant correspondence analysis*
[@will10] and *discriminant correspondence analysis* [@abd07].
Furthermore, another suite of R functions that enables the user to
perform a variety of correspondence analysis techniques is
[*vegan*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=vegan) [@oks13], which was
developed primarily for vegetation ecologists. It includes functions
that provide the user with a large array of techniques to choose from
including classic correspondence analysis, canonical correspondence
analysis and detrended correspondence analysis. One may also consider
the [*ade4*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=ade4) package
[@draduf07; @che04; @thi97], which also includes non symmetric
correspondence analysis, to analyze ecological and environmental data in
the framework of numerous euclidean exploratory methods. Further, the
[*cncaGUI*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=cncaGUI) package
[@libwilvil15] allows canonical correspondence analysis and canonical
non symmetrical correspondence analysis providing inferential results by
using bootstrap methods. The
[*PTAk*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=PTAk) package includes
[@lei10; @lei15] functions for doing multiway data decomposition, and in
particular, it also allows simple correspondence analysis and a
generalization of correspondence analysis for $k$-way tables. Lastly,
but certainly not least, the R code of @mur05 for performing simple and
multiple correspondence analysis may also be considered.

An overview of the broad areas of correspondence analysis that these
packages cover is summarized in Table [1](#tab:pack). While non
symmetrical correspondence analysis for nominal variables is included in
some of the R packages on the CRAN that perform correspondence analysis,
the remaining ordered variants have not yet been made available in any R
package. However, fragments of R code for some of these CA variants are
available in @behlom14. Therefore, this paper provides a comprehensive
description of R code that enhances, beyond the classics, the type of
correspondence analysis that one may use. The advantages of these
variants is that they enable the user to incorporate categorical
predictor/response associations and the ordinal structure of a variable.
For ordered variables we can easily identify any linear and non-linear
sources of association that may exist in the data. The ordered variants
also provide a visualization of non-linear trends of association; the
classical approaches to correspondence analysis do not encompass these
features.

The theoretical aspects underlying all the six variants of
correspondence analysis considered in this paper can be found in
@behlom14 and @lom16. However, here we will provide the reader with a
brief overview of the theoretical aspects of these analyses. We also
describe how the algebraic confidence ellipses for polynomial biplots
can be derived; this aspect of the analysis has not been described
elsewhere.

# Some theory {#s.4}

## Symmetrical and non symmetrical correspondence analysis

Consider a two-way contingency table **N** of dimension $I\times J$ such
that it is a cross-classification of two variables consisting of $I$ row
categories and $J$ column categories, respectively. Denote the matrix of
the joint relative frequencies by
${\rm {\bf P}}=\left( {p_{ij} } \right)$ so that
$\sum_{i=1}^I {\sum_{j=1}^J {p_{ij} } =1}$. Let
$p_{i\bullet } =\sum_{j=1}^J {p_{ij}}$ and
$p_{\bullet j} =\sum\nolimits_{i=1}^I {p_{ij} }$ be the $i$th marginal
row proportion and the $j$th marginal column proportion, general
elements of the diagonal matrices, $\mathbf{D}_I$ and $\mathbf{D}_J$,
respectively.

There are many ways that correspondence analysis can be performed and
@nis07 [Chapter 2] provides an excellent overview of some of them. Here,
we present the chi-squared statistic expressed in terms of the weighted
sum-of-squares of the centered column profiles since this alternative
expression of $X^2$ is useful when comparing symmetrical correspondence
analysis with its non symmetrical variant. Therefore, consider the
chi-squared statistic of **N** which is defined as

$$\begin{aligned}
\label{eq.chisq}
X^2 =  n\sum_{i=1}^I \sum_{j=1}^J \frac{p_{\bullet j}}{p_{i\bullet }}\left(\frac{ p_{ij}}{p_{\bullet j}}-p_{i \bullet }\right)^2 = n\sum_{i=1}^I \sum_{j=1}^J \frac{p_{\bullet j}}{p_{i \bullet }} \pi_{ij}^2 \,,
\end{aligned}   (\#eq:eq-chisq)$$

where ${\bf \Pi} = \left(\pi_{ij} \right)$ is the $I \times J$ matrix of
centered column profiles. In this case, the weight matrices in $\Re^I$
and $\Re^J$ are defined by the elements of the matrices
$\mathbf{D}^{-1}_I$ and $\mathbf{D}_J$, respectively.

Suppose we now treat the column variable as a predictor variable and the
row variable as its response variable. When such an asymmetric
association structure exists between the two categorical variables one
may consider non symmetrical correspondence analysis
[@lau84; @dam89; @kro99]. To quantify this asymmetric association,
consider the Goodman-Kruskal (1954) tau index

$$\begin{aligned}
\tau=\frac{\sum_{i=1}^I\sum_{j=1}^Jp_{\bullet j}\left (\frac{p_{ij}}{p_{\bullet j}}-p_{i\bullet} \right )^2 }{1-\sum_{i=1}^Ip_{i\bullet}^2} = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^I\sum_{j=1}^J p_{\bullet j} \pi_{ij}^2}{1-\sum_{i=1}^Ip_{i\bullet}^2} = \frac{\tau_{num}}{\tau_{den}} \, .
\end{aligned}$$

For this asymmetric case, the weight matrices are $\mathbf{I}$ (an
$I \times I$ identity matrix) and $\mathbf{D}_J$ respectively. Notice
that the denominator can be treated as a constant term since it does not
depend on the predictor variable. For this reason it can be neglected
without losing any information about the structure of the association.
Therefore $\tau_{num}$ is the measure of association considered in non
symmetrical correspondence analysis.

In order to graphically depict the association or the prediction of the
rows given the columns in a low dimensional space, we may consider the
generalized singular value decomposition of the centered column matrix
$\bf{\Pi}$ using the suitable weight matrices [@kro99].

Suppose we consider a general framework for the symmetrical and non
symmetrical variants of CA [@lom16], that considers generic weight
matrices, ${\bf V}_I$ and ${\bf W}_J$, in $\Re^I$ and $\Re^J$. This
general framework may be defined by considering the weighted centered
column profile matrix

$${\bf \tilde \Pi} = {\bf V}^{1/2} {\bf \Pi} {\bf W}^{1/2}.$$

Therefore, symmetric (or classical) correspondence analysis may be
performed by considering ${\bf V} = {\bf D}^{-1}_I$ and
${\bf W} = {\bf D}_J$, while non symmetrical correspondence analysis is
defined when ${\bf V} = {\bf I}$ and ${\bf W} = {\bf D}_J$. Doing so
leads to the generalized singular value decomposition (GSVD) of
$$\begin{aligned}
\mathrm{GSVD}\left (\bf \tilde \Pi \right)={\bf A\Lambda B}^{T} \,.
\end{aligned}$$

where the right and left singular vectors are ${\bf A}(=a_{im})$ and
${\bf B}(=b_{jm})$, respectively. These quantities have the
orthonormality properties with metrics $\mathbf{D}_I^{-1}$ or
$\mathbf{I}$ (identity) (in $\Re^I$, depending on the symmetric or
asymmetric relationship between the rows and columns) and $\mathbf{D}_J$
(in $\Re^J$), respectively. As usual, the elements of the diagonal
matrix of singular values,
${\bf \Lambda} = \textrm{diag} \left(\lambda_m \right)$, are arranged in
descending order.

## Ordered symmetrical and non symmetrical correspondence analysis

When both variables are ordered, we adapt SVD by using basis vectors for
the row and column spaces by performing the bivariate moment
decomposition (BMD) on the matrix ${\bf \tilde \Pi }$. The BMD of
${\bf \tilde \Pi }$ is expressed as
$$\begin{aligned}
\mathrm{BMD}\left ({\bf \tilde \Pi }\right ) = \mathbf{\mathcal{A}} \mathbf{Z} \mathbf{\mathcal{B}}^T,
\label{eq.bmd}
\end{aligned}   (\#eq:eq-bmd)$$

where $\mathbf{\mathcal{A}}$ and $\mathbf{\mathcal{B}}$ are the row and
column polynomial matrices defined by @eme68, respectively, and
${\bf Z}$ is the matrix of the generalized correlations [@ray09]. The
construction of polynomials $\mathbf{\mathcal{A}}$ and
$\mathbf{\mathcal{B}}$ requires the specification of *a priori* scores,
$s_X\left(i \right)$ and $s_Y\left( j \right)$ (defined by `mi` and `mj`
in `CAvariants`, respectively), to reflect the ordinal structure of the
row and column variables. These polynomials are orthonormal with respect
to the weight matrices. For the analysis of nominal variables, when a
symmetrical association between the variables is considered, the weights
in $\Re^I$ and $\Re^J$ are $\mathbf D_I^{-1}$ and $\mathbf D_J$,
respectively. When an asymmetric association is considered, the weights
are given by $\mathbf I$ and $\mathbf D_J$, respectively.

When only one of the two variables consists of ordered categories,
rather than considering the BMD or the GSVD of $\mathbf{\tilde \Pi}$,
one may consider instead its hybrid decomposition (HD)
[@beh01; @beh08; @lom16]. This method of decomposition consists of
singular vectors for the nominal variable and orthogonal polynomials for
the ordered variable. Consider the case, as does the package
*CAvariants*, where the column variable consists of ordered categories
and the row variable consists of nominal categories. Then the HD of
$\mathbf{\tilde \Pi}$ takes the form
$$\label{eq.hd}
  \mathrm{HD}\left( \mathbf{\tilde \Pi}\right)= \mathbf{A Z}\mathbf{\mathcal{B}}^T \,,   (\#eq:eq-hd)$$

where $\mathbf{A}$ is the column matrix of singular vectors for the
nominal row categories and $\mathbf{\mathcal{B}}$ is the column matrix
of orthogonal polynomials for the ordered column categories. The generic
elements of $\mathbf{Z}$, ${z}_{mv}$, are the *hybrid* generalized
correlations; for further details on these elements see @behlom14 and
@lom16.

### Generalized correlations in ordered CA variants

The generalized correlation matrix, $\mathbf{Z}$, in the BMD of
$\mathbf{\tilde \Pi}$ reflects the various sources of association
between the variables and is derived using orthogonal polynomials
[@bes96; @beh97; @ray09]. For example, when the row and column scores
are defined as consecutive integers such that $s_X\left(i \right) = i$
for $i=1,\ldots,I$ and $s_Y\left( j \right) = j$ for $j=1,\ldots,J$,
then $z_{11}$ is Pearson's product moment correlation of $\bf{N}$. A
simple generalization of this correlation is $z_{12}$ which is a measure
of the correlation between any change in the location of the row
categories and dispersion of the column categories. For this reason,
$z_{12}$ is a generalized correlation describing the linear-by-quadratic
association between the row and column categories.

For ordered CA variants, the total inertia is
$$\textrm{Inertia} \left(\mathbf {\tilde \Pi} \right)= \sum_{u=1}^{I-1} \sum_{v=1}^{J-1} z_{uv}^2,$$
which can also be written in matrix form as
$$\begin{aligned}
\textrm{Inertia} \left(\mathbf {\tilde \Pi} \right) = \textrm{trace} \left( \mathbf{Z}^T \mathbf{Z} \right) = \textrm{trace} \left( \mathbf{Z} \mathbf{Z}^T \right)= \textrm{trace}\left(\mathbf{\Lambda}^2\right).
\label{eq.ZZ}
\end{aligned}   (\#eq:eq-ZZ)$$
From the matrix of generalized correlations $\mathbf{Z}$, we can obtain
the inertia of each polynomial axis by considering the sum-of-squares of
$z_{uv}$ over either $u$ or $v$. Using BMD or HD, the symmetric and
asymmetric measures of association ($X^2$ and $\tau$) can be partitioned
into polynomial components that reflect various sources of variation for
each of the categories. The inertias of the polynomial components will
henceforth be referred to as *sources of inertia* and are akin to the
principal inertia values in (symmetrical or non symmetrical)
correspondence analysis.

A formal statistical test of the $X^2$ or $\tau$ index can be made. To
test the statistical significance of the total inertia in the
symmetrical and non symmetrical case, we can compare the chi-squared
statistic, or the C-statistic,
$C = \tau\cdot \left(n-1\right)\cdot\left(I-1\right)$ [@lig71], with the
$\chi^2$ distribution with $(I-1)(J-1)$ degree of freedom; see, for
example, @behlom14 for further details.

#### Unequal inertias of the row and column polynomials. {#unequal-inertias-of-the-row-and-column-polynomials. .unnumbered}

When considering the BMD of $\mathbf{\tilde \Pi}$, the total inertia of
the row and column spaces ($\Re^I$ and $\Re^J$, respectively) will be
identical. However, the inertia associated with each of the row and
column polynomials will often be different. For the row categories,
there are $I-1$ row inertia values -- one for each of the axes -- where
the inertia of the $u$th polynomial axis is $z^2_{u \bullet}$.
Similarly, there are $J-1$ column inertia values -- one for each of the
axes -- where the inertia of the $v$th axis is $z^2_{\bullet v}$. For
this reason, we recommend constructing polynomial biplots for the
ordered variants of correspondence analysis instead of the traditional
correspondence plots constructed using principal coordinates. See
@behlom14 and @lom16 for more details on these features.

For the HD of $\mathbf{\tilde \Pi}$, the interpretation and properties
of the $\mathbf{{Z}}$ matrix are a mixture (or hybrid) of
$\mathbf{\Lambda}$ from the GSVD and $\mathbf{Z}$ from the BMD. When
considering the space $\Re^J$, calculating
$\sum_{m=1}^{M^*} {z}^2_{m1}={z}^2_{\bullet 1}$ gives the location
component of the ordered columns and represents the principal inertia
for this variable along the first polynomial axis. Similarly in $\Re^I$,
computing $\sum_{v=1}^{J-1} {z}^2_{1v}={z}^2_{1\bullet }=\lambda^2_1$
yields the principal inertia of the first principal axis for the nominal
row variable. Like BMD, HD yields different sets of inertia values for
each axis in the $\Re^I$ and $\Re^J$ spaces.

# Polynomial biplots and elliptical confidence regions {#s.5}

When constructing a polynomial biplot, the ordered row and column
categories can be displayed in a single plot since the row and column
coordinates are computed with respect to the same set of polynomial
axes. For example, in a polynomial *row metric preserving* (or row
isometric) biplot, the column standard polynomial coordinates are
$$\begin{aligned}
\mathbf{G} = \mathbf{\mathcal{B}} \quad \left(g_{jv}=\beta_{jv} \right),
\end{aligned}$$
while the principal polynomial coordinates for the row categories are
$$\begin{aligned}
\label{eq.pcrows}
  \mathbf{F} = \mathbf{\mathcal{A}} \mathbf{Z} =\mathbf{\tilde{\Pi} W}_{J} \mathbf{\mathcal{B}} \quad \left(f_{iv} = \alpha_{iu} z_{uv} = \sum_{j=1}^{J}w_{\bullet j}\tilde{\pi}_{ij}\beta_{jv}\right).
\end{aligned}   (\#eq:eq-pcrows)$$
In practice, the coordinates for both the row and column categories are
computed using the same orthonormal polynomial axes, i.e., the column
polynomials.

The `plot` method for objects returned by `CAvariants` provides the user
with the option of constructing parametric (or algebraic) elliptical
confidence regions for all the six CA variants not only for the nominal
CA variants as originally proposed by @beh10. We compute the semi-major
and semi-minor axis lengths of the elliptical region for the row and
column categories. Here, we provide the ellipse axes lengths for the
ordered symmetric variants of correspondence analysis. For example, the
semi-major axis length of the confidence ellipse for the $i$th row
category is
$$\begin{aligned}
\label{eq:ell1}
x_{i\left(\alpha \right)}=z^2_{11} \sqrt{\frac{\chi^2_\alpha}{n \times \textrm{trace}(\mathbf{Z'Z})} \left ( \frac{1}{p_{i\bullet}}-\sum_{m=3}^{I-1}a_{im}^2 \right )},
\end{aligned}   (\#eq:ell1)$$
while the semi-minor axis length for this row is
$$\begin{aligned}
\label{eq:ell2}
y_{j\left(\alpha \right)} = z^2_{22} \sqrt{\frac{\chi^2_\alpha}{n \times \textrm{trace}(\mathbf{Z'Z})} \left ( \frac{1}{p_{i\bullet}}-\sum_{m=3}^{I-1}a_{im}^2 \right )}\,.
\end{aligned}   (\#eq:ell2)$$
Similar semi-axis lengths can also be derived for the column categories
and for the non-symmetrical CA variants. Furthermore, note that
ellipsoids can be constructed for three- or higher- dimensional
correspondence plots by considering the input parameter `M > 2` in the
`plot` method. For further details on this issue see @beh10 [@behlom14].

Unlike the confidence circles of @leb84 and the more computationally
intensive bootstrap techniques proposed in the literature
[@mark94; @lin07; @rin12; @gre84; @lomrin12], constructing confidence
ellipses in this manner takes into consideration the contribution of the
$i$th row principal polynomial coordinate in dimensions higher than the
second. In fact, since all $I$ dimensions are reflected in the
semi-major and semi-minor axis lengths, all of the contribution that a
point has to the symmetrical or asymmetrical association can be
accounted for in a two-dimensional plot using equations (\@ref(eq:ell1))
and (\@ref(eq:ell2)). Additional information for how to compute the
$p$-values of each category point can be easily found by considering a
similar theoretical development of the $p$-values described in @behlom14
[@behlom15] for a correspondence analysis of a contingency table with
nominal variables.

# An overview of the *CAvariants* package {#s.3}

The primary function discussed in this paper is `CAvariants`. It allows
the user to select which analysis to perform from a suite of six
correspondence analysis techniques. These include symmetrical (or
classical) correspondence analysis, non symmetrical correspondence
analysis and their ordered variants, described in @behlom14 [@behlom15].

The six variations of simple correspondence analysis included in the
package *CAvariants* are:

-   The classical approach to simple correspondence analysis (the
    default analysis which is defined by the input parameter
    `catype = "CA"`).

-   Two-way, or doubly ordered, symmetrical correspondence analysis (the
    user can perform this analysis by defining the input parameter
    `catype = "DOCA"`).

-   One-way, or singly ordered, correspondence analysis for tables of
    symmetrically related variables, where the column variable is
    ordered (the user can perform this analysis by defining the input
    parameter `catype = "SOCA"`).

-   Non symmetrical correspondence analysis where the nominal column
    variable is a predictor of the nominal row variable (the user can
    perform this analysis by defining the input parameter
    `catype = "NSCA"`)

-   Two-way, or doubly ordered, non symmetrical correspondence analysis
    where the ordered column variable is a predictor of the ordered row
    variable (the user can perform this analysis by defining the input
    parameter `catype = "DONSCA"`).

-   One-way, or singly ordered, non symmetrical correspondence analysis,
    where the ordered column variable is a predictor of the nominal row
    variable (the user can perform this analysis by defining the input
    parameter `catype = "SONSCA"`)

The input parameters of the function `CAvariants` are:

-   The two-way contingency table, `Xtable`.

-   The assigned ordered scores for the row categories. By default,
    `mi = NULL` which gives consecutive integer valued (natural) scores.

-   The assigned ordered scores for the column categories. By default,
    `mj = NULL` which gives consecutive integer valued (natural) scores.

-   The horizontal polynomial or principal axis. By default
    `firstaxis = 1`.

-   The vertical polynomial or principal axis. By default
    `lastaxis = 2`.

-   The input parameter for specifying what variant of correspondence
    analysis is considered. By default `catype = "CA"`, other possible
    values are:
    `catype = "SOCA", catype = "DOCA", catype = "NSCA", catype = "SONSCA", catype = "DONSCA"`.

-   The input parameter, `ellcomp`, ensures that the characteristics of
    the algebraic confidence ellipses are computed and stored. When
    `ellcomp = TRUE` (which is the default), the output includes the
    characteristics of the ellipses. The eccentricity of the confidence
    ellipses is summarized by the quantity `eccentricity`, this is the
    distance between the center and either of its two foci, which can be
    thought of as a measure of how much the conic section deviates from
    being circular (when it is equal to zero then the region becomes
    circular). The semi-major axis length of the ellipse for each row
    and column point is given by `HL Axis 1` while `HL Axis 2` gives the
    semi-minor axis length of the points along the second axis. The area
    of the ellipse for each row and column category is given by `Area`
    while the $p$-value of each category is defined by `P-value`.

-   The number of axes `Mell` considered in determining the structure of
    the elliptical confidence regions. By default,
    `Mell = min(nrow(Xtable), ncol(Xtable))`, i.e., the rank of the data
    matrix.

-   The confidence level, `alpha`, of the elliptical regions. By
    default, `alpha = 0.05`.

To visually portray and assess the statistical significance of the
categories to the association between the variables of a contingency
table, the `plot` method can be called by the user. As well as
displaying the classic correspondence plot or biplot, this function
allows one to superimpose onto the plot algebraically derived elliptical
confidence regions for each of the principal coordinates
[@leb84; @beh10; @lomrin12; @behlom15] for all CA variants. There are
other features of the plot, i.e., through the `plot` method for
"CAvariants" objects, the user may utilize. Some of these are applicable
to all of the analyses and some are applicable to only a few. The input
parameters of the `plot` method for "CAvariants" objects are:

-   The name of the output object, for example say `res`, used with the
    main function `CAvariants`.

-   The horizontal polynomial or principal axis, `firstaxis`. By
    default, `firstaxis = 1`.

-   The vertical polynomial or principal axis, `lastaxis`. By default,
    `lastaxis = 1`.

-   The size of characters, `cex`, displayed on the correspondence plot
    or biplot. By default, `cex = 0.8`.

-   The parameter, `cex.lab` that specifies the size of character labels
    of axes in graphical displays. By default, `cex.lab = 0.8`.

-   The scaling parameter, `prop`, for specifying the limits of the
    plotting area. By default, `prop = 1`.

-   The type of graphical display required (either a classical
    correspondence plot or a biplot). The user can look at a classical
    correspondence plot by defining the input parameter
    `plottype = "classic"`. When `plottype = "biplot"`, it produces
    biplot graphical displays, or polynomial biplots in case of an
    ordered analysis. Note that for an ordered analysis only polynomial
    biplots are suitable. In particular for the singly ordered variants,
    only row isometric polynomial biplots make sense, as we assume that
    the ordered variable is the column variable (the column coordinates
    are standard polynomial coordinates and the row coordinates are
    principal polynomial coordinates). By default,
    `plottype = "biplot"`.

-   For a biplot, one may specify that it be a row-isometric biplot
    (`biptype = "row"`) or a column-isometric biplot
    (`biptype = "column"`). This feature is available for the nominal
    symmetrical and the non symmetrical correspondence analyses. By
    default, a row-isometric biplot, `biptype = "row"`, is produced.

-   The parameter for scaling the biplot coordinates, `scaleplot`,
    originally proposed in Section 2.3.1 of @gow11 and described on page
    135 of @behlom14. By default, `scaleplot = 1`.

-   The parameter `posleg` for specifying the position of the legend
    when portraying trends of ordered categories in ordered variants of
    correspondence analysis. By default, `posleg = "topleft"`.

-   The parameter `pos` for specifying the position of point symbols in
    the graphical displays. By default, `pos = 2`.

-   The logical parameter, `ell` which specifies whether algebraic
    confidence ellipses are to be included in the plot or not. Setting
    the input parameter to `ell = TRUE` will allow the user to assess
    the statistical significance of each category to the association
    between the variables. The ellipses will be included when the plot
    is constructed using principal coordinates (being either row and
    column principal coordinates or row and column principal polynomial
    coordinates). By default, this input parameter is set to
    `ell = FALSE`. See also the input parameter `ellcomp` of the
    function `CAvariants` for a description of the numeric
    characteristics of the confidence ellipses (eccentricity, area,
    etc.), as well as the input parameter `ellprint` of the `print`
    method for "CAvariants" objects for getting a print of these
    parameters.

-   The number of axes `Mell` considered when portraying the elliptical
    confidence regions. By default, it is equal to
    `Mell = min(nrow(Xtable),ncol(Xtable))`, i.e., the rank of the data
    matrix. This parameter is identical to the input parameter `Mell` of
    the function `CAvariants`.

-   The confidence level of the elliptical regions. By default,
    `alpha = 0.05`.

The print method for "CAvariants" objects included in the package,
*CAvariants*, and displays the main results of the analysis specified by
the user. The results displayed depends on the type of analysis being
performed. The principal inertia values, total inertia and $p$-values
are included as part of its output when `catype = "CA"`,
`catype = "SOCA"` or `catype = "DOCA"` and are based on Pearson's
chi-squared statistic. The Goodman Kruskal tau-index is the association
measure of interest when `catype = "NSCA"`, `catype = "SONSCA"` or
`catype = "DONSCA"`. When an ordered analysis is specified -- such as
when `catype = "DOCA"`, `catype = "SOCA"`, `catype = "SONSCA"` or
`catype = "DONSCA"` -- a table describing the significant polynomial
components of inertia will also be reported.

The input parameters of the `print` method for "CAvariants" objects are:

-   The name of the output object, for example say `res`, used with the
    main function `CAvariants`.

-   The number of dimensions, `printdims`, that are used to generate the
    correspondence plot, or biplot, and for summarizing the numerical
    output of the analysis. By default, `printdims = 2`.

-   The flag parameter, `ellprint`, allows that the characteristics of
    the confidence ellipses (eccentricity, semi-axis, area, $p$-values)
    are displayed. By default, `ellprint = TRUE`.

-   The number of axes, `Mell`, used for the construction of the
    confidence ellipses. By default, it is equal to its maximum value,
    `Mell = min(nrow(Xtable), ncol(Xtable))`, i.e., the rank of the data
    matrix. This input parameter is identical to the parameter `Mell` of
    both, function `CAvariants` and the `plot` method for "CAvariants"
    objects.

-   The level of significance used for the construction of the
    elliptical regions, `alpha`. By default, `alpha = 0.05`.

-   The minimum number of decimal places, `digits`, used for displaying
    the numerical summaries of the analysis. By default, `digits = 3`.

In general, this function produces the following output:

-   The two-way contingency table, `Xtable`.

-   The matrix of row weights, `Row weights: Imass`. These weights
    depend on the type of analysis performed.

-   The matrix of column weights, `Column weights: Jmass`. These weights
    are equal to the data column margins for all types of analysis
    performed.

-   The total inertia, `Total inertia`, of the analysis performed. For
    example, when considering the variants of non symmetrical
    correspondence analysis, the numerator of the Goodman-Kruskal tau
    index, the associated C-statistic and its $p$-value are produced.

-   The inertia values, their percentage contribution to the total
    inertia and the cumulative percent inertias of the row and column
    space `Inertias`. When performing an ordered correspondence
    analysis, this output summary describes both the row and column
    spaces for each principal or polynomial axis. When `catype` is
    `"CA"` or `"NSCA"`, the associated inertia values in the row and
    column spaces are identical.

-   The generalized correlation matrix `Generalized correlation matrix`,
    when performing an ordered correspondence analysis, `catype` should
    be `"DOCA"`, `"DONSCA"`, `"SOCA"` or `"SONSCA"`.

-   The row principal coordinates, `Row principal coordinates`, when
    `catype` is `"CA"` or `"NSCA"`.

-   The column principal coordinates, `Column principal coordinates`,
    when `catype` is `"CA"` or `"NSCA"`.

-   The row standard coordinates, `Row standard coordinates `, when
    `catype` is `"CA"` or `"NSCA"`.

-   The column standard coordinates, `Column standard coordinates`, when
    `catype` is `"CA"` or `"NSCA"`.

-   The row principal polynomial coordinates,
    `Row principal polynomial coordinates`, when performing an ordered
    correspondence analysis.

-   The column principal polynomial coordinates,
    `Column principal polynomial coordinates`, when performing a doubly
    ordered correspondence analysis.

-   The `Row standard polynomial coordinates`, i.e., standard polynomial
    coordinates for the row categories when performing a doubly ordered
    correspondence analysis.

-   The `Column standard polynomial coordinates`, i.e., standard
    polynomial coordinates for the column categories when performing an
    ordered correspondence analysis.

-   The Euclidean distance of the row categories from the origin of the
    plot, `Row distances from the origin of the plot.`

-   The Euclidean distance of the column categories from the origin of
    the plot, `Column distances from the origin of the plot.`

-   The polynomial components of the total inertia and their $p$-values,
    `Polynomial components`. The total inertia of the column space is
    partitioned to identify polynomial components when `catype` is
    `"SOCA"` or `"SONSCA"`. When `catype` is `"DOCA"` or `"DONSCA"`, the
    total inertia of both the row and column space is partitioned to
    identify of polynomial components.

-   The inner product, `Inner product`, of the biplot coordinates
    (concerning the first two axes when `firstaxis = 1` and
    `lastaxis = 2`).

-   When the input flag parameter is `ellprint = TRUE`, then the print
    includes the eccentricity of the confidence ellipses, the semi-major
    axis length of the ellipse for each row and column point,
    `HL Axis 1`, the semi-minor axis length for the ellipse for each row
    and column point, `HL Axis 2`, the area of the ellipse for each row
    and column point, `Area` and the $p$-value for each row and column
    point, `P-value`, see also the parameter `ellcomp` of the function
    `CAvariants` for a detailed description of these parameters.

Furthermore, package *CAvariants* contains a `summary` method for the
objects returned by `CAvariants`. This method provides the list of the
objects names of the output and a selection of the main output objects
described in the `print` method for objects returned by `CAvariants`.

## Numerical outputs

As an example of the complete set of numerical results that is obtained
from performing a particular variant of correspondence analysis,
consider the case where a singly ordered non symmetrical correspondence
analysis is performed on the data table `shopdataM` available in the
package *CAvariants*. This object is the contingency table being
analyzed and is described more fully in SectionÂ [6](#s.6). The output
object name of the main function is called `res` and is the execution of
the `CAvariants` function on the `shopdataM`. The object `res` is
obtained using

``` r
R> res <- CAvariants(shopdataM, catype = "SONSCA")
```

The results are available in the following entries which can be obtained
using

``` r
R> names(res)
```

which gives

``` r
 [1] "Xtable"      "rows"        "cols"        "r"           "rowlabels"  
 [6] "collabels"   "Rprinccoord" "Cprinccoord" "Rstdcoord"   "Cstdcoord"  
[11] "tauden"      "tau"         "inertiasum"  "inertias"    "inertias2"  
[16] "comps"       "catype"      "mj"          "mi"          "pcc"        
[21] "Jmass"       "Imass"       "Trend"       "Z"           "ellcomp"    
[26] "risell"      "Mell"       
```

These results may be printed to the screen by using

``` r
R> print(res)
```

while a summary of each of these numerical features is produced by using

``` r
R> summary(res)
```

# Application {#s.6}

To demonstrate the application of a variant of simple correspondence
analysis described in the *CAvariants* package, we present the following
example. We shall confine our attention to the non symmetrical
correspondence analysis of a singly ordered contingency table. The
contingency table that we are examining is concerned with shoplifting in
The Netherlands and summarizes, in part, the results of a survey of the
Dutch Central Bureau of Statistics [@isr87]. The data considers a sample
of 20819 men who were suspected of shoplifting in Dutch stores between
1977 and 1978. The predictor variable consists of the age groups of the
perpetrators (less than 12yrs, 12 to 14yrs, 15 to 17yrs, 18 to 20yrs, 21
to 29yrs, 30 to 39yrs, 40 to 49yrs, 50 to 64yrs, 65yrs and over) while
the response variable of the table consists of the items stolen. These
items are *clothing*, *clothing accessory*, *tobacco and/or provisions*,
*stationary*, *books*, *records*, *household goods*, *candy*, *toys*,
*jewelry*, *perfume*, *hobby and/or tools* and *other items*. For an
extensive description of this example, and the application of
correspondence analysis, see @lom16.

After choosing the suitable variant of correspondence analysis, we
create the object `res` that consists of the complete features of the
analysis by running the command

``` r
R> res <- CAvariants(shopdataM, catype = "SONSCA")
```

`print(res)` will return as part of its output the following numerical
features:

The total inertia of data, defined by the Goodman-Kruskal tau index
(which may also be referred to as the index of predictability) when
performing a non symmetrical correspondence analysis, is
$\tau = 0.0414$; in the output this is reflected by
`Tau Index predicting the rows given the column`. To determine whether
this index is statistically significant, we compute the $C$-statistic
and find that it is equal to 10331.5 (with 96 degrees of freedom).
Therefore, with a $p$-value that is less than $0.0001$, the age of the
perpetrators is a strong predictor of the items that are stolen. The
Goodman-Kruskal tau index and the statistical significance of the
$C$-statistic are summarized as part of the output, together with the
partition of the $C$-statistic, which identifies significant sources of
variation in the ordered column categories. Indeed, we can look at the
inertia explained by each polynomial axis to mark differences with the
other non-ordered analysis. We can see that the most dominant
contribution to the total inertia of the data is due to the component
associated with the linear polynomial of the columns. This location
component is $6182$ and explains 59.8% of the total inertia. The next
most dominant is the dispersion component of 2642 and reflects that
25.6% of the variation in the column categories is due to their
difference in dispersion. Similarly, the cubic component is 757 and
accounts for about 7% of the column variation. Even if the remaining,
higher order, components are all statistically significant (their
associated $p$-value is less than 0.001), they will be not taken into
consideration since polynomials with degree higher than three (and more
commonly, four) show limited information about the association structure
and variation of the variables. Hence, collectively, components higher
than the fourth are referred to as the *error* polynomial component.
Note that the first two components (linear and dispersion) explain 85.4%
of the total inertia, so the first two polynomial axes will provide a
sufficient graphical display of the variation of the categories.
Furthermore, with the specification of `ellprint = TRUE` in the `print`
method for "CAvariants" objects, the output consists of the eccentricity
value of the ellipses, the semi-axis lengths of the ellipse for each of
the categories, the area of each ellipse and the associated $p$-values.

### Polynomial biplot: Portraying the predictability

When an ordered analysis is performed, the trend plots of the row and
column categories are depicted. For example, when performing a singly
ordered NSCA, the variation, or trend, of the row categories is examined
by observing how it is affected by the ordered column categories when
using a polynomial transformation. Figure [1](#fig.shop-trend-sonsca)
shows a parabolic trend of the row category *clothing*. This trend
highlights that there is a greater propensity to steal clothing by
people aged 25 to 45 years than those of a younger, or older, age.
Figure [2](#fig.sonsca-shop) provides an alternative visual display of
these trends and is constructed by depicting the row (items) categories
using principal coordinates and the column (age) categories using
standard coordinates. Hence a row isometric biplot is constructed. Since
the analysis also incorporates the ordered nature of the column
categories and the nominal structure of the row categories, Figure
[2](#fig.sonsca-shop) is referred to as the row isometric polynomial
biplot of the data.

![Figure 1: Trend of rows: A selection of rows of the centered column
profile table reconstructed by using the first two
polynomials.](shopM-trend-sonsca.png){#fig.shop-trend-sonsca
width="100%" alt="graphic without alt text"}

The trend plot of FigureÂ [1](#fig.shop-trend-sonsca) and the polynomial
biplot given by FigureÂ [2](#fig.sonsca-shop) can be obtained using the
following command:

``` r
R> plot(res,  plottype = "biplot", biptype = "row", scaleplot = 5, pos = 1)
```

When the first two polynomial axes are used to construct the biplot of
Figure [2](#fig.sonsca-shop), the resulting configuration has a
parabolic shape. Observe that the explained inertia of the polynomial
axes is as follows: The first polynomial axis accounts for 59.8% of the
inertia and the second polynomial axis for 25.6% of the inertia. We can
therefore see that the novelty of the polynomial biplot is based on the
polynomial representation of the predictor variable. The first linear
polynomial axis represents the deviation from the mean centered profile
accounting for the ordered structure of the age groups, which is
reflected in the correct ordering of the age categories along the first
polynomial axis. The second polynomial axis shows a parabolic shape of
the categories with positive concavity. Furthermore, note that the
left-hand side of the first axis is dominated by the young age groups
with adolescents and young adults at the center of the display (who
steal items consistent with the average number of thefts of all items).
The mid-adult and older age groups are on the right-hand side of
FigureÂ [2](#fig.sonsca-shop).

![Figure 2: Row-isometric polynomial biplot of singly ordered NSCA of
shoplifting data: first two polynomial components, *Stolen goods* and
*Age*. ](shopMoriginal-plot12-rowsbiplot-unique2.png){#fig.sonsca-shop
width="100%" alt="graphic without alt text"}

The magnitude of the coordinates indicate the importance of the first
two polynomial components for modeling the trends of the items. In
particular, we see that the first two polynomial coordinates are
sufficient to model the trends for most stolen goods.

![Figure 3: 95% confidence ellipses in the row isometric polynomial
biplot of singly ordered NSCA of the shoplifting data: *Stolen goods*
and
*Age*.](shopMoriginal-plot12-rowsbiplot-ellipseBEH3.png){#fig.sonsca-shop-ellipse
width="100%" alt="graphic without alt text"}

The reliability of the graphical representation can be assessed by
constructing elliptical confidence regions for the row categories which
are depicted using row principal polynomial coordinates. These ellipses
can be obtained using the `plot` method for "CAvariants" objects such
that

``` r
R> plot(res, scaleplot = 1, ell = TRUE, alpha = 0.05)
```

Figure [3](#fig.sonsca-shop-ellipse) gives the 95% confidence ellipses
for the row categories and are constructed so that the weights of the
semi-axes are expressed in terms of the hybrid generalized correlations
rather than the squared singular values associated to each axis. These
ellipses are constructed so that the information contained in all of the
dimensions is depicted so that, for the `plot` method for "CAvariants"
objects, `M = 8`. Since this figure does not show clearly ellipses for a
scale problem of coordinates, we can focus our attention more closely to
those points closer to the origin of
FigureÂ [3](#fig.sonsca-shop-ellipse) by specifying that

``` r
R> plot(res, scaleplot = 1, ell = TRUE, alpha = 0.05, prop = 60)
```

By zooming closer to the origin, the configuration of points near the
origin is given by Figure [4](#fig.sonsca-shop.zoom). It shows the
overlap of the confidence region for perfumes with the origin. It means
that all of the items, except *perfumes*, are important contributors to
the asymmetric association since their confidence ellipses do not
overlap with the origin of the plot.

![Figure 4: A zoomed view of the origin of the row-isometric polynomial
biplot given by Figure
[3](#fig.sonsca-shop-ellipse).](shopM-focus-ellipse-rowbiplot.png){#fig.sonsca-shop.zoom
width="100%" alt="graphic without alt text"}

The contribution of all items to the association structure is also
reflected in the $p$-values that are summarized as part of the output of
the `print` method for "CAvariants" objects with `M = 8` and appear in
the last column of the table, titled
`Ellipse axes, Area, `$p$`-values of rows` where `alpha = 0.05`. These
results show that the only non-statistically significant row category is
*perfumes*, as expected from its ellipse, with a $p$-value of 0.297. If
we now consider the age of the males in the sample, and specify `M = 8`
when constructing confidence ellipses and calculating $p$-values, see
the last column of the table titled
`Ellipse axes, Area, p-values of columns`, all age groups are useful
predictors of the items that are stolen.

# Conclusion {#s.7}

There are many freely downloadable programs/code available for
performing classical correspondence analysis. For example, the R code of
@nen07 and @del09a may be considered for performing simple and joint
correspondence analysis. However, the *CAvariants* package provides
variants of correspondence analysis which are not offered by other
correspondence analysis R packages on CRAN. To the best of these
authors' knowledge, *CAvariants* is the only package available that
provides the user with the option of performing six variants of two-way
correspondence analysis and, in particular, ordered symmetrical and non
symmetrical correspondence analysis variants. Indeed, symmetrical
correspondence analysis for ordered variables was implemented in SPLUS
by @beh04b and has been easily adapted for R.

Subsequent versions of the function may allow for more flexibility by
giving the user more tools to assess the reliability of graphical
results. These may include bootstrap confidence regions to complement
the algebraic regions developed by these authors, or three-dimensional
polynomial biplots. While @behlom14 and @lom16 describe the theoretical
aspects of these variants of correspondence analysis for two-way
contingency tables in detail, they also provide fragments of R code to
undertake the relevant calculations. However, this paper has described
the CAvariants package by demonstrating the applicability of one variant
and providing new insight into the development of elliptical regions for
ordered variants of correspondence analysis.
