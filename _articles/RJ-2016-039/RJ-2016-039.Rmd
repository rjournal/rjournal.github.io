title: Variants of Simple Correspondence Analysis
abstract: This paper presents the R package CAvariants (Lombardo and Beh, 2017). The
  package performs six variants of correspondence analysis on a two-way contingency
  table. The main function that shares the same name as the package – CAvariants –
  allows the user to choose (via a series of input parameters) from six different
  correspondence analysis procedures. These include the classical approach to (symmetrical)
  correspondence analysis, singly ordered correspondence analysis, doubly ordered
  correspondence analysis, non symmetrical correspondence analysis, singly ordered
  non symmetrical correspondence analysis and doubly ordered non symmetrical correspondence
  analysis. The code provides the flexibility for constructing either a classical
  correspondence plot or a biplot graphical display. It also allows the user to consider
  other important features that allow to assess the reliability of the graphical representations,
  such as the inclusion of algebraically derived elliptical confidence regions. This
  paper provides R functions that elaborates more fully on the code presented in Beh
  and Lombardo (2014).
