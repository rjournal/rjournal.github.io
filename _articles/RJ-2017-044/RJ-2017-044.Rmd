title: 'fourierin: An R package to compute Fourier integrals'
abstract: We present the R package fourierin (Basulto-Elias, 2017) for evaluating
  functions defined as Fourier-type integrals over a collection of argument values.
  The integrals are finitely supported with integrands involving continuous functions
  of one or two variables. As an important application, such Fourier integrals arise
  in so-called “inversion formulas”, where one seeks to evaluate a probability density
  at a series of points from a given characteristic function (or vice versa) through
  Fourier transforms. This paper intends to fill a gap in current R software, where
  tools for repeated evaluation of functions as Fourier integrals are not directly
  available. We implement two approaches for such computations with numerical integration.
  In particular, if the argument collection for evaluation corresponds to a regular
  grid, then an algorithm from Inverarity (2002) may be employed based on a fast Fourier
  transform, which creates significant improvements in the speed over a second approach
  to numerical Fourier integration (where the latter also applies to cases where the
  points for evaluation are not on a grid). We illustrate the package with the computation
  of probability densities and characteristic functions through Fourier integrals/transforms,
  for both univariate and bivariate examples.
