title: 'imputeTS: Time Series Missing Value Imputation in R'
abstract: The imputeTS package specializes on univariate time series imputation. It
  offers multiple state-of-the-art imputation algorithm implementations along with
  plotting functions for time series missing data statistics. While imputation in
  general is a well-known problem and widely covered by R packages, finding packages
  able to fill missing values in univariate time series is more complicated. The reason
  for this lies in the fact, that most imputation algorithms rely on inter-attribute
  correlations, while univariate time series imputation instead needs to employ time
  dependencies. This paper provides an introduction to the imputeTS package and its
  provided algorithms and tools. Furthermore, it gives a short overview about univariate
  time series imputation in R.
