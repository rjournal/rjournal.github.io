title: 'ConvergenceClubs: A Package for Performing the Phillips and Sul''s Club Convergence
  Clustering Procedure'
abstract: This paper introduces package ConvergenceClubs, which implements functions
  to perform the Phillips and Sul (2007, 2009) club convergence clustering procedure
  in a simple and reproducible manner. The approach proposed by Phillips and Sul to
  analyse the convergence patterns of groups of economies is formulated as a nonlinear
  time varying factor model that allows for different time paths as well as individual
  heterogeneity. Unlike other approaches in which economies are grouped a priori,
  it also allows the endogenous determination of convergence clubs. The algorithm,
  usage, and implementation details are discussed.
