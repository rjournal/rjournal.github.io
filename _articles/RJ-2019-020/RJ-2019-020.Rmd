title: 'Nowcasting: An R Package for Predicting Economic Variables Using Dynamic Factor
  Models'
abstract: The nowcasting package provides the tools to make forecasts of monthly or
  quarterly economic variables using dynamic factor models. The objective is to help
  the user at each step of the forecasting process, starting with the construction
  of a database, all the way to the interpretation of the forecasts. The dynamic factor
  model adopted in this package is based on the articles from Giannone et al. (2008)
  and Banbura et al. (2011). Although there exist several other dynamic factor model
  packages available for R, ours provides an environment to easily forecast economic
  variables and interpret results.
