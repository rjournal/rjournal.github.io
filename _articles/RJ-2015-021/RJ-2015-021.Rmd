title: 'QuantifQuantile: An R Package for Performing Quantile Regression Through Optimal
  Quantization'
abstract: In quantile regression, various quantiles of a response variable Y are modelled
  as func tions of covariates (rather than its mean). An important application is
  the construction of reference curves/surfaces and conditional prediction intervals
  for Y. Recently, a nonparametric quantile regres sion method based on the concept
  of optimal quantization was proposed. This method competes very well with k-nearest
  neighbor, kernel, and spline methods. In this paper, we describe an R package, called
  QuantifQuantile, that allows to perform quantization-based quantile regression.
  We describe the various functions of the package and provide examples.
