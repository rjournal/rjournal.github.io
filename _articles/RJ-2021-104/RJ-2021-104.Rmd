title: Generalized Linear Randomized Response Modeling using GLMMRR
abstract: Randomized response (RR) designs are used to collect response data about
  sensitive behaviors (e.g., criminal behavior, sexual desires). The modeling of RR
  data is more complex since it requires a description of the RR process. For the
  class of generalized linear mixed models (GLMMs), the RR process can be represented
  by an adjusted link function, which relates the expected RR to the linear predictor
  for most common RR designs. The package GLMMRR includes modified link functions
  for four different cumulative distributions (i.e., logistic, cumulative normal,
  Gumbel, Cauchy) for GLMs and GLMMs, where the package lme4 facilitates ML and REML
  estimation. The mixed modeling framework in GLMMRR can be used to jointly analyze
  data collected under different designs (e.g., dual questioning, multilevel, mixed
  mode, repeated measurements designs, multiple-group designs). Model-fit tests, tools
  for residual analyses, and plot functions to give support to a profound RR data
  analysis are added to the well-known features of the GLM and GLMM software (package
  lme4). Data of Höglinger and Jann (2018) and Höglinger, Jann, and Diekmann (2014)
  are used to illustrate the methodology and software.
