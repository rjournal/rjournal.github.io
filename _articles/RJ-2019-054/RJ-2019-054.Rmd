title: The R Package trafo for Transforming Linear Regression Models
abstract: Researchers and data-analysts often use the linear regression model for
  descriptive, predictive, and inferential purposes. This model relies on a set of
  assumptions that, when not satisfied, yields biased results and noisy estimates.
  A common problem that can be solved in many ways â€“ use of less restrictive methods
  (e.g. generalized linear regression models or non-parametric methods ), variance
  corrections or transformations of the response variable just to name a few. We focus
  on the latter option as it allows to keep using the simple and well-known linear
  regression model. The list of transformations proposed in the literature is long
  and varies according to the problem they aim to solve. Such diversity can leave
  analysts lost and confused. We provide a framework implemented as an R-package,
  trafo, to help select suitable transformations depending on the user requirements
  and data being analyzed. The package trafo contains a collection of selected transformations
  and estimation methods that complement and increase the breadth of methods that
  exist in R.
