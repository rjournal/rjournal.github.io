title: 'MRCV: A Package for Analyzing Categorical Variables with Multiple Response
  Options'
abstract: Multiple response categorical variables (MRCVs), also known as "pick any"
  or "choose all that apply" variables, summarize survey questions for which respondents
  are allowed to select more than one category response option. Traditional methods
  for analyzing the association between categorical variables are not appropriate
  with MRCVs due to the within-subject dependence among responses. We have developed
  the ***MRCV*** package as the first R package available to correctly analyze MRCV
  data. Statistical methods offered by our package include counterparts to traditional
  Pearson chi-square tests for independence and loglinear models, where bootstrap
  methods and Rao-Scott adjustments are relied on to obtain valid inferences. We demonstrate
  the primary functions within the package by analyzing data from a survey assessing
  the swine waste management practices of Kansas farmers.

# Introduction

Survey questions often instruct respondents to "choose all that apply"
from a list of response categories. For example, surveys instituted by
U.S. government agencies are mandated to ask race and ethnicity
questions in this format ([@OMB:1997], p. 58781). In medical
applications, "choose all that apply" questions have been used for a
variety of purposes, including gathering information about treatment and
monitoring strategies [@{Kantarjian+:2007}; @{Riegel+:2006}]. Outside of
surveys, this format can appear in unexpected applications. For example,
wildlife management researchers are often interested in the food habits
of animal species. Traces of prey in scats provide these researchers
with a "choose all that apply" type of response because multiple prey
types may be present ([@{Lemons+:2010}; @Riemer+Wright+Brown:2011]).

Variables that summarize data arising from a "choose all that apply"
format are referred to as multiple response categorical variables
(MRCVs), and the response categories within each MRCV are referred to as
items [@Bilder+Loughin:2004]. Because individual subjects are allowed to
choose multiple items, the responses are likely dependent, and therefore
traditional methods for analyzing categorical variables (e.g., Pearson
chi-square tests for independence, loglinear models) are not
appropriate. Unfortunately, numerous examples exist where these
traditional methods are still used (see [@Wright:2010] for a review),
which can lead to erroneous results [@Loughin+Scherer:1998].

While MRCVs have been identified since at least @Coombs:1964, methods
for correctly analyzing MRCVs in the context of common categorical data
analysis interests, such as examining associations between variables,
have only been available for approximately 15 years (e.g., see
[@Agresti+Liu:1999]). Our
[***MRCV***](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=MRCV) package
[@Koziol+Bilder:2014] is the first R package available to implement
valid inference procedures for this type of data. The functions within
the package can be used by researchers who want to examine the
relationship among items from up to three MRCVs.

We begin this paper by first illustrating functions within the package
for summarizing MRCV data and testing for independence. Then, we
illustrate functions for fitting a generalized loglinear model to MRCV
data and for performing follow-up analyses using method functions. Our
examples focus on only two MRCVs for brevity reasons, but we discuss
extensions in the conclusion.

# Test for independence

We begin with an example from @Bilder+Loughin:2007 involving a simple
random sample of Kansas swine farmers. There are two MRCVs to be
examined here, and we denote them generically as $W$ and $Y$. The first
MRCV ($W$) corresponds to a survey question that asked farmers to state
which contaminants they tested for from the items "nitrogen",
"phosphorous", and "salt" ($W_{1}$, $W_{2}$, $W_{3}$, respectively). The
second MRCV ($Y$) corresponds to a survey question that asked farmers to
identify their swine waste storage methods from the items "lagoon",
"pit", "natural drainage", and "holding tank" ($Y_{1}$, $Y_{2}$,
$Y_{3}$, $Y_{4}$, respectively). Farmers were instructed to "choose all
that apply" from each of these predefined lists. By using a $0$ to
denote an item not chosen (negative response) and a $1$ to denote an
item chosen (positive response), each observation consists of a set of
correlated binary responses, as shown below:

``` r
  > head(farmer2, n = 3)
    w1 w2 w3 y1 y2 y3 y4
  1  0  0  0  0  0  0  0
  2  0  0  0  0  0  0  1
  3  0  0  0  0  0  0  1
  
  > tail(farmer2, n = 3)
      w1 w2 w3 y1 y2 y3 y4
  277  1  1  1  1  1  0  0
  278  1  1  1  1  1  0  0
  279  1  1  1  1  1  1  0
```

We see, for example, that the third farmer does not test for any
contaminants and uses only a holding tank for waste storage.

Contingency table-like summaries of MRCV data are often given in papers.
In particular, marginal counts for all pairwise positive responses
between items in $W$ and $Y$ are shown in Table [1](#table:1). This
display format can lead researchers to want to apply Pearson chi-square
tests (or other simple categorical measures) to the table of counts in
order to understand associations between the MRCVs. However, this
approach is not correct because it does not take into account the fact
that an individual subject can contribute to multiple counts in the
table, which violates any type of multinomial distribution underlying
assumption for these specific counts. Furthermore, three other tables
summarizing the pairwise positive/negative responses (e.g., summarizing
responses for items "not" chosen) of this type could also be
constructed. @Agresti+Liu:1999 and @Bilder+Loughin:2001 show that
testing procedures are not invariant to whether positive or negative
responses are summarized and that different conclusions about the data
can be reached depending on the types of responses summarized.

  While not recommended, this summary format is available through the
  `marginal.table()` function of ***MRCV***.
:::

Examining all possible combinations of the positive/negative item
responses between MRCVs is the preferred way to display and subsequently
analyze MRCV data. The `item.response.table()` function provides this
summary for each ($W_{i}$, $Y_{j}$) pair:

``` r
  > item.response.table(data = farmer2, I = 3, J = 4)
                                            
         y1        y2       y3       y4      
         0   1     0   1    0   1    0   1   
   w1 0  123 116  175 64   156 83   228 11  
      1   13  27   24 16    38  2    38  2  
   w2 0  128 121  181 68   165 84   237 12  
      1    8  22   18 12    29  1    29  1  
   w3 0  134 124  184 74   174 84   245 13  
      1    2  19   15  6    20  1    21  0 
```

where `I` is the number of items for $W$ and `J` is the number of items
for $Y$. The pairwise item-response table indicates, for example, that
$27$ farmers tested for nitrogen and used lagoon as a waste storage
method (i.e., $W_{1}=1$, $Y_{1}=1$). Furthermore, $123$ farmers did not
test for nitrogen and did not use a lagoon, $13$ farmers tested for
nitrogen without using a lagoon, and $116$ farmers did not test for
nitrogen while using a lagoon. In total, $27+123+13+116=279$ farmers
participated in the survey (there are no missing responses to any item).

@Agresti+Liu:1999 provided the MRCV extension to testing for
independence between single response categorical variables (SRCVs). This
test, known as a test for simultaneous pairwise marginal independence
(SPMI), involves determining whether each $W_{1}$, ..., $W_{I}$ is
pairwise independent of each $Y_{1}$, ..., $Y_{J}$. Our `MI.test()`
function calculates their modified Pearson statistic as
$X_{S}^{2}=\sum\nolimits_{i=1}^{I}\sum\nolimits_{j=1}^{J}X_{S,i,j}^{2}$
where $X_{S,i,j}^{2}$ is the usual Pearson chi-square statistic used in
this situation to test for independence in the
2$\times$`<!-- -->`{=html}2 tables formed by each ($W_{i}$, $Y_{j}$)
response combination. In our example, $X_{S}^{2}$ is the sum of 12
pairwise marginal tests for independence. In general, $X_{S}^{2}$ does
not have an asymptotic $\chi_{IJ}^{2}$ distribution due to dependency
among the $X_{S,i,j}^{2}$. Rather, the asymptotic distribution is a
linear combination of independent $\chi_{1}^{2}$ random variables
[@Bilder+Loughin:2004].

The `MI.test()` function offers three methods, available through its
`type` argument, that can be used with $X_{S}^{2}$ or the
$X_{S,i,j}^{2}$ individual statistics to perform valid tests for SPMI.
The `type = "boot"` argument value specifies the use of the
nonparametric bootstrap to estimate the sampling distribution of
$X_{S}^{2}$ under SPMI and to calculate an appropriate p-value using `B`
resamples. In addition, two p-value combination methods---the product
and minimum of p-values---are implemented to combine the p-values
obtained from $X_{S,i,j}^{2}$ and a $\chi_{1}^{2}$ approximation.
Details on these bootstrap approaches are given in @Bilder+Loughin:2004.
The `type = "rs2"` argument value applies a Rao-Scott second-order
adjustment to $X_{S}^{2}$ and its sampling distribution. This procedure
adjusts $X_{S}^{2}$ to match the first two moments of a chi-square
random variable, asymptotically. Details on this approach are provided
in @Bilder+Loughin:2004 and @Thomas+Decady:2004. Finally, the
`type = "bon"` argument value simply applies a Bonferroni adjustment
with each $X_{S,i,j}^{2}$ and a $\chi_{1}^{2}$ approximation. To
implement all three methods, we can use the `type = "all"` argument
value:

``` r
  > set.seed(102211) # Set seed to replicate bootstrap results
  > MI.test(data = farmer2, I = 3, J = 4, type = "all", B = 1999, plot.hist = TRUE)

  Unadjusted Pearson Chi-Square Tests for Independence: 
  X^2_S = 64.03 
  X^2_S.ij =

  Final results based on 1999 resamples 
  p.boot = 0.0005 
  p.combo.prod = 0.0005 
  p.combo.min = 0.001 
   
  Second-Order Rao-Scott Adjusted Results: 
  X^2_S.adj = 36.17 
  df.adj = 6.78 
  p.adj < 0.0001 
   
  Bonferroni Adjusted Results: 
  p.adj = 0.0019 
  p.ij.adj = 
     y1     y2     y3     y4

  w3 0.0022 1.0000 0.0934 1.0000
```

Figure [1](#figure:1) shows histograms from the bootstrap
implementations. All of the methods provide strong evidence for
rejecting SPMI. The $X_{S,i,j}^{2}$ and corresponding Bonferroni
adjusted p-values indicate a significant association for the ($W_{1}$,
$Y_{3}$), ($W_{2}$, $Y_{3}$), and ($W_{3}$, $Y_{1}$) combinations.

# Loglinear modeling

SPMI is only one possible association structure between MRCVs.
@Bilder+Loughin:2007 introduced a flexible loglinear modeling approach
that allows researchers to consider alternative association structures
somewhere between SPMI and complete dependence. Within this framework, a
model under SPMI is given as

$$\log\left(\mu_{ab(ij)}\right)=\gamma_{ij}+\eta_{a(ij)}^{W}+\eta_{b(ij)}^{Y}  
\label{eq:1}   (\#eq:1)$$

where $\mu_{ab(ij)}$ is the expected number of subjects who responded
($W_{i}=a$, $Y_{j}=b$) for $a$, $b$ $\in \{0,1\}$. The terms on the
right side of the model are the same as for a loglinear model under
independence between two SRCVs, where we have added a subscript ($ij$)
to indicate a particular 2$\times$`<!-- -->`{=html}2 table for ($W_{i}$,
$Y_{j}$) within the pairwise item-response table. The usual constraints
are placed on the model parameters to maintain identifiability.

Adding additional terms to Equation \@ref(eq:1) leads to different types
of association structures between the MRCVs. For example, adding
$\lambda_{ab}$ to Equation \@ref(eq:1) produces a homogeneous
association model (i.e., a model that implies equal odds ratios, not
necessarily equal to $1$, for each 2$\times$`<!-- -->`{=html}2 table),
adding $\lambda_{ab(i)}^{W}$ or $\lambda_{ab(j)}^{Y}$ to the homogeneous
association model produces a W- or Y-main effects model, respectively,
and adding both of these terms to the homogeneous association model
produces a W- and Y-main effects model. The addition of a WY interaction
term, $\lambda_{ab(ij)}^{WY}$, produces the saturated model.

The `genloglin()` function estimates the above models through a marginal
estimation approach. Within `genloglin()`, a new data frame is created
by converting the raw data into the pairwise item-response counts:

``` r
  > item.response.table(data = farmer2, I = 3, J = 4, create.dataframe = TRUE)
      W  Y wi yj count
  1  w1 y1  0  0   123
  2  w1 y1  0  1   116
  3  w1 y1  1  0    13
  4  w1 y1  1  1    27
  5  w1 y2  0  0   175
  
  < output omitted > 
  
  48 w3 y4  1  1     0
```

The `glm()` function is subsequently called from within `genloglin()` to
estimate a loglinear model to these counts. Rao-Scott adjustments are
then applied to obtain valid large-sample standard error estimates. The
`model` argument of `genloglin()` can take the names of `"spmi"`,
`"homogeneous"`, `"w.main"`, `"y.main"`, `"wy.main"`, and `"saturated"`
to specify a particular model. Alternatively, a user-supplied formula
allows for more flexibility by specifying the model in terms of `W`,
`Y`, `wi`, `yj`, `count`, `W1`, ..., `WI`, and `Y1`, ..., `YJ`, which we
illustrate shortly. The `boot = TRUE` (the default) value for
`genloglin()` specifies that resamples should be taken under the fitted
model. We use the method of @Gange:1995 for generating correlated binary
data to perform semi-parametric bootstrap resampling in this case. These
resamples are subsequently used for hypothesis tests, confidence
intervals, and/or standardized residuals with our related method
functions for objects returned by `genloglin()`.

We demonstrate the `genloglin()` function by estimating the Y-main
effects model to the `farmer2` data, and then summarize the results
using our `summary()` method function:

``` r
  > set.seed(499077) # Set seed to replicate bootstrap results
  > mod.fit <- genloglin(data = farmer2, I = 3, J = 4, model = "y.main", B = 1999, 
  +                      print.status = FALSE)
  > summary(mod.fit)
  
  Call:
  glm(formula = count ~ -1 + W:Y + wi %in% W:Y + yj %in% W:Y + wi:yj + wi:yj %in% Y, 
    family = poisson(link = log), data = model.data)
  
  Deviance Residuals: 
       Min        1Q    Median        3Q       Max  
  -1.58007  -0.13272   0.00043   0.10282   0.79587  
  
  Coefficients:
             Estimate    RS SE z value Pr(>|z|)    
  Ww1:Yy1     4.83360  0.06535  73.969  < 2e-16 ***
  Ww2:Yy1     4.85571  0.06387  76.023  < 2e-16 ***
  Ww3:Yy1     4.87418  0.06314  77.199  < 2e-16 ***
  
  < output omitted >   
  
          Null deviance: 25401.0663    Residual deviance:     5.8825
          Number of Fisher Scoring iterations: 4
```

The `print.status` argument can be changed to `TRUE` (default) in order
to print model fitting information while the function is running.
Information typically provided by the `glm()` function can be extracted
from `mod.fit`.

The `formula` argument within the `Call:` portion of the output displays
an alternative way that the Y-main effects model could have been
specified using variable names. For a model under SPMI (Equation
\@ref(eq:1)), the syntax `-1 + W:Y + wi %in% W:Y + yj %in% W:Y`
specifies an ordinary loglinear model under independence *within* each
2$\times$`<!-- -->`{=html}2 table formed by the ($W_{i}$, $Y_{j}$)
pairs; i.e., the intercept (`W:Y`), "row effect" (`wi %in% W:Y`), and
"column effect" (`yj %in% W:Y`) terms. Note that the addition of
`wi:yj %in% W:Y` would then lead to a saturated loglinear model within
the 2$\times$`<!-- -->`{=html}2 tables. Instead, the addition of
`wi:yj + wi:yj %in% Y` allows for the associations to vary across the
items in $Y$ (waste storage) but to be the same across items in $W$
(contaminant).

The deviance values in the output should not be used with chi-square
distributional approximations to construct traditional model comparison
tests. Instead, our `anova()` method function offers bootstrap and
Rao-Scott second-order adjustments (`type = "boot"` and `type = "rs2"`,
respectively, or `type = "all"` for both methods) to obtain appropriate
tests for comparing the model specified in `genloglin()` to an
alternative model given by its `model.HA` argument. Comparing the Y-main
effects model to the saturated model shows moderate evidence of
lack-of-fit:

``` r
  > anova(object = mod.fit, model.HA = "saturated", type = "all")
  
  Model comparison statistics for 
  H0 = y.main 
  HA = saturated 
   
  Pearson chi-square statistic = 5.34 
  LRT statistic = 5.88 
  
  Second-Order Rao-Scott Adjusted Results: 
  Rao-Scott Pearson chi-square statistic = 10.85, df = 5.23, p = 0.0624 
  Rao-Scott LRT statistic = 11.96, df = 5.23, p = 0.0409 
  
  Bootstrap Results: 
  Final results based on 1999 resamples 
  Pearson chi-square p-value = 0.0385 
  LRT p-value = 0.0255
```

Our `residuals()` method function provides Pearson standardized
residuals, where bootstrap or asymptotic standard errors can be used in
their formation. For the Y-main effects model, we find that lack-of-fit
occurs for the ($W_{3}$, $Y_{1}$) association. This suggests the need to
estimate a new model that explicitly accounts for the heterogeneity:

``` r
mod.fit.w3y1 <- genloglin(data = farmer2, I = 3, J = 4, model = count ~ -1 + W:Y +
                          wi %in% W:Y + yj %in% W:Y + wi:yj + wi:yj %in% Y + 
                          wi:yj %in% W3:Y1, B = 1999)
```

where the `wi:yj %in% W3:Y1` term forces a perfect fit to the ($W_{3}$,
$Y_{1}$) association while still maintaining a Y-main effects model
elsewhere.

Once an appropriate model has been identified, our `predict()` method
function can be used to obtain observed and model-estimated odds ratios
with corresponding asymptotic and bootstrap BC$_{\text{a}}$
[@Efron:1987] confidence intervals. These odds ratios help to facilitate
interpretation of the association among items between the two MRCVs.

# Summary

The equivalents of many traditional categorical data analysis methods
are implemented within our package in the context of MRCVs. We
demonstrated a few of the package's primary functions for analyzing the
association between two MRCVs. While not shown here, these functions can
be used to analyze MRCVs in other settings. For instance, tests for
*multiple marginal independence* (MMI; [@Agresti+Liu:1999]) between an
MRCV and an SRCV can be performed by `MI.test()`, where the `I` argument
is set to a value of $1$. An example is given within the help file for
this function. Additionally, the MRCV package can be used to analyze the
association between three MRCVs. For example, @Bilder+Loughin:2007
discuss a third "choose all that apply" question asked of the swine
farmers that relates to the farmers' sources of veterinary information.
We show in the help file for `genloglin()` how to estimate a generalized
loglinear model for this setting.

@Agresti+Liu:1999 [@Agresti+Liu:2001] show how to take advantage of many
commonly used modeling methods (e.g., generalized linear mixed models)
for MRCV data. Most of these methods have disadvantages to their
use---for example, standard generalized linear mixed models induce a
positive correlation between binary responses within subjects, but a
negative correlation can occur with MRCV data. Their recommended
modeling method, a generalized loglinear model fit through generalized
estimating equation (GEE) methodology, can work reasonably well in very
large sample sizes [@Bilder+Loughin+Nettleton:2000]. The help file for
`MI.test()` shows how to use functions in the
[***geepack***](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=geepack) package
[@Yan+Hojsgaard+Halekoh:2012] to estimate this model and then
subsequently test for MMI via a Wald test.

We envision future additions to the package that will allow for
extensions to other situations. For example, "choose all that apply"
questions are often asked in complex survey sampling settings.
@Bilder+Loughin:2009 propose using the same generalized loglinear
models, where now different Rao-Scott adjustments are needed to take
into account the sampling design. Also, MRCV data can arise over a
longitudinal setting, and @Suesse+Liu:2013 propose the use of GEE
methodology to fit models for this situation. Finally,
@Nandram+Toto+Katzoff:2009 offer a Bayesian perspective to the MMI
testing problem. Due to the ubiquitous nature of "choose all that apply"
type data formats, we expect there to be many other unique settings
where new statistical methods need to be developed. We encourage readers
to contact us about their novel methods and/or interest in
collaboration.
