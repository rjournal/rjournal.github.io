title: 'MRCV: A Package for Analyzing Categorical Variables with Multiple Response
  Options'
abstract: Multiple response categorical variables (MRCVs), also known as “pick any”
  or “choose all that apply” variables, summarize survey questions for which respondents
  are allowed to select more than one category response option. Traditional methods
  for analyzing the association between categorical variables are not appropriate
  with MRCVs due to the within-subject dependence among responses. We have developed
  the MRCV package as the first R package available to correctly analyze MRCV data.
  Statistical methods offered by our package include counterparts to traditional Pearson
  chi-square tests for independence and loglinear models, where bootstrap methods
  and Rao-Scott adjustments are relied on to obtain valid inferences. We demonstrate
  the primary functions within the package by analyzing data from a survey assessing
  the swine waste management practices of Kansas farmers.
