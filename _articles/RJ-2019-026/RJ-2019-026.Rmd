title: 'ciuupi: An R package for Computing Confidence Intervals that Utilize Uncertain
  Prior Information'
abstract: We have created the R package ciuupi to compute confidence intervals that
  utilize uncertain prior information in linear regression. Unlike post-model-selection
  confidence intervals, the confidence interval that utilizes uncertain prior information
  (CIUUPI) implemented in this package has, to an excellent approximation, coverage
  probability throughout the parameter space that is very close to the desired minimum
  coverage probability. Furthermore, when the uncertain prior information is correct,
  the CIUUPI is, on average, shorter than the standard confidence interval constructed
  using the full linear regression model. In this paper we provide motivating examples
  of scenarios where the CIUUPI may be used. We then give a detailed description of
  this interval and the numerical constrained optimization method implemented in R
  to obtain it. Lastly, using a real data set as an illustrative example, we show
  how to use the functions in ciuupi.
