title: Numerical Evaluation of the Gauss Hypergeometric Function with the hypergeo
  Package
abstract: This paper introduces the hypergeo package of R routines for numerical calculation
  of hypergeometric functions. The package is focussed on efficient and accurate evaluation
  of the Gauss hypergeometric function over the whole of the complex plane within
  the constraints of fixed-precision arithmetic. The hypergeometric series is convergent
  only within the unit circle, so analytic continuation must be used to define the
  function outside the unit circle. This short document outlines the numerical and
  conceptual methods used in the package; and justifies the package philosophy, which
  is to maintain transparent and verifiable links between the software and Abramowitz
  and Stegun (1965). Most of the package functionality is accessed via the single
  function hypergeo(), which dispatches to one of several methods depending on the
  value of its arguments. The package is demonstrated in the context of game theory.
