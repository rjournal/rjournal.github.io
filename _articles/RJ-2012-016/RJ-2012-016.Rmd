title: What's in a Name?
abstract: Any shape that is drawn using the grid graphics package can have a name
  associated with it. If a name is provided, it is possible to access, query, and
  modify the shape after it has been drawn. These facilities allow for very detailed
  customisations of plots and also for very general transformations of plots that
  are drawn by packages based on grid.
