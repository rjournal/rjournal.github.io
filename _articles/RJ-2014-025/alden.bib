abstract = {Development of an in vitro living cell-based model of the intestine that mimics the mechanical, structural, absorptive, transport and pathophysiological properties of the human gut along with its crucial microbial symbionts could accelerate pharmaceutical development, and potentially replace animal testing. Here, we describe a biomimetic 'human gut-on-a-chip' microdevice composed of two microfluidic channels separated by a porous flexible membrane coated with extracellular matrix (ECM) and lined by human intestinal epithelial (Caco-2) cells that mimics the complex structure and physiology of living intestine. The gut microenvironment is recreated by flowing fluid at a low rate (30 $\mu$L h(-1)) producing low shear stress (0.02 dyne cm(-2)) over the microchannels, and by exerting cyclic strain (10\%; 0.15 Hz) that mimics physiological peristaltic motions. Under these conditions, a columnar epithelium develops that polarizes rapidly, spontaneously grows into folds that recapitulate the structure of intestinal villi, and forms a high integrity barrier to small molecules that better mimics whole intestine than cells in cultured in static Transwell models. In addition, a normal intestinal microbe (Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG) can be successfully co-cultured for extended periods (>1 week) on the luminal surface of the cultured epithelium without compromising epithelial cell viability, and this actually improves barrier function as previously observed in humans. Thus, this gut-on-a-chip recapitulates multiple dynamic physical and functional features of human intestine that are critical for its function within a controlled microfluidic environment that is amenable for transport, absorption, and toxicity studies, and hence it should have great value for drug testing as well as development of novel intestinal disease models.},

abstract = {The development of accurate computational models of biological processes is fundamental to computational systems biology. These models are usually represented by mathematical expressions that rely heavily on the system parameters. The measurement of these parameters is often difficult. Therefore, they are commonly estimated by fitting the predicted model to the experimental data using optimization methods. The complexity and nonlinearity of the biological processes pose a significant challenge, however, to the development of accurate and fast optimization methods. We introduce a new hybrid optimization method incorporating the Firefly Algorithm and the evolutionary operation of the Differential Evolution method. The proposed method improves solutions by neighbourhood search using evolutionary procedures. Testing our method on models for the arginine catabolism and the negative feedback loop of the p53 signalling pathway, we found that it estimated the parameters with high accuracy and within a reasonable computation time compared to well-known approaches, including Particle Swarm Optimization, Nelder-Mead, and Firefly Algorithm. We have also verified the reliability of the parameters estimated by the method using an a posteriori practical identifiability test.},

abstract = {The animal and human intestinal mucosa secretes an assortment of compounds to establish a physical barrier between the host tissue and intestinal contents, a separation that is vital for health. Some pathogenic microorganisms as well as members of the commensal intestinal microbiota have been shown to be able to break down these secreted compounds. Our understanding of host-compound degradation by the commensal microbiota has been limited to knowledge about simplified model systems because of the difficulty in studying the complex intestinal ecosystem in vivo. In this study, we introduce an approach that overcomes previous technical limitations and allows us to observe which microbial cells in the intestine use host-derived compounds. We added stable isotope-labeled threonine i.v. to mice and combined fluorescence in situ hybridization with high-resolution secondary ion mass spectrometry imaging to characterize utilization of host proteins by individual bacterial cells. We show that two bacterial species, Bacteroides acidifaciens and Akkermansia muciniphila, are important host-protein foragers in vivo. Using gnotobiotic mice we show that microbiota composition determines the magnitude and pattern of foraging by these organisms, demonstrating that a complex microbiota is necessary in order for this niche to be fully exploited. These results underscore the importance of in vivo studies of intestinal microbiota, and the approach presented in this study will be a powerful tool to address many other key questions in animal and human microbiome research.},

Besides an important local contribution in the host defense against infections, it has become increasingly clear that intestinal bacteria also modulate immune responses at systemic sites. These new insights can be of profound clinical relevance especially for intensive care medicine where the majority of patients are treated with antibiotics, which have pervasive and long-term effects on the intestinal microbiota. Moreover, considerable progress has been made in defining the role of the intestinal microbiota in both health and disease. In this review, we highlight these aspects and focus on recent key findings addressing the role of intestinal microbiota in antimicrobial defense mechanisms and its impact on intestinal homeostasis in the critically ill.},

@article{Lardon2011,
abstract = {Individual-based modelling of biofilms accounts for the fact that individual organisms of the same species may well be in a different physiological state as a result of environmental gradients, lag times in responding to change, or noise in gene expression, which we have become increasingly aware of with the advent of single-cell microbiology. But progress in developing and using individual-based modelling has been hampered by different groups writing their own code and the lack of an available standard model. We therefore set out to merge most features of previous models and incorporate various improvements in order to provide a common basis for further developments. Four improvements stand out: the biofilm pressure field allows for shrinking or consolidating biofilms; the continuous-in-time extracellular polymeric substances excretion leads to more realistic fluid behaviour of the extracellular matrix, avoiding artefacts; the stochastic chemostat mode allows comparison of spatially uniform and heterogeneous systems; and the separation of growth kinetics from the individual cell allows condition-dependent switching of metabolism. As an illustration of the model's use, we used the latter feature to study how environmentally fluctuating oxygen availability affects the diversity and composition of a community of denitrifying bacteria that induce the denitrification pathway under anoxic or low oxygen conditions. We tested the hypothesis that the existence of these diverse strategies of denitrification can be explained solely by assuming that faster response incurs higher costs. We found that if the ability to switch metabolic pathways quickly incurs no costs the fastest responder is always the best. However, if there is a trade-off where faster switching incurs higher costs, then there is a strategy with optimal response time for any frequency of environmental fluctuations, suggesting that different types of denitrifying strategies win in different environments. In a single environment, biodiversity of denitrifiers is higher in biofilms than chemostats, higher with than without costs and higher at intermediate frequency of change. The highly modular nature of the new computational model made this case study straightforward to implement, and reflects the sort of novel studies that can easily be executed with the new model.},

In order to investigate the influence of spatial heterogeneities on viral spread, a simple 2-D cellular automaton (CA) model of a viral infection has been developed. In this initial phase of the investigation, the CA model is validated against clinical immunological data for uncomplicated influenza A infections. Our results will be shown and discussed.},

SIS is based on descriptive cellular states and rules that define transitions between these states to model an entire immune system. Through the use of this program, an immunologist can test the validity of a proposed model by observing how it responds to self and non-self antigen. The output is then compared with the behavior of a real protective immune system, and the model can then be ruled as being adequate or inadequate. SIS-I, the first version of SIS written, has been modified through the years and is now available on our Web site: (http://www.cig.salk.edu/sis-I/sis.html). Although SIS-I has some flexibility, it has many hardwired values as well as a predefined keyword language for writing immune system rules. SIS-II was developed from SIS-I and allows the user to change more variables and to define keywords used within the program. Herein, we give an overview on how to use SIS-I and SIS-II, along with a future direction, SIS-III.},

abstract = {Homeostatic chemokines participate in the development of secondary lymphoid organs and later on in the functional organization of these tissues. The development of lymph nodes (LNs) and Peyer's patches depends on the recruitment of CD3- CD4+ interleukin (IL)-7R alpha hi cells to sites of future organ development. CD3- CD4+ IL-7R alpha hi cells express the chemokine receptor CXCR5 and might be attracted by its ligand CXCL13, which is secreted by mesenchymal cells. Mesenchymal cells also secrete CCL19, a ligand for CCR7, yet it is not clear whether CCR7 and CCL19 are important for secondary lymphoid organ development. Analyzing CXCR5-/- CCR7-/- double deficient mice we now show that these mice lack all examined peripheral LNs suggesting a profound role for both receptors in secondary lymphoid organ development. We demonstrate that CD3- CD4+ IL-7R alpha hi cells express CXCR5 as well as CCR7 indicating that both receptors cooperate during an early step of secondary lymphoid organ development. Furthermore, CXCR5-/- CCR7-/- mice display a severely disturbed architecture of mesenteric LN and spleen. Due to an impaired migration of B cells into the white pulp, CXCR5-/- CCR7-/- mice fail to develop B cell follicles but show small clusters of unorganized lymphocytes in the spleen. These data demonstrate a cooperative function of CXCR5 and CCR7 in lymphoid organ organogenesis and organization.},

RA simulation revealed a previously unidentified role of thymocyte competition for major histocompatability complex presentation.

abstract = {Relatively little is known about the viral factors contributing to the lethality of the 1918 pandemic, although its unparalleled virulence was likely due in part to the newly discovered PB1-F2 protein. This protein, while unnecessary for replication, increases apoptosis in monocytes, alters viral polymerase activity in vitro, enhances inflammation and increases secondary pneumonia in vivo. However, the effects the PB1-F2 protein have in vivo remain unclear. To address the mechanisms involved, we intranasally infected groups of mice with either influenza A virus PR8 or a genetically engineered virus that expresses the 1918 PB1-F2 protein on a PR8 background, PR8-PB1-F2(1918). Mice inoculated with PR8 had viral concentrations peaking at 72 hours, while those infected with PR8-PB1-F2(1918) reached peak concentrations earlier, 48 hours. Mice given PR8-PB1-F2(1918) also showed a faster decline in viral loads. We fit a mathematical model to these data to estimate parameter values. The model supports a higher viral production rate per cell and a higher infected cell death rate with the PR8-PB1-F2(1918) virus. We discuss the implications these mechanisms have during an infection with a virus expressing a virulent PB1-F2 on the possibility of a pandemic and on the importance of antiviral treatments.},

abstract = {We identified an IL-7Ralpha(+)Sca-1(low)c-Kit(low) population in E14 fetal liver, which is the phenotypical analog of common lymphoid progenitors (CLP) in adult bone marrow. After transfer into newborn mice, the IL-7Ralpha(+)Sca-1(low)c-Kit(low) population rapidly differentiated into CD45(+)CD4(+)CD3(-) cells, which are candidate cells for initiating lymph node and Peyer's patch formation. In addition, this population also gave rise to B, T, NK, and CD8alpha(+) and CD8alpha(-) dendritic cells. The fetal liver precursors expressed a significantly lower level of the myeloid-suppressing transcription factor Pax-5, than adult CLP, and retained differentiation activity for macrophages in vitro. We propose that the transition from fetal liver IL-7Ralpha(+)Sca-1(low)c-Kit(low) cells to adult CLP involves a regulated restriction of their developmental potential, controlled, at least in part, by Pax-5 expression.},

abstract = {The signaling network underlying eukaryotic chemosensing is a complex combination of receptor-mediated transmembrane signals, lipid modifications, protein translocations, and differential activation/deactivation of membrane-bound and cytosolic components. As such, it provides particularly interesting challenges for a combined computational and experimental analysis. We developed a novel detailed molecular signaling model that, when used to simulate the response to the attractant cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP), made nontrivial predictions about Dictyostelium chemosensing. These predictions, including the unexpected existence of spatially asymmetrical, multiphasic, cyclic adenosine monophosphate-induced PTEN translocation and phosphatidylinositol-(3,4,5)P3 generation, were experimentally verified by quantitative single-cell microscopy leading us to propose significant modifications to the current standard model for chemoattractant-induced biochemical polarization in this organism. Key to this successful modeling effort was the use of "Simmune," a new software package that supports the facile development and testing of detailed computational representations of cellular behavior. An intuitive interface allows user definition of complex signaling networks based on the definition of specific molecular binding site interactions and the subcellular localization of molecules. It automatically translates such inputs into spatially resolved simulations and dynamic graphical representations of the resulting signaling network that can be explored in a manner that closely parallels wet lab experimental procedures. These features of Simmune were critical to the model development and analysis presented here and are likely to be useful in the computational investigation of many aspects of cell biology.},

Finds that PP are not necessary for the induction of oral tolerance to soluble antigen, as three different types of mice lacking PP could be orally tolerised.  Furthermore, our results are consistent with an early report by Enders et al in which oral tolerance to sheep red blood cells was induced in rats that had surgical removal of PP"

The model differs from earlier approaches in using a dynamic movement on a lattice-free cylindrical surface. Cell movement is a consequence of mitotic activity. Cells interact by viscoelastic forces. Voronoi tessellation permits simulations of individual cell boundaries. Simulations can be compared with experimental data obtained from cell scoring in sections. Simulation studies show that the model is consistent with the experimental results for the spatial distribution of labelling indices, mitotic indices and other observed phenomena using a fixed number of stem cells and a fixed number of transit cell divisions.},
annote = {First paper that uses a "lattice free" model of the intestinal crypt - get the feeling we will be basing a lot of our work around this. Uses voronoi tesselation to calculate the cell boundaries, but cells continuously move using forces and springs.

        
Enhances previous rectangular based models where movement is directly related to insertion and deletion of cells. This link is biologically implausible.

        
Notes that there are biological reference sets out there - see Kaur \& Potten 1986 paper

        
Also notes that Honda used Voronoi in 1978 - this is a reference worth looking up - use in rat intestines.

        
Good equations for calculating force and cell displacement per timestep, we may copy these in our work, but these will need some explaining. When new cells are added the voronoi controls  new cell boundaries detected by cell movement.

        
Simulation loop (which we could pretty much pickup): 
- perform delauney triangulation to get neighbours
- calculate forces
- move cells
- age cells and divide

Key points:
- Show that migration of LTin/LTi cells is activated and regulated by VCAM \& ICAM expressing cells
- Flow cytometry used to show that VCAM/ICAM producing cells were not hematopoietic, not vascular endothelial, and not non mesenchymal - so are of mesenchymal origin
- Whereas Mebius et al found the CXCR5 receptor expressed, this paper also finds the CCR7 receptor expression
- Examined whether the VCAM/ICAM producing cells are responsible for the production of chemokines
- "A striking feature of PP inducers and organisers is the extent to which they are mutually complementary.  PP inducer cells express LTalpha/beta to activate PP organiser, while PP organisers express chemokines to activate PP inducers"
- "It thus appears likely that VCAM/ICAM cells are induced by LTalpha/beta on the surface of PP inducers that are expressed in response to IL-7R signals" - role for IL-7
        
- State th difficulty they have had trying to determine the location where this all happens
        
- "reaction-diffusion model" (Turing 1938) - PP position determined by interaction between two diffussible factors, one of which is essential for the initiating of the development process.  States though this is difficult to prove - though examples exist (i.e. fish stripes)},

abstract = {The systems biology community is building increasingly complex models and simulations of cells and other biological entities, and are beginning to look at alternatives to traditional representations such as those provided by ordinary differential equations (ODE). The lessons learned over the years by the software development community in designing and building increasingly complex telecommunication and other commercial real-time reactive systems, can be advantageously applied to the problems of modeling in the biology domain. Making use of the object-oriented (OO) paradigm, the unified modeling language (UML) and Real-Time Object-Oriented Modeling (ROOM) visual formalisms, and the Rational Rose RealTime (RRT) visual modeling tool, we describe a multi-step process we have used to construct top-down models of cells and cell aggregates. The simple example model described in this paper includes membranes with lipid bilayers, multiple compartments including a variable number of mitochondria, substrate molecules, enzymes with reaction rules, and metabolic pathways. We demonstrate the relevance of abstraction, reuse, objects, classes, component and inheritance hierarchies, multiplicity, visual modeling, and other current software development best practices. We show how it is possible to start with a direct diagrammatic representation of a biological structure such as a cell, using terminology familiar to biologists, and by following a process of gradually adding more and more detail, arrive at a system with structure and behavior of arbitrary complexity that can run and be observed on a computer. We discuss our CellAK (Cell Assembly Kit) approach in terms of features found in SBML, CellML, E-CELL, Gepasi, Jarnac, StochSim, Virtual Cell, and membrane computing systems.},

abstract = {The analysis of hemodynamic parameters and functional reactivity of cerebral capillaries is still controversial. To assess the hemodynamic parameters in the cortical capillary network, a generic model was created using 2D voronoi tessellation in which each edge represents a capillary segment. This method is capable of creating an appropriate generic model of cerebral capillary network relating to each part of the brain cortex because the geometric model is able to vary the capillary density. The modeling presented here is based on morphometric parameters extracted from physiological data of the human cortex. The pertinent hemodynamic parameters were obtained by numerical simulation based on effective blood viscosity as a function of hematocrit and microvessel diameter, phase separation and plasma skimming effects. The hemodynamic parameters of capillary networks with two different densities (consistent with the variation of the morphometric data in the human cortical capillary network) were analyzed. The results show pertinent hemodynamic parameters for each model. The heterogeneity (coefficient variation) and the mean value of hematocrits, flow rates and velocities of the both network models were specified. The distributions of blood flow throughout the both models seem to confirm the hypothesis in which all capillaries in a cortical network are recruited at rest (normal condition). The results also demonstrate a discrepancy of the network resistance between two models, which are derived from the difference in the number density of capillary segments between the models.},

abstract = {Analyses of the taxonomic diversity associated with the human microbiome continue to be an area of great importance. The study of the nature and extent of the commonly shared taxa ("core"), versus those less prevalent, establishes a baseline for comparing healthy and diseased groups by quantifying the variation among people, across body habitats and over time. The National Institutes of Health (NIH) sponsored Human Microbiome Project (HMP) has provided an unprecedented opportunity to examine and better define what constitutes the taxonomic core within and across body habitats and individuals through pyrosequencing-based profiling of 16S rRNA gene sequences from oral, skin, distal gut (stool), and vaginal body habitats from over 200 healthy individuals. A two-parameter model is introduced to quantitatively identify the core taxonomic members of each body habitat's microbiota across the healthy cohort. Using only cutoffs for taxonomic ubiquity and abundance, core taxonomic members were identified for each of the 18 body habitats and also for the 4 higher-level body regions. Although many microbes were shared at low abundance, they exhibited a relatively continuous spread in both their abundance and ubiquity, as opposed to a more discretized separation. The numbers of core taxa members in the body regions are comparatively small and stable, reflecting the relatively high, but conserved, interpersonal variability within the cohort. Core sizes increased across the body regions in the order of: vagina, skin, stool, and oral cavity. A number of "minor" oral taxonomic core were also identified by their majority presence across the cohort, but with relatively low and stable abundances. A method for quantifying the difference between two cohorts was introduced and applied to samples collected on a second visit, revealing that over time, the oral, skin, and stool body regions tended to be more transient in their taxonomic structure than the vaginal body region.},

abstract = {The oxygen exchange and correlation between the cerebral blood flow (CBF) and cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen consumption (CMRO2) in the cortical capillary levels for normal and pathologic brain functions remain the subject of debate. A 3D realistic mesoscale model of the cortical capillary network (non-tree like) is constructed using a random Voronoi tessellation in which each edge represents a capillary segment. The hemodynamics and oxygen transport are numerically simulated in the model, which involves rheological laws in the capillaries, oxygen diffusion, and non-linear binding of oxygen to hemoglobin, respectively. The findings show that the cerebral hypoxia due to a significant decreased perfusion (as can occur in stroke) can be avoided by a moderate reduction in oxygen demand. Oxygen extraction fraction (OEF) can be an important indicator for the brain oxygen metabolism under normal perfusion and misery-perfusion syndrome (leading to ischemia). The results demonstrated that a disproportionately large increase in blood supply is required for a small increase in the oxygen demand, which, in turn, is strongly dependent on the resting OEF. The predicted flow-metabolism coupling in the model supports the experimental studies of spatiotemporal stimulations in humans by positron emission tomography and functional magnetic resonance imaging.Journal of Cerebral Blood Flow \& Metabolism advance online publication, 7 August 2013; doi:10.1038/jcbfm.2013.119.},

abstract = {The use of fibre-reinforced polymer matrix composite materials is growing at a faster rate than the gross domestic product (GDP) in many countries. An improved understanding of their processing and mechanical behaviour would extend the potential applications of these materials. For unidirectional composites, it is predicted that localized absence of fibres is related to longitudinal compression failure. The use of woven reinforcements permits more effective manufacture than for unidirectional fibres. It has been demonstrated experimentally that compression strengths of woven composites are reduced when fibres are clustered. Summerscales predicted that clustering of fibres would increase the permeability of the reinforcement and hence expedite the processing of these materials. Commercial fabrics are available which employ this concept using flow-enhancing bound tows. The net effect of clustering fibres is to enhance processability whilst reducing the mechanical properties. The effects reported above were qualitative correlations. To improve the design tools for reinforcement fabrics we have sought to quantify the changes in the micro/meso-structure of woven reinforcement fabrics. Gross differences in the appearance of laminate sections are apparent for different weave styles. The use of automated image analysis is essential for the quantification of subtle changes in fabric architecture. This paper considers Voronoi tessellation and fractal dimensions for the quantification of the microstructures of woven fibre-reinforced composites. It reviews our studies in the last decade of the process-property-structure relationships for commercial and experimental fabric reinforcements in an attempt to resolve the processing vs. properties dilemma. A new flow-enhancement concept has been developed which has a reduced impact on laminate mechanical properties.},

abstract = {We study multicellular tumor spheroids by introducing a new three-dimensional agent-based Voronoi-Delaunay hybrid model. In this model, the cell shape varies from spherical in thin solution to convex polyhedral in dense tissues. The next neighbors of the cells are provided by a weighted Delaunay triangulation with on average linear computational complexity. The cellular interactions include direct elastic forces and cell-cell as well as cell-matrix adhesion. The spatiotemporal distribution of two nutrients--oxygen and glucose--is described by reaction-diffusion equations. Viable cells consume the nutrients, which are converted into biomass by increasing the cell size during the G1 phase. We test hypotheses on the functional dependence of the uptake rates and use computer simulations to find suitable mechanisms for the induction of necrosis. This is done by comparing the outcome with experimental growth curves, where the best fit leads to an unexpected ratio of oxygen and glucose uptake rates. The model relies on physical quantities and can easily be generalized towards tissues involving different cell types. In addition, it provides many features that can be directly compared with the experiment.},

abstract = {Voronoi tessellations have been used to model the geometric arrangement of cells in morphogenetic or cancerous tissues, however, so far only with flat hyper-surfaces as cell-cell contact borders. In order to reproduce the experimentally observed piecewise spherical boundary shapes, we develop a consistent theoretical framework of multiplicatively weighted distance functions, defining generalized finite Voronoi neighborhoods around cell bodies of varying radius, which serve as heterogeneous generators of the resulting model tissue. The interactions between cells are represented by adhesive and repelling force densities on the cell contact borders. In addition, protrusive locomotion forces are implemented along the cell boundaries at the tissue margin, and stochastic perturbations allow for non-deterministic motility effects. Simulations of the emerging system of stochastic differential equations for position and velocity of cell centers show the feasibility of this Voronoi method generating realistic cell shapes. In the limiting case of a single cell pair in brief contact, the dynamical nonlinear Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process is analytically investigated. In general, topologically distinct tissue conformations are observed, exhibiting stability on different time scales, and tissue coherence is quantified by suitable characteristics. Finally, an argument is derived pointing to a tradeoff in natural tissues between cell size heterogeneity and the extension of cellular lamellae.},

abstract = {During murine embryogenesis, the formation of Peyer's patches (PPs) is initiated by CD45(+)CD4(+)CD3(-) lymphoid tissue inducers that trigger adhesion molecule expression and specific chemokine production from an organizing stromal cell population through ligation of the lymphotoxin-beta receptor. However, the steps involved in the development of lymph nodes (LNs) are less clear than those of PPs, and the characteristics of the organizing cells within the LN anlagen have yet to be documented. In this study, we show for the first time that the early anlage is bordered by an endothelial layer that retains a mixed lymphatic and blood vascular phenotype up to embryonic day 16.5. This in turn encompasses CD45(+)CD4(+)CD3(-) cells interspersed with ICAM-1/VCAM-1/mucosal addressin cell adhesion molecule-1, lymphotoxin-beta receptor-positive, chemokine-producing cells analogous to the organizing population previously observed in PPs. Moreover, these LN organizers also express the TNF family member, TRANCE. Lastly, we show that the ICAM-1/VCAM-1/mucosal addressin cell adhesion molecule-1 cells present in peripheral and mesenteric LN form two discrete populations expressing either intermediate or high levels of these adhesion molecules but that the former population is specifically reduced in PLN. These findings provide a possible explanation for the well-known differences in developmental requirements for nodes at peripheral or mesenteric locations.},

abstract = {Hematopoietic lymphoid tissue inducer (LTi) cells initiate lymph node (LN) and Peyer's patch (PP) development during fetal life by inducing the differentiation of mesenchymal organizer cells. The growth factor signals underlying LTi cell development and LN and PP organogenesis remain poorly understood. LTi cells express the Il7r and the receptor tyrosine kinase Kit, whereas organizer cells express their cognate ligands. To determine the relative significance of Il7 and Kit signaling in LTi cell homeostasis and PP and LN development, we have analyzed mice deficient for Kit (Kit(W/Wv)), Il7 (Il7(-/-)), or both (Il7(-/-) Kit(W/Wv)). Unlike Kit(W/Wv) and Il7(-/-) single mutants, Il7(-/-) Kit(W/Wv) mice were almost devoid of LTi cells in their mesenteric LN anlage. This LTi deficiency was associated with a block in mesenchymal LN organizer cell generation and the absence of almost all LNs. In contrast, intestinal LTi cell numbers, PP organizer cell generation, and PP development were strongly affected by impaired Kit signaling, but were independent of Il7. Hence, Kit and Il7 act synergistically in LN organogenesis, whereas Kit signaling, but not Il7, critically regulates PP organogenesis and LTi cell numbers in the intestine. Consistent with these differential growth factor requirements for PP and LN development, PP organizer cells expressed higher Kitl and lower Il7 levels than did LN organizer cells. Collectively, these results demonstrate that Kit and Il7 differentially control PP and LN organogenesis through the local growth factor-driven regulation of LTi cell numbers.},

abstract = {The desire to understand tumor complexity has given rise to mathematical models to describe the tumor microenvironment. We present a new mathematical model for avascular tumor growth and development that spans three distinct scales. At the cellular level, a lattice Monte Carlo model describes cellular dynamics (proliferation, adhesion, and viability). At the subcellular level, a Boolean network regulates the expression of proteins that control the cell cycle. At the extracellular level, reaction-diffusion equations describe the chemical dynamics (nutrient, waste, growth promoter, and inhibitor concentrations). Data from experiments with multicellular spheroids were used to determine the parameters of the simulations. Starting with a single tumor cell, this model produces an avascular tumor that quantitatively mimics experimental measurements in multicellular spheroids. Based on the simulations, we predict: 1), the microenvironmental conditions required for tumor cell survival; and 2), growth promoters and inhibitors have diffusion coefficients in the range between 10(-6) and 10(-7) cm2/h, corresponding to molecules of size 80-90 kDa. Using the same parameters, the model also accurately predicts spheroid growth curves under different external nutrient supply conditions.},

Our study is based on our previous model that simulates the cancer vs immune system competition activated by tumor vaccine. This model accurately reproduces in-vivo experiments results on HER-2/neu mice treated with the immuno-prevention cancer vaccine (Triplex) for mammary carcinoma. In vivo experiments have shown the effectiveness of Triplex vaccine in protection of mice from mammary carcinoma. The full protection was conferred using chronic (prophylactic) vaccination protocol while therapeutic vaccination was less efficient. In the present paper we use the computer simulations to systematically search for a vaccination schedule which prevents solid tumor formation. The strategy we used for defining a successful vaccination schedule is to control the number of cancer cells with vaccination cycles. We found that, applying the vaccination scheme used in in-vivo experiments, the number of vaccine injections can be reduced roughly by 30\%.},

Although many details are known about the cells and molecules involved, a broader "systems engineering" view of this complex system is just beginning to emerge. Here the argument is put forward that stochastic events, potent amplification mechanisms, feedback controls, and heterogeneity arising from spatially dispersed cell interactions give rise to many of the gross properties of the immune system.

abstract = {To date, the majority of theoretical models describing the dynamics of infectious diseases in vivo are based on the assumption of well-mixed virus and cell populations. Because many infections take place in solid tissues, spatially structured models represent an important step forward in understanding what happens when the assumption of well-mixed populations is relaxed. Here, we explore models of virus and virus-immune dynamics where dispersal of virus and immune effector cells was constrained to occur locally. The stability properties of our spatial virus-immune dynamics models remained robust under almost all biologically plausible dispersal schemes, regardless of their complexity. The various spatial dynamics were compared to the basic non-spatial dynamics and important differences were identified: When space was assumed to be homogeneous, the dynamics generated by non-spatial and spatially structured models differed substantially at the peak of the infection. Thus, non-spatial models may lead to systematic errors in the estimates of parameters underlying acute infection dynamics. When space was assumed to be heterogeneous, spatial coupling not only changed the equilibrium properties of the uncoupled populations but also equalized the dynamics and thereby reduced the likelihood of dynamic elimination of the infection. In line with experimental and clinical observations, long-lasting oscillation periods were virtually absent. When source-sink dynamics were considered, the long-term outcome of the infection depended critically on the degree of spatial coupling. The infection collapsed when emigration from source sites became too large. Finally, we discuss the implications of spatially structured models on medical treatment of infectious diseases, and note that a huge gap exists in data accurately describing infection dynamics in solid tissues.},

abstract = {The complexity of the acute inflammatory response (AIR) is, by now, generally recognized. The primary manifestation of this property has been the difficulty in translating the information derived from reductionist, basic science research into effective clinical treatment regimens for sepsis. However, the recognition of the "complexity" of the AIR is not without its pitfalls. Despite its limitations, reductionism remains the primary means of obtaining scientific information. Furthermore, a functional shortcoming of use of the term complex has been to make it equivalent to "essentially unsolvable." Therefore, a mechanism is needed to integrate the apparatus of reductionist analysis into a complex synthetic methodology that overcomes the current limitations of both. Toward this end, I propose a structure for a class of collaborative, community-wide in silico models that use the framework of agent-based modeling. Agent-based modeling is a type of mathematical modeling that focuses on the behaviors of the components of complex systems and is well suited for translating the results of basic science experiments. I will also introduce a preliminary version of a syntactical "grammar" that can potentially be used to facilitate the transfer of basic science data into computer code. It is hoped that when a mature version of this framework is implemented, the resulting models will provide a functional, synthetic data base on the AIR that could be used for directing research, testing hypotheses, teaching and training, and drug discovery/testing.},

annote = {Making predictions on treationg pancreatic cancer using a mathematical model - in cell, very good for this technique.
        
Also gives a few references to other computational work:
Andasari 2011, Chauviere 2010, Dingli 2007, Jadhav 2007, Klein and Holzel 2006, Michor 2006, Quaranta 2008, Sherratt 2001
        
Points:
"This stochastic mathematical model serves to investigate the probability that metastases are present within a patient at a particular time during tumorigenesis, the total number of cancer cells, the effect of chemotherapy or chemoradiation and resection on these quantities, and the survival time of cancer patients.
        
Predicts that all patients harbour metastasis enabled cells in the primary tumour at time of diagnosis - not currently thought
        
Predictions:
- Suggests chemotherapy better than removal of 99.9\% of the tumour, as chemotherapy reduces growth rate of primary and metastatic tumour cells.
So suggests this is done early rather than surgical removal
- the number of metastatic cells is generally the determinant of death.  Chemotherapy leads to smaller metastatic cell sites, surgery leads to larger sites
- Found indices whichg forecast the prognosis of patients with statistical significance
        
- The biggest implication of this model is its predictions for timing of and type of clinical intervention that impact survival.
- Overall, our predictions suggest that chemotherapeutic agents capable of effectively reducing the growth rate of primary and metastatic tumours are most promising for prolonging survial of pancreatic cancer patients compared to surgery alone.
-Further our model suggests that surgery serves to debulk the overall tumour cell burden but does not fully eradicate it.  By extension, this prediction also infers that earlier initiation of effective chemotherapeutic agents has a survival benefit by reducing the number of cells in exponential growth stage, a finding of tremendous clinical significance in the light of ongoing debates regarding neoadjuvant versus adjuvant treatment of resected pancreatic cancers.
        
However, assumption:
- the cells may have a different growth rate, which was not considered in the present study for clarity. Since detailed knowledge of these parameters is important for the determination of accurate mathematical formulation and thus the dynamics of metastasis and identification of optimum treatment strategies,, it is an important goal of the field to obtain these values from detailed kinetic studies of cancer cells.},

abstract = {Lymphoid tissue development is associated with local accumulation of CD4+ CD3- IL-7R alpha hi hematopoietic cells that deliver lymphotoxin (LT)alpha 1 beta 2 signals to resident stromal cells. Previous studies have established an important role for CXCL13 (BLC) in the development of Peyer's patches (PP) and some peripheral lymph nodes (LNs), but the chemokine requirements for several LN types, including mesenteric LNs, remain undefined. Using CXCL13-/- mice that additionally carry the paucity of LN T cell mutation (plt/plt), we discovered that CCR7 ligands function in peripheral LN development. We also tested for a genetic interaction during LN development between CXCL13 and a cytokine receptor required in PP development, IL-7R alpha. Mice deficient for both CXCL13 and IL-7R alpha displayed a striking absence of LNs, including mesenteric LNs. These data extend the role of CXCL13 to the development of all LNs and establish a previously unappreciated role for IL-7R alpha in this process. Both circulating and LN CD4+ CD3- IL-7R alpha hi cells are shown to express LT alpha 1 beta 2 in an IL-7R alpha-dependent manner. Furthermore, CXCL13 was found to be sufficient to mediate CD4+ CD3- IL-7R alpha hi cell recruitment in vivo to an ectopic site. These findings indicate that CXCL13 and CCR7 ligands promote accumulation of CD4+ CD3- IL-7R alpha hi cells, delivering IL-7R alpha-dependent LT alpha 1 beta 2 signals critical for LN development.},

It is attained by several underlying principles that are universal to both biological organisms and sophisticated engineering systems. Robustness facilitates evolvability and robust traits are often selected by evolution. Such a mutually beneficial process is made possible by specific architectural features observed in robust systems. But there are trade-offs between robustness, fragility, performance and resource demands, which explain system behaviour, including the patterns of failure. Insights into inherent properties of robust systems will provide us with a better understanding of complex diseases and a guiding principle for therapy design.},

The growing awareness that started in the mid-fifties of the previous century has shifted the emphasis of immunology from a molecular, mostly serological science to the cell-oriented modern immunology of today. Matters such as hematopoietic differentiation, cell-cell interaction, cellular activation, as well as migratory behavior of hematopoietic cells received much attention and deepened our insight in the immune system. The relatively recent generation of mutant mice lacking lymphoid organs prompted the realization that the organogenesis of lymphoid organs could be dissected at the cellular and molecular level. Now we can distinguish several phases of development for lymphoid organs, and can assign molecules and cells to be essentially involved in these phases. Future research will identify additional molecules and cells required for the formation of the various lymphoid organs, because the picture is not complete yet.},

Adaptive system behaviour emerges via these interactions, which integrate the activity of the sub-units. To understand the system level it is necessary to understand the underlying local interactions. Successful models of local interactions at different levels of biological organisation, including epithelial tissue and ant colonies, have demonstrated the benefits of such 'agent-based' modelling. Here we present an agent-based approach to modelling a crucial biological system--the intracellular NF-kappaB signalling pathway. The pathway is vital to immune response regulation, and is fundamental to basic survival in a range of species. Alterations in pathway regulation underlie a variety of diseases, including atherosclerosis and arthritis. Our modelling of individual molecules, receptors and genes provides a more comprehensive outline of regulatory network mechanisms than previously possible with equation-based approaches. The method also permits consideration of structural parameters in pathway regulation; here we predict that inhibition of NF-kappaB is directly affected by actin filaments of the cytoskeleton sequestering excess inhibitors, therefore regulating steady-state and feedback behaviour.},

This is achieved by replacing the 'pushing' forces between cells with springs (in a similar way to the way our current method for eGUT works).  A spring exists between any cells which have overlapping EPS. Or where the cell is near a surface, there is an anchoring spring tieing the agent to the surface.

        
Note that measures only go one way - the paper does not examine the effect of flow on the biofilm itself

For example, we found that including virion loss due to cell entry was critical for the in vitro model but not for the in vivo model. Experiments were performed on influenza virus-infected MDCK cells in vitro inside a hollow-fiber (HF) system, which was used to continuously deliver the drug amantadine. The HF system captures the dynamics of an influenza infection, and is a controlled environment for producing experimental data which lend themselves well to mathematical modeling. The parameter estimates obtained from fitting our mathematical models to the HF experimental data are consistent with those obtained earlier for a primary infection in a human model. We found that influenza A/Albany/1/98 (H3N2) virions under normal experimental conditions at 37 degrees C rapidly lose infectivity with a half-life of approximately 6.6+/-0.2 h, and that the lifespan of productively infected MDCK cells is approximately 13 h. Finally, using our models we estimated that the maximum efficacy of amantadine in blocking viral infection is approximately 74\%, and showed that this low maximum efficacy is likely due to the rapid development of drug resistance.},

The springs are placed along each vertex  of the cell. It is these which are acting as  the cell boundaries. This is not the case for eGUT, where we are using voronoi to set volume boundaries, but have a radius of the cell that is the actual cell boundary. So the edge of the cell (and that affected by the forces) is the radius, not the voronoi. Once the forces have had their impact on the cell, we redraw the voronoi - so the forces need to act on the radius.},

Epithelial restitution occurs quickly to reestablish the barrier and comprises a major part of the immediate host response to injured tissue. Pathways involving transforming growth factor beta and activation of epidermal growth factor receptor are both of critical importance, although cross-pathway interactions have been poorly characterized. Agent-based modeling has been showed to be useful in integrating disparate bodies of knowledge and showing the dynamic consequences of pathway structures and cellular population behavior and is used herein to create an in silico analog of an in vitro scratch assay. The In Vitro Scratch Agent-Based Model consists of agents representing individual epithelial cells in a simulated extracellular matrix. Agents sense signals from the damaged environment and produce effector molecules, leading to their healing behavior. The In Vitro Scratch Agent-Based Model qualitatively matched wound healing dynamics when compared against data from traditional experiments. Putative cross-talk mechanisms were then instantiated into the In Vitro Scratch Agent-Based Model and their relative plausibility examined, suggesting interaction at the receptor tyrosine kinase level. This highlights the utility of dynamic knowledge representation in the integration of pathways previously studied in separate contexts.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: There is a growing recognition of the significance of host-pathogen interactions (HPIs) in gut biology leading to a reassessment of the role of bacteria in intestinal anastomotic leak. Understanding the complexities of the early postsurgical gut HPI requires integrating knowledge of both epithelial and bacterial behaviors to generate hypotheses of potential mechanisms of interaction. Agent-based modeling is a computational method well suited to achieve this goal, and we use an agent-based model (ABM) to examine alterations in the HPI affecting reestablishment of the epithelial barrier that may subsequently lead to anastomotic leak.

METHODS: Computational agents representing Pseudomonas aeruginosa were added to a previously validated ABM of epithelial restitution. Simulated experiments were performed examining the effect of radiation on bacterial binding to epithelial cells, plausibility of putative binding targets, and potential mechanisms of epithelial cell killing by virulent bacteria.

RESULTS: Simulation experiments incorporating radiation effects on epithelial monolayers produced binding patterns akin to those seen in vitro and suggested that promotility integrin-laminin associations represent potential sites for bacterial binding and disruption of restitution. Simulations of potential mechanisms of epithelial cell killing suggested that an injected cytotoxin was the means by which virulent bacteria produced the tissue destruction needed to generate an anastomotic leak, a mechanism subsequently confirmed with genotyping of the virulent P aeruginosa strain.

CONCLUSIONS: This study emphasizes the utility of ABM as an adjunct to traditional research methods and provides insights into the potentially critical role of HPI in the pathogenesis of anastomotic leak.},

abstract = {The development of detailed, coherent, models of complex biological systems is recognized as a key requirement for integrating the increasing amount of experimental data. In addition, in-silico simulation of bio-chemical models provides an easy way to test different experimental conditions, helping in the discovery of the dynamics that regulate biological systems. However, the computational power required by these simulations often exceeds that available on common desktop computers and thus expensive high performance computing solutions are required. An emerging alternative is represented by general-purpose scientific computing on graphics processing units (GPGPU), which offers the power of a small computer cluster at a cost of approximately \$400. Computing with a GPU requires the development of specific algorithms, since the programming paradigm substantially differs from traditional CPU-based computing. In this paper, we review some recent efforts in exploiting the processing power of GPUs for the simulation of biological systems.},

@article{Merkey2011,
abstract = {Plasmid invasion in biofilms is often surprisingly limited in spite of the close contact of cells in a biofilm. We hypothesized that this poor plasmid spread into deeper biofilm layers is caused by a dependence of conjugation on the growth rate (relative to the maximum growth rate) of the donor. By extending an individual-based model of microbial growth and interactions to include the dynamics of plasmid carriage and transfer by individual cells, we were able to conduct in silico tests of this and other hypotheses on the dynamics of conjugal plasmid transfer in biofilms. For a generic model plasmid, we find that invasion of a resident biofilm is indeed limited when plasmid transfer depends on growth, but not so in the absence of growth dependence. Using sensitivity analysis we also find that parameters related to timing (i.e. a lag before the transconjugant can transfer, transfer proficiency and scan speed) and spatial reach (EPS yield, conjugal pilus length) are more important for successful plasmid invasion than the recipients' growth rate or the probability of segregational loss. While this study identifies one factor that can limit plasmid invasion in biofilms, the new individual-based framework introduced in this work is a powerful tool that enables one to test additional hypotheses on the spread and role of plasmids in microbial biofilms.},

@article{Baccam2006,
abstract = {Currently, little is known about the viral kinetics of influenza A during infection within an individual. We utilize a series of mathematical models of increasing complexity, which incorporate target cell limitation and the innate interferon response, to examine influenza A virus kinetics in the upper respiratory tracts of experimentally infected adults. The models were fit to data from an experimental H1N1 influenza A/Hong Kong/123/77 infection and suggest that it is important to include the eclipse phase of the viral life cycle in viral dynamic models. Doing so, we estimate that after a delay of approximately 6 h, infected cells begin producing influenza virus and continue to do so for approximately 5 h. The average lifetime of infected cells is approximately 11 h, and the half-life of free infectious virus is approximately 3 h. We calculated the basic reproductive number, R(0), which indicated that a single infected cell could produce approximately 22 new productive infections. This suggests that antiviral treatments have a large hurdle to overcome in moderating symptoms and limiting infectiousness and that treatment has to be initiated as early as possible. For about 50\% of patients, the curve of viral titer versus time has two peaks. This bimodal behavior can be explained by incorporating the antiviral effects of interferon into the model. Our model also compared well to an additional data set on viral titer after experimental infection and treatment with the neuraminidase inhibitor zanamivir, which suggests that such models may prove useful in estimating the efficacies of different antiviral therapies for influenza A infection.},

@article{Gilchrist2006,
abstract = {The innate immune system is absolutely required for host defence, but, uncontrolled, it leads to inflammatory disease. This control is mediated, in part, by cytokines that are secreted by macrophages. Immune regulation is extraordinarily complex, and can be best investigated with systems approaches (that is, using computational tools to predict regulatory networks arising from global, high-throughput data sets). Here we use cluster analysis of a comprehensive set of transcriptomic data derived from Toll-like receptor (TLR)-activated macrophages to identify a prominent group of genes that appear to be regulated by activating transcription factor 3 (ATF3), a member of the CREB/ATF family of transcription factors. Network analysis predicted that ATF3 is part of a transcriptional complex that also contains members of the nuclear factor (NF)-kappaB family of transcription factors. Promoter analysis of the putative ATF3-regulated gene cluster demonstrated an over-representation of closely apposed ATF3 and NF-kappaB binding sites, which was verified by chromatin immunoprecipitation and hybridization to a DNA microarray. This cluster included important cytokines such as interleukin (IL)-6 and IL-12b. ATF3 and Rel (a component of NF-kappaB) were shown to bind to the regulatory regions of these genes upon macrophage activation. A kinetic model of Il6 and Il12b messenger RNA expression as a function of ATF3 and NF-kappaB promoter binding predicted that ATF3 is a negative regulator of Il6 and Il12b transcription, and this hypothesis was validated using Atf3-null mice. ATF3 seems to inhibit Il6 and Il12b transcription by altering chromatin structure, thereby restricting access to transcription factors. Because ATF3 is itself induced by lipopolysaccharide, it seems to regulate TLR-stimulated inflammatory responses as part of a negative-feedback loop.},

These modelling tools not only offer an additional avenue for exploring disease dynamics at multiple biological scales, but also complement and extend knowledge gained via experimental tools. In this review, we outline four examples where modelling has complemented current experimental techniques in a way that can or has already pushed our knowledge of host-pathogen dynamics forward. Two of the modelling approaches presented go hand in hand with articles in this issue exploring fluorescence resonance energy transfer and two-photon intravital microscopy. Two others explore virtual or 'in silico' deletion and depletion as well as a new method to understand and guide studies in genetic epidemiology. In each of these examples, the complementary nature of modelling and experiment is discussed. We further note that multi-scale modelling may allow us to integrate information across length (molecular, cellular, tissue, organism, population) and time (e.g. seconds to lifetimes). In sum, when combined, these compatible approaches offer new opportunities for understanding host-pathogen interactions.},

By their ability to transport luminal antigens and bacteria, PPs can be considered as the immune sensors of the intestine. PPs functions like induction of immune tolerance or defense against pathogens result from the complex interplay between immune cells located in the lymphoid follicles and the follicle-associated epithelium. This crosstalk seems to be regulated by pathogen recognition receptors, especially Nod2. Although TLR exerts a limited role in PP homeotasis, Nod2 regulates the number, size, and T-cell composition of PPs, in response to the gut flora. In turn, CD4(+) T-cells present in the PP are able to modulate the paracellular and transcellular permeabilities. Two human disorders, Crohn's disease and graft-versus-host disease are thought to be driven by an abnormal response toward the commensal flora. They have been associated with NOD2 mutations and PP dysfunction.},

abstract = {To clarify the role of Peyer's patches in oral tolerance induction, BALB/c mice were treated in utero with lymphotoxin beta-receptor Ig fusion protein to generate mice lacking Peyer's patches. When these Peyer's patch-null mice were fed 25 mg of ovalbumin (OVA) before systemic immunization, OVA-specific IgG Ab responses in serum and spleen were seen, in marked contrast to low responses in OVA-fed normal mice. Further, high T-cell-proliferative- and delayed-type hypersensitivity responses were seen in Peyer's patch-null mice given oral OVA before systemic challenge. Higher levels of CD4(+) T-cell-derived IFN-gamma, IL-4, IL-5, and IL-10 syntheses were noted in Peyer's patch-null mice fed OVA, whereas OVA-fed normal mice had suppressed cytokine levels. In contrast, oral administration of trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid (TNBS) to Peyer's patch-null mice resulted in reduced TNBS-specific serum Abs and splenic B cell antitrinitrophenyl Ab-forming cell responses after skin painting with picryl chloride. Further, when delayed-type hypersensitivity and splenic T cell proliferative responses were examined, Peyer's patch-null mice fed TNBS were unresponsive to hapten. Peyer's patch-null mice fed trinitrophenyl-OVA failed to induce systemic unresponsiveness to hapten or protein. These findings show that organized Peyer's patches are required for oral tolerance to proteins, whereas haptens elicit systemic unresponsiveness via the intestinal epithelial cell barrier.},

abstract = {Normal organogenesis requires co-ordinate development and interaction of multiple cell types, and is seemingly governed by tissue specific factors. Lymphoid organogenesis during embryonic life is dependent on molecules the temporal expression of which is tightly regulated. During this process, haematopoietic 'inducer' cells interact with stromal 'organizer' cells, giving rise to the lymphoid organ primordia. Here we show that the haematopoietic cells in the gut exhibit a random pattern of motility before aggregation into the primordia of Peyer's patches, a major component of the gut-associated lymphoid tissue. We further show that a CD45+CD4-CD3-Il7Ralpha-c-Kit+CD11c+ haematopoietic population expressing lymphotoxin has an important role in the formation of Peyer's patches. A subset of these cells expresses the receptor tyrosine kinase RET, which is essential for mammalian enteric nervous system formation. We demonstrate that RET signalling is also crucial for Peyer's patch formation. Functional genetic analysis revealed that Gfra3-deficiency results in impairment of Peyer's patch development, suggesting that the signalling axis RET/GFRalpha3/ARTN is involved in this process. To support this hypothesis, we show that the RET ligand ARTN is a strong attractant of gut haematopoietic cells, inducing the formation of ectopic Peyer's patch-like structures. Our work strongly suggests that the RET signalling pathway, by regulating the development of both the nervous and lymphoid system in the gut, has a key role in the molecular mechanisms that orchestrate intestine organogenesis.},

abstract = {Accuracy of results from mathematical and computer models of biological systems is often complicated by the presence of uncertainties in experimental data that are used to estimate parameter values. Current mathematical modeling approaches typically use either single-parameter or local sensitivity analyses. However, these methods do not accurately assess uncertainty and sensitivity in the system as, by default, they hold all other parameters fixed at baseline values. Using techniques described within we demonstrate how a multi-dimensional parameter space can be studied globally so all uncertainties can be identified. Further, uncertainty and sensitivity analysis techniques can help to identify and ultimately control uncertainties. In this work we develop methods for applying existing analytical tools to perform analyses on a variety of mathematical and computer models. We compare two specific types of global sensitivity analysis indexes that have proven to be among the most robust and efficient. Through familiar and new examples of mathematical and computer models, we provide a complete methodology for performing these analyses, in both deterministic and stochastic settings, and propose novel techniques to handle problems encountered during these types of analyses.},

The methods described include bioassays for soluble chemokine receptors, RNA extraction, RT-PCR, Real - time quantitative PCR, gene array analysis, northern blot analysis, Ribonuclease Protection assay, Flow cytometry, ELISPOT, western blot analysis, and ELISA. No single method of analysis meets the criteria for a comprehensive, biologically relevant assessment of the chemokines, therefore more than one assay might be necessary for correct data interpretation, a choice that is based on development of a scientific rationale for the method with emphasis on the reliability and relevance of the method.},

In this report, we characterise their appearance in the developing spleen and highlight their importance in relation to the development of splenic T cell zones. LTi cells were detected in embryonic spleen from embryonic day 13, although their progenitors were present at embryonic day 12. These cells clustered initially around splenic blood vessels in a lymphotoxin (LT)-independent manner, but up-regulation of VCAM-1 expression on stromal cells associated with the blood vessels was LT dependent. After birth, T cell colonisation of these clusters to form nascent white pulp areas was also LT dependent. Transfer experiments reconstituting RAG(-/-) mice with either WT or LTalpha(-/-) splenocytes demonstrated that lymphocyte expression of LT was not essential for the organisation of a discrete CD3(+) T cell zone with localised podoplanin and CCL21 expression. Our studies indicate that a combination of LT signals from LTi cells and LT-independent signals from lymphocytes is sufficient for expression of podoplanin and CCL21 on splenic T cell zone stroma and subsequent T cell organisation.},

abstract = {The molecular and cellular events that initiate the formation of T and B cell areas in developing lymph nodes are poorly understood. In this study we show that formation of the lymphoid architecture in murine neonatal lymph nodes evolves through a series of distinct stages. The initial segregation of T and B cells is regulated in a CXCL13-independent manner, characterized by the localization of B cells in a ring-like pattern in the outer cortex on day 4. However, during this CXCL13-independent phase of lymph node modeling, CXCL13 is expressed and regulated in a lymphotoxin-alpha1beta2 (LTalpha1beta2)-dependent manner. Surprisingly, neonatal B cells are unable to respond to this chemokine and also lack surface LTalpha1beta2 expression. At this time, CD45+CD4+CD3- cells are the predominant LTalpha1beta2-expressing cells and are also capable of responding to CXCL13. From day 4 on, architectural changes become CXCL13 dependent, and B cells become fully CXCL13 responsive, express LTalpha1beta2, and cluster in anatomically distinct follicles. Because the initial induction of CXCL13 is dependent on LTalpha1beta2, a role for CD45+CD4+CD3- cells in inducing chemokine expression in the developing lymph nodes is proposed and, as such, a role in initiation of the shaping of the microenvironment.},

@article{Celada1996,
abstract = {By experimenting with a cellular automaton model of the immune system, we have reproduced affinity maturation of the antibody response, a somatic adaptation to a changing environment. The simulation allowed the isolation of a number of variables, e.g. the fraction of repertoire available, the magnitude of the change in affinity with mutation, the mutation frequency and its focus on the complementarity-determining regions (CDR) of the antibody. Multiple series of immunizations were run in machina where the contribution of each variable was evaluated against the maturation observed. We found that hypermutation is not necessary for affinity maturation if the repertoire of B cell specificities is sufficiently complete, but is essential when the B cell diversity is limited (which happens to be the case in vivo), as it fills the holes in the repertoire and allows selection by antigen. Maturation also depends on the magnitude of the change in affinity with mutation, and we supply some necessary limits on this parameter. For mutations confined to the CDR, the most efficient maturation occurs at mutation rates of 0.2 per paratope and per cell division. When mutations also affect the framework regions, the peak of the most effective CDR mutation rate moves progressively to lower values. A most sensitive parameter is the speed of maturation, which reflects the rate of expansion of mutated clones. Comparing it with biological observations can help to discriminate between alternative hypotheses on the phenomena of hypermutation and affinity.},

abstract = {A computational methodology based on Metropolis Monte Carlo (MC) and the weighted histogram analysis method (WHAM) has been developed to calculate the absolute binding free energy between functionalized nanocarriers (NC) and endothelial cell (EC) surfaces. The calculated NC binding free energy landscapes yield binding affinities that agree quantitatively when directly compared against analogous measurements of specific antibody-coated NCs (100 nm in diameter) to intracellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) expressing EC surface in in vitro cell-culture experiments. The effect of antibody surface coverage ($\sigma$(s)) of NC on binding simulations reveals a threshold $\sigma$(s) value below which the NC binding affinities reduce drastically and drop lower than that of single anti-ICAM-1 molecule to ICAM-1. The model suggests that the dominant effect of changing $\sigma$(s) around the threshold is through a change in multivalent interactions; however, the loss in translational and rotational entropies are also important. Consideration of shear flow and glycocalyx does not alter the computed threshold of antibody surface coverage. The computed trend describing the effect of $\sigma$(s) on NC binding agrees remarkably well with experimental results of in vivo targeting of the anti-ICAM-1 coated NCs to pulmonary endothelium in mice. Model results are further validated through close agreement between computed NC rupture-force distribution and measured values in atomic force microscopy (AFM) experiments. The three-way quantitative agreement with AFM, in vitro (cell-culture), and in vivo experiments establishes the mechanical, thermodynamic, and physiological consistency of our model. Hence, our computational protocol represents a quantitative and predictive approach for model-driven design and optimization of functionalized nanocarriers in targeted vascular drug delivery.},

abstract = {The induction of interferon beta (IFNB1) is a key event in the antiviral immune response. We studied the role of transcriptional noise in the regulation of the IFNB1 locus in primary cultures of human dendritic cells (DCs), which are important 'first responders' to viral infection. In single cell assays, IFNB1 mRNA expression in virus-infected DCs showed much greater cell-to-cell variation than that of a housekeeping gene, another induced transcript and viral RNA. We determined the contribution of intrinsic noise by measuring the allelic origin of transcripts in each cell and found that intrinsic noise is a very significant part of total noise. We developed a stochastic model to investigate the underlying mechanisms. We propose that the surprisingly high levels of IFNB1 transcript noise originate from the complexity of IFNB1 enhanceosome formation, which leads to a range up to many minutes in the differences within each cell in the time of activation of each allele.},

abstract = {The secondary lymphoid tissues are located at strategic sites where foreign antigens can be efficiently brought together with immune system regulatory and effector cells. The organized structure of the secondary lymphoid tissues is thought to enhance the sensitivity of antigen recognition and to support proper regulation of the activation and maturation of the antigen-responsive lymphoid cells. Although a substantial amount is known about the cellular elements that compose the lymphoid and nonlymphoid components of the secondary lymphoid tissues, information concerning the signals that control the development of the tissues and that maintain the organized tissue microenvironment remain undefined. Studies over the past few years have identified lymphotoxin as a critical signaling molecule not only for the organogenesis of secondary lymphoid tissues but for the maintenance of aspects of their microarchitecture as well. Additional signaling molecules that contribute to the formation of normal lymphoid tissue structure are being identified at an accelerating pace. Analyses of mouse strains with congenital defects in different aspects of secondary lymphoid tissue development are beginning to clarify the role of these tissues in immune responses and host defense. This review focuses on studies defining recently identified crucial signals for the biogenesis of secondary lymphoid organs and for the maintenance of their proper microarchitecture. It also discusses new insights into how the structure of these tissues supports effective immune responses.},

Main Points:
- Computer simulations often criticised for not being reliable due to hidden flaws
- Structured argumentation techniques should be used in development and validation process of simulation-driven research
- Take a leaf out of Safety Critical Systems (SCS) work where system is operational only after requirements are accepted
- "Argumentation should be used not only post modelling and simulating, but before and during these activities"
        
Three Parts:
- CLAIMS for a particular product
- REASONING used to solve them
- EVIDENCE these are based on
        
"Argumentation pulls together all relevant pieces of information, combining them into a data-rich, tree-like structure that is both visually expressive, semantically enhanced and easier to use"
        
Goes through each of the parts of the diagram - ROOT, GOAL, SOLUTION, etc
        
Relevant: "claims about the biology of natural systems may not be properly supported by the computational or mathematical means that were employed"
        
Example in Reference 13 (Ghetiu 2009)
        
"Finally, after all the challenges have been addressed and the argument has been extended in order to accommodate necessary changes, it can be said that the initial claim is backed by a stronger argument, or that it has been invalidated"
        
Also goes through weaknesses:
- "Finally the syntax itself may need enhancements: GSN doesn't allow contextual elements such as assumptions or justifications to be broken down into sub-elements, as in the case of goals"},

While this technique has been widely used in the ecological and social sciences, it has only recently been applied in biomedical research. The purpose of this review is to provide an introduction to ABM as it has been used to study complex multi-cell biological phenomena, underscore the importance of coupling models with experimental work, and outline future challenges for the ABM field and its application to biomedical research. We highlight a number of published examples of ABM, focusing on work that has combined experimental with ABM analyses and how this pairing produces new understanding. We conclude with suggestions for moving forward with this parallel approach.},

abstract = {New molecular markers are constantly increasing our knowledge of developmental processes. In this review article we have attempted to summarize the keystones of lymphoid tissue development in embryonic and pathological conditions. During embryonic lymph node development in the mouse, cells from the anterior cardinal vein start to bud and sprout, forming a lymph sac at defined sites. The protrusion of mesenchymal tissue into the lymph sacs forms the environment, where so-called 'lymphoid tissue inducer cells' and 'mesenchymal organizer cells' meet and interact. Defects of molecules involved in the recruitment and signalling cascades of these cells lead to primary immunodeficiency diseases. A comparison of molecules involved in the development of secondary lymphoid organs and tertiary lymphoid organs, e.g. in autoimmune diseases, shows that the same molecules are involved in both processes. This has led to the hypothesis that the development of tertiary lymphoid organs is a recapitulation of embryonic lymphoid tissue development at ectopic sites.},

abstract = {The human microbiome plays a key role in human health and is associated with numerous diseases. Metagenomic-based studies are now generating valuable information about the composition of the microbiome in health and in disease, demonstrating nonneutral assembly processes and complex co-occurrence patterns. However, the underlying ecological forces that structure the microbiome are still unclear. Specifically, compositional studies alone with no information about mechanisms of interaction, potential competition, or syntrophy, cannot clearly distinguish habitat-filtering and species assortment assembly processes. To address this challenge, we introduce a computational framework, integrating metagenomic-based compositional data with genome-scale metabolic modeling of species interaction. We use in silico metabolic network models to predict levels of competition and complementarity among 154 microbiome species and compare predicted interaction measures to species co-occurrence. Applying this approach to two large-scale datasets describing the composition of the gut microbiome, we find that species tend to co-occur across individuals more frequently with species with which they strongly compete, suggesting that microbiome assembly is dominated by habitat filtering. Moreover, species' partners and excluders exhibit distinct metabolic interaction levels. Importantly, we show that these trends cannot be explained by phylogeny alone and hold across multiple taxonomic levels. Interestingly, controlling for host health does not change the observed patterns, indicating that the axes along which species are filtered are not fully defined by macroecological host states. The approach presented here lays the foundation for a reverse-ecology framework for addressing key questions concerning the assembly of host-associated communities and for informing clinical efforts to manipulate the microbiome.},

Because immune responses often begin with small numbers of cells and there is great variation among individual immune systems, we have chosen to implement a stochastic model that captures the life cycle of T cells more faithfully than deterministic models. Past models of the immune response have been differential equation based, which do not capture stochastic effects, or agent-based, which are computationally expensive. We use a stochastic stage-structured approach that has many of the advantages of agent-based modeling but is much more efficient. Our model can provide insights into the effect infections have on the CTL repertoire and the response to subsequent infections.},

abstract = {T lymphocytes (T cells) express T-cell receptor (TCR) molecules on their surface that can recognize peptides (p) derived from antigenic proteins bound to products of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) genes. The pMHC molecules are expressed on the surface of antigen-presenting cells, such as dendritic cells (DCs). T cells first encounter antigen on DCs in lymph nodes (LN). Intravital microscopy experiments show that upon entering the LN containing antigen, CD8+ T cells first move rapidly. After a few hours, they stop and make extended contacts with DCs. The factors that determine when and how this transition occurs are not well understood. We report results from computer simulations that suggest that the duration of phase one is related to the low probability of productive interactions between T cells and DCs. This is demonstrated by our finding that the antigen dose and type determine when such a transition occurs. These results are in agreement with experimental observations. TCR-pMHC binding characteristics and the antigen dose determine the time required for a productive T-cell-DC encounter (resulting in sustained contact). We find that the ratio of this time scale and the half-life of the pMHC complex itself provide a consolidated measure of antigen quantity and type. Results obtained upon varying different measures of antigen quantity and type fall on one curve when graphed against this ratio of time scales. Thus, we provide a mechanism for how the effects of varying one set of parameters are influenced by other prevailing conditions. This understanding should help guide future experimentation.},

abstract = {Computational models of cells, tissues and organisms are necessary for increased understanding of biological systems. In particular, modeling approaches will be crucial for moving biology from a descriptive to a predictive science. Pharmaceutical companies identify molecular interventions that they predict will lead to therapies at the organism level, suggesting that computational biology can play a key role in the pharmaceutical industry. We discuss pharmaceutically-relevant computational modeling approaches currently used as predictive tools. Specific examples demonstrate how companies can employ these computational models to improve the efficiency of transforming targets into therapies.},

abstract = {In microorganisms, noise in gene expression gives rise to cell-to-cell variability in protein concentrations. In mammalian cells, protein levels also vary and individual cells differ widely in their responsiveness to uniform physiological stimuli. In the case of apoptosis mediated by TRAIL (tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-related apoptosis-inducing ligand) it is common for some cells in a clonal population to die while others survive-a striking divergence in cell fate. Among cells that die, the time between TRAIL exposure and caspase activation is highly variable. Here we image sister cells expressing reporters of caspase activation and mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization after exposure to TRAIL. We show that naturally occurring differences in the levels or states of proteins regulating receptor-mediated apoptosis are the primary causes of cell-to-cell variability in the timing and probability of death in human cell lines. Protein state is transmitted from mother to daughter, giving rise to transient heritability in fate, but protein synthesis promotes rapid divergence so that sister cells soon become no more similar to each other than pairs of cells chosen at random. Our results have implications for understanding 'fractional killing' of tumour cells after exposure to chemotherapy, and for variability in mammalian signal transduction in general.},

@article{Segovia-Juarez2004,
abstract = {Infection with Mycobacterium tuberculosis is a major world health problem. An estimated 2 billion people are presently infected and the disease causes approximately 3 million deaths per year. After bacteria are inhaled into the lung, a complex immune response is triggered leading to the formation of multicellular structures termed granulomas. It is believed that the collection of host granulomas either contain bacteria resulting in a latent infection or are unable to do so, leading to active disease. Thus, understanding granuloma formation and function is essential for improving both diagnosis and treatment of tuberculosis. Granuloma formation is a complex spatio-temporal system involving interactions of bacteria, specific immune cells, including macrophages, CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, as well as immune effectors such as chemokine and cytokines. To study this complex dynamical system we have developed an agent-based model of granuloma formation in the lung. This model combines continuous representations of chemokines with discrete agent representations of macrophages and T cells in a cellular automata-like environment. Our results indicate that key host elements involved in granuloma formation are chemokine diffusion, prevention of macrophage overcrowding within the granuloma, arrival time, location and number of T cells within the granuloma, and an overall host ability to activate macrophages. Interestingly, a key bacterial factor is its intracellular growth rate, whereby slow growth actually facilitates survival.},

abstract = {Lymphoid follicles are B-cell-rich compartments of lymphoid organs that function as sites of B-cell antigen encounter and differentiation. CXC chemokine receptor-5 (CXCR5) is required for B-cell migration to splenic follicles, but the requirements for homing to B-cell areas in lymph nodes remain to be defined. Here we show that lymph nodes contain two types of B-cell-rich compartment: follicles containing follicular dendritic cells, and areas lacking such cells. Using gene-targeted mice, we establish that B-lymphocyte chemoattractant (BLC/BCA1) and its receptor, CXCR5, are needed for B-cell homing to follicles in lymph nodes as well as in spleen. We also find that BLC is required for the development of most lymph nodes and Peyer's patches. In addition to mediating chemoattraction, BLC induces B cells to up-regulate membrane lymphotoxin alpha1beta2, a cytokine that promotes follicular dendritic cell development and BLC expression, establishing a positive feedback loop that is likely to be important in follicle development and homeostasis. In germinal centres the feedback loop is overridden, with B-cell lymphotoxin alpha1beta2 expression being induced by a mechanism independent of BLC.},

The cost of such simulation is significantly reduced compared to that of in vivo simulation. However, the inherent complexity of biological system makes it hard to simulate these systems on non-parallel architectures: models might be made of sub-models and take several scales into account; the number of simulated entities may be quite large. Today, graphics cards are used for general purpose computing which has been made easier thanks to frameworks like CUDA or OpenCL. Parallelization of models may however not be easy: parallel computer programing skills are often required; several hardware architectures may be used to execute models. In this paper, we present the software architecture we built in order to implement various models able to simulate multi-cellular system. This architecture is modular and it implements data structures adapted for graphics processing units architectures. It allows efficient simulation of biological mechanisms.},

abstract = {Recently, two-photon imaging has allowed intravital tracking of lymphocyte migration and cellular interactions during germinal center (GC) reactions. The implications of two-photon measurements obtained by several investigators are currently the subject of controversy. With the help of two mathematical approaches, we reanalyze these data. It is shown that the measured lymphocyte migration frequency between the dark and the light zone is quantitatively explained by persistent random walk of lymphocytes. The cell motility data imply a fast intermixture of cells within the whole GC in approximately 3 h, and this does not allow for maintenance of dark and light zones. The model predicts that chemotaxis is active in GCs to maintain GC zoning and demonstrates that chemotaxis is consistent with two-photon lymphocyte motility data. However, the model also predicts that the chemokine sensitivity is quickly down-regulated. On the basis of these findings, we formulate a novel GC lymphocyte migration model and propose its verification by new two-photon experiments that combine the measurement of B cell migration with that of specific chemokine receptor expression levels. In addition, we discuss some statistical limitations for the interpretation of two-photon cell motility measurements in general.},

abstract = {Secondary lymphoid organs are important locations for the initiation of adaptive immune responses. They develop before birth, and their formation requires interaction between lymphotoxin-alpha(1)beta(2)-expressing lymphoid-tissue inducer cells and lymphotoxin-beta receptor-expressing stromal organizer cells. Here, we discuss new insights into the earliest phases of peripheral lymph node and Peyer's patch formation that occur before lymphotoxin-beta receptor signalling and suggest a role for the developing nervous system. In addition, we discuss the differing requirements for the postnatal formation of mucosa-associated lymphoid tissues and tertiary lymphoid structures that develop at sites of chronic inflammation.},

Key Paper in the Process
        
Main Points:
- Good definitions of what secondary lymphoid organs are
- Potential role of the nervous system
        
LYMPH NODES:
- First step (clustering) can occur without LTalpha/beta signalling (king of going against Yoshida paper?)
- No lymph nodes form in absence of CXCL13/CCR5, and no LTi clustering
- Fibres near developing lymph nodes express RALDH2, which generates Retinolic acid, and therefore could dictate the location where these form (though not confirmed)
- Motor neurons could also be source of retinolic acid and this dictates the location these form
        
- IL-7 \& TRANCE (RANKL) lead to induced LTalpha/beta expression by LTi cells
- LTI cells express TRANCE and TRANCER (RANK) and signalling induced through the TRANCE receptor (RANK) is required for lymph node formation as this leads to LTalpha/beta expression
- Stromal cell LTbetaR signalling induces TRANCE and IL-7 expression, leading to further LTalpha/beta expression by LTi cells
        
PEYERS PATCHES
- Evenly distributed at E15.5
- RET signalling initiates process, but RET is only expressed by LTin cells (which have no role in LN formation)
- LTin cells initiate the process as these express a higher level of LTbeta than LTi cells
- IL-7 produced by stromal cells leads to LTalpha/beta expression by LTi cells
- So RET is important in PP, but TRANCE/RANK in LN
