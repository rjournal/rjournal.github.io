title: Applying spartan to Understand Parameter Uncertainty in Simulations
abstract: 'In attempts to further understand the dynamics of complex systems, the
  application of computer simulation is becoming increasingly prevalent. Whereas a
  great deal of focus has been placed in the development of software tools that aid
  researchers develop simulations, similar focus has not been applied in the creation
  of tools that perform a rigorous statistical analysis of results generated through
  simulation: vital in understanding how these results offer an insight into the captured
  system. This encouraged us to develop spartan, a package of statistical techniques
  designed to assist researchers in understanding the relationship between their simulation
  and the real system. Previously we have described each technique within spartan
  in detail, with an accompanying immunology case study examining the development
  of lymphoid tissue. Here we provide a practical introduction to the package, demonstrating
  how each technique is run in R, to assist researchers in integrating this package
  alongside their chosen simulation platform.'
