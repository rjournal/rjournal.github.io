title: Manipulation of Discrete Random Variables with discreteRV
abstract: A prominent issue in statistics education is the sometimes large disparity
  between the theoretical and the computational coursework. discreteRV is an R package
  for manipulation of discrete random variables which uses clean and familiar syntax
  similar to the mathematical notation in introductory probability courses. The package
  offers functions that are simple enough for users with little experience with statistical
  programming, but has more advanced features which are suitable for a large number
  of more complex applications. In this paper, we introduce and motivate discreteRV,
  describe its functionality, and provide reproducible examples illustrating its use.
