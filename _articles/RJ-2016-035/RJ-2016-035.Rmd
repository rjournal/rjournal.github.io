title: 'eiCompare: Comparing Ecological Inference Estimates across EI and EI:RxC'
abstract: 'Social scientists and statisticians often use aggregate data to predict
  individual-level behavior because the latter are not always available. Various statistical
  techniques have been developed to make inferences from one level (e.g., precinct)
  to another level (e.g., individual voter) that minimize errors associated with ecological
  inference. While ecological inference has been shown to be highly problematic in
  a wide array of scientific fields, many political scientists and analysis employ
  the techniques when studying voting patterns. Indeed, federal voting rights lawsuits
  now require such an analysis, yet expert reports are not consistent in which type
  of ecological inference is used. This is especially the case in the analysis of
  racially polarized voting when there are multiple candidates and multiple racial
  groups. The *eiCompare* package was developed to easily assess two of the more common
  ecological inference methods: EI and EI:R$\times$C. The package facilitates a seamless
  comparison between these methods so that scholars and legal practitioners can easily
  assess the two methods and whether they produce similar or disparate findings.'

# Introduction

Ecological inference is a widely debated methodology for attempting to
understand individual, or micro behavior from aggregate data. Ecological
inference has come under fire for being unreliable, especially in the
fields of biological sciences, ecology, epidemiology, public health and
many social sciences. For example, @freedman1999ecological explains that
when confronted with individual level data, many ecological aggregate
estimates in epidemiology have been proven to be wrong. In the field of
ecology @martin2005zero expose the problem of zero-inflation in studies
of the presence or absence of specific species of different animals and
note that ecological techniques can lead to incorrect inference.
@greenland2001ecologic describes the many pitfalls of ecological
inference in public health due to the nonrandomization of social context
across ecological units of analysis. Elsewhere, @greenland1994invited
have argued that the problem of ecological confounder control leads to
biased estimates of risk in epidemiology. Related, @frair2010resolving
argue that while some ecological analysis can be informative when
studying animal habitat preference, existing methods of ecological
inference provide imprecise information on variation in the outcome
variables and that considerable improvements are necessary.
@wakefield2004ecological provides a nice comparison of how ecological
inference performs across epidemiological versus social scientific
research. He concludes that in epidemiological applications
individual-level data are required for consistently accurate statistical
inference.

However, within the narrow subfield of racial voting patterns in
American elections ecological inference is regularly used. This is
especially common in scholarly research on the voting rights act where
the United States Supreme Courts directly recommended ecological
inference analysis as the main statistical method to estimate voting
preference by racial group (e.g. *Thornburg v. Gingles 478 U.S. 30,
1986*). Because Courts in the U.S. have so heavily relied on ecological
inference, it has gained prominence in political science research. The
American Constitution Society for Law and Policy explains that
ecological inference is one of the three statistical analyses that must
be performed in voting rights research on racial voting patterns.[^1] As
ecological inference evolved a group of scholars developed the *eiPack*
package and published an article in *R News* announcing the new package
[@lau2006eipack].

This article does not conclude that ecological inference is appropriate
or reliable outside the specific domain of American elections. Indeed,
scholars in the fields of epidemiology and public health have correctly
pointed out the limitations of individual level inference from aggregate
date. However, its application to voting data in the United States
represents one area where it may have utility, if model assumptions are
met [@tam2004limits]. Indeed, the main point of our article is not to
settle the debate on the accuracy of ecological inference in the
sciences writ large, but rather to assess the degree of similarity or
difference with respect to two heavily used R packages within the field
of political science, [*ei*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=ei) and
[*eiPack*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=eiPack). Our package,
[*eiCompare*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=eiCompare) offers
scholars who regularly use ecological inference in analyses of voting
patterns the ability to easily compare, contrast and diagnose estimates
across two different ecological methods that are recommended statistical
techniques in voting rights litigation.

Today, although there is continued debate among social scientists
[@greiner2007ecological; @greiner2011quantitative; @cho1998iff] --- the
courts generally rely on two statistical approaches to ecological data.
The first, ecological inference (EI), developed by @king1997solution, is
said to be preferred when there are only two racial or ethnic groups,
and ideally only two candidates contesting office. However,
@wakefield2004ecological notes that EI methods can be improved with the
use of survey data as Bayesian priors. The second, ecological inference
R$\times$C (R$\times$C) developed by @rosen2001bayesian, is said to be
preferred when there are multiple racial or ethnic groups, or multiple
candidates contesting office. However, it is not clear that when faced
with the exact same dataset, they would produce different results. In
one case, analysis of the same dataset across multiple ecological
approaches found they tend to produce the same conclusion
[@grofman2009reply]. However, others have argued that using King's EI
iterative approach with multiple racial groups or multiple candidates
will fail and should not be relied on [@ferree2004iterative]. Still
others have gone further and stated that EI cannot be used to analyze
multiple racial group or multiple candidate elections, stating that "it
biases the analysis for finding racially polarized voting," going on to
call this approach "problematic" and stating that "no valid statistical
inferences can be drawn" [@katz_14].

As with any methodological advancement, there is a healthy and rigorous
debate in the literature. However, very little real election data has
been brought to bear in this debate. @ferree2004iterative offers a
simulation of Black, White, and Latino turnout and voting patterns, and
then examines real data from a parliamentary election in South Africa
using a proportional representation system. [@grofman2009reply] compare
an exit poll to precinct election data in Los Angeles, but only compare
Goodman's ecological regression against King's EI, using the
single-equation versus double-equation approach, and do not examine the
R$\times$C approach at all.

# Debates over ecological inference

The challenges surrounding ecological inference are well documented.
@robinson2009ecological pointed out that relying on aggregate data to
infer the behavior of individuals can result in the ecological fallacy,
and since then scholars have applied different methods to discern more
accurately individual correlations from aggregate data.
@goodman1953ecological [@goodman1959some] advanced the idea of
ecological regression where individual patterns can be drawn from
ecological data under certain conditions. However Goodman's logic
assumed that group patterns were consistent across each ecological unit,
and in reality that may not be the case.

Eventually, systematic analysis revealed that these early methods could
be unreliable [@king1997solution]. Ecological inference is King's (1997)
solution to the ecological fallacy problem inherent in aggregate data,
and since the late 1990s has been the benchmark method courts use in
evaluating racial polarization in voting rights lawsuits, and has been
used widely in comparative politics research on group and ethnic voting
patterns. Critics claim that King's EI model was designed primarily for
situations with just two groups (e.g., blacks and whites; Hispanics and
Anglos, etc.). While many geographic areas (e.g., Mississippi, Alabama)
still contain essentially two groups and hence pose no threat to
traditional EI estimation procedures, the growth of racial groups such
as Latinos and Asians have challenged the historical biracial focus on
race in the United States (thereby challenging traditional EI model
assumptions). @rosen2001bayesian suggest a rows by columns (R$\times$C)
approach which allows for multiple racial groups, and multiple
candidates; however, their Bayesian approach suffered computational
difficulties and was not employed at a mass level. Since then, computing
power has steadily improved, making R$\times$C a realistic solution for
many scenarios and accessible packages now exist in R that are widely
used. These two methodological approaches are now both regularly used in
political science; however, there is no consistent evidence how they
perform side-by-side, and are different.

@ferree2004iterative critiques King's EI model, arguing that the
conditions for iterative estimation (e.g., black vs. non black, white
vs. non-white, Hispanic vs. non-Hispanic) can be considerably biased due
to aggregation bias and multimodality in the data. In a hypothetical
simulation dataset, Ferree shows that combining blacks and whites into a
single "non-Hispanic" group in order to estimate Hispanic turnout can
vastly overestimate Hispanic turnout, for example. However, the analysis
did not provide any clues as to the specific conditions when and how
R$\times$C is significantly better or preferred to EI. For example, if
there are three racial groups in equal thirds of the electorate, does
aggregation bias create more error in EI than a scenario in which two
dominant groups comprise 90% and a small group is just 10%? Likewise, is
EI's iterative approach to candidates more stable when analyzing three
candidates and far less stable when eight candidates contest the
election? These questions have not been considered empirically. Instead,
the existing scholarship uses simulation data to prove theoretically
that EI might create bias and that R$\times$C is preferred. We argue
that real election data should be considered in a side-by-side
comparison.

Despite some critiques, other political scientists have defended
ecological inference and even ecological regression using both
simulations and real data. @owen1997estimating assess whether or not
ecological fallacy in ecological regression is a theoretical problem
only, a real problem for empirical analysis. In an extensive review,
Owen and Grofman conclude that despite the valid theoretical concerns,
linear ecological regression still holds up and provides meaningful and
accurate estimates of racially polarized voting. A decade later,
@grofman2009reply again take up the question of how ecological models
compare to one another using a combination of simulation, actual
election precinct data, and an accompanying individual-level exit poll.
Their analysis argues that there is general consistency across all
ecological models and that once voter turnout rates are accounted for,
ecological regression and King's EI lead scholars to the same results.
However, Grofman and Barreto did not consider R$\times$C in their
comparison.

@greiner2010exit combine R$\times$C methods with individual level exit
poll data, and argue that this hybrid model can be preferable to a
straight aggregation model. However, using exit poll data is not always
available to all researchers and practitioners. Indeed, in most county
or city elections, exit poll data does not exist which is why scholars
often attempt to infer voting patterns through aggregate data.
@herron2003using also criticize EI estimates when used for second-stage
regression - given that error is baked into the second-level regression
estimation. However @adolph2003analyzing respond by adjusting the EI
procedure to reduce inconsistencies when estimating second-stage
regressions. Nevertheless, these issues with EI do not speak
specifically to R$\times$C methods.

@james2009r extend the 2$\times$`<!-- -->`{=html}2 EI contingency
problem to 3$\times$`<!-- -->`{=html}3 and estimate voting preferences
simultaneously for three candidates across three racial groups (but
using counts instead of percentages). We extend this work by analyzing
real-world datasets with sizes greater than 3$\times$`<!-- -->`{=html}3
(multiple candidates and at least three racial groups). In all of this,
our main goal is to assess whether using iterative EI or simultaneous
R$\times$C approaches change the conclusions social scientists can make
from the data.

Finally, some have gone even further in arguing that EI is ill-equipped
to handle complex datasets with multiple candidates and multiple racial
groups, and that only R$\times$C can produce reliable results
[@katz_14]. In explaining the theoretical reasons why EI cannot
accurately process such elections Katz argues "adding additional groups
and vote choices to King's (1997) EI is not straightforward," and also
adds "given the estimation uncertainty, it may not be possible to infer
which candidate is preferred by members of the group." The argument
against EI in multiple racial group, or especially multiple candidate
elections is that EI takes an iterative approach pitting candidate A
versus all others who are not candidate A. If the election features four
candidates (A, B, C, D) critics state that you cannot accurately
estimate vote choice quantities if you compare the vote for candidate A
against the combined vote for B, C, D. The iterative approach would then
move on to estimate the vote share for candidate B against the combined
vote for A, C, D and so on, so that four separate equations are run.
@katz_14 claims that EI biases the findings in favor of bloc-voting
stating "this jerry rigged approach to dealing with more than two vote
choices stacks the deck in favor of finding statistical evidence for
racially polarized." Given these debates, our package allows scholars to
quite easily make side-by-side comparisons and evaluate these competing
claims.

While important advancements have been made in ecological inference
techniques by @king1997solution and @rosen2001bayesian there is no
consistency in which technique is used and how results are presented.
What's more, legal experts and social scientists often argue during
voting rights lawsuits that one technique is superior to the other, or
that their results are more accurate. There is no question that both
social scientists and legal experts would greatly benefit from a
standardized software package that presents both ecological inference
results (EI and R$\times$C) simultaneously and metrics to compare each
set of results. Thus, *eiCompare* was designed to compare the most
commonly used methods today, EI and R$\times$C, but also incorporates
Goodman methods. The package lets analysts seamlessly assess whether EI
and R$\times$C estimates are similar (see @king1997solution and
@rosen2001bayesian for a methodological description of the techniques).
It incorporates functions from *ei* [@ei_cite] and *eiPack*
[@eipack_cite] into a new package that relatively quickly compares
ecological inference estimates across the two routines.

The package includes several functions that ultimately produce tables of
results from the different ecological inference methods. Thus, in the
case of racially polarized voting, analysts can quickly assess whether
different racial groups preferred different candidates, according to the
EI, R$\times$C, and Goodman approaches. The *eiCompare* package wraps
the `ei()` procedure [@king2012ei] into a generalized function, has a
variety of table-making functions, and a plotting method that
graphically depicts the difference between estimates for the two main EI
methods (EI and R$\times$C). Below, we use a working example of a voter
precinct dataset in Corona, CA. To use the package, the process is
simple: 1) Load the package, the appropriate data, run the EI
generalized function, and create an EI table of results, 2) Run the
R$\times$C function (from *eiPack*) and create a table of results, 3)
Run the Goodman regression generalized function if the user chooses, 4)
Combine the results of all the algorithms together into a comparison
table, and 5) Plot the comparison results. Before we conclude, we also
compare EI and R$\times$C findings against exit poll data from a 2005
Los Angeles mayoral run-off election. The rest of the paper follows this
aforementioned outline.

# EI generalize

To begin, we install (`install.packages("eiCompare")`) and load the
*eiCompare* package (`library(eiCompare)`) from the CRAN repository.
First, we load the aggregate-level dataset (`data(cor_06)`) into R, in
this case a precinct (voting district) dataset from a 2006 election in
the city of Corona, CA. Table [1](#corona) below displays the first five
rows and column headers of the dataset. This dataset includes all the
necessary variables to run the code in the `eiCompare` package. The
first column is `"precinct"`, which essentially operates as a unique
identifier. The second column, `"totvote"`, is the total number of votes
cast within the precinct. Columns three and four are the two racial
groups of whom we seek to determine their mean voting preference. The
rest of the columns are the percent of the total vote for each
respective candidate.

  column, racial/ethnic percentages of people living in the precinct,
  and vote percent for each candidate.
:::

We are interested in how the four candidates (Breitenbucher, Montanez,
Spiegel, Skipworth) performed with Latino voters and non-Latino voters
(mostly non-Hispanic white), so we can asses whether racially polarized
voting exists. The process begins with the `ei_est_gen()` function,
which is a generalized version of the `ei()` function from the *ei*
package. Instead of having to estimate EI results for each candidate and
each racial group separately, `ei_est_gen()` automates this process.

The `ei_est_gen()` function takes a vector of candidate names, a
character vector of tilde-prefixed racial group names, the name of the
column representing the total number of people in the jurisdiction
(e.g., registered voters, ballots cast), the `"data.frame"` object
holding the data, and the table names used to display the results. The
function also has four optional arguments, `rho`, `sample`, `tomog`, and
`density_plot`. The former two can be used to adjust the parameters of
the `ei()` algorithm. These are especially useful when the initial run
does not compile or warnings are produced. The latter two plot out
tomography and density plots, respectively, into the working directory
but are set to off by default. These plots can be used to assess the
stability -- and thus veracity -- of the EI procedure (see @king2012ei
and [@king1997solution] for details). Finally, the `...` argument passes
additional arguments onto the `ei()` function from the *ei* package.

One final note, given its iterative nature, the `ei_est_gen()` function
can take a while to execute. This typically depends on features unique
to the dataset, including the number of candidates and groups, the
amount of racial/ethnic segregation within the city/area, as well as the
number of precincts. This particular example does not take especially
long, executing in about a minute on a standard Macbook Pro.

``` r
# LOAD DATA
data(cor_06)
# SET SEED FOR REPRODUCIBILITY
set.seed(294271) 
# CREATE CHARACTER VECTORS REQUIRED FOR FUNCTION
cands <- c("pct_breitenbucher","pct_montanez","pct_spiegel", "pct_skipworth")
race_group2 <- c("~ pct_latino", "~ pct_other")
table_names <- c("EI: Pct Lat", "EI: Pct Other")
# RUN EI GENERALIZED FUNCTION
results <- ei_est_gen(cand_vector=cands, race_group = race_group2,
                   total = "totvote", data = cor_06, table_names = table_names)
# LOOK AT TABLE OF RESULTS
results                     
```

The call to the results object produces a table of results indicating
the mean estimated voting preferences for Latinos and non-Latinos within
the city of Corona (see Table [2](#ei_results)). The results strongly
suggest the presence of racially polarized voting, as Latinos prefer
Montanez as their number one choice, whereas non-Latinos do not.

# EI: R$\times$C

The R$\times$C builds off of code from the *eiPack* package, where
*eiCompare* simply takes the former's results and puts them into a
similar `"data.frame"`/`"table"` object similar to the results from the
`ei_est_gen()` function. First, the user follows the code from the
*eiPack* package (here we use the `ei.reg.bayes()` function), and
creates a formula object including all candidates and all groups. The
user must ensure that the percentages on both signs of the $\sim$ symbol
add to 1. Thus, the initial `table()` code is a simple data check to
ensure that this rule is followed. The R$\times$C model is then run
using the `ei.reg.bayes()` model. Users can read the *eiPack*
documentation to familiarize themselves with this procedure. Depending
on the nature of one's data, the R$\times$C code can take a while to
run. Finally, the results are passed onto the `bayes_table_make()`
function, along with a vector of candidate names, and a vector of table
names, similar to what was passed to `ei_est_gen()`.

The results are presented in Table [3](#ei_rc_results), and look
remarkably similar to those presented in Table [2](#ei_results). Indeed,
the exact same conclusions would be drawn from an analysis of both
tables: Latinos prefer Montanez as their first choice and non-latinos
prefer Spiegel as their top choice.

# Goodman generalize

While many users will skip over the Goodman regression when conducting
ecological inference, given the documented issues with the method
[@shively1969ecological; @king1997solution], *eiCompare* nevertheless
has a Goodman regression generalized function, similar to the
`ei_est_gen()` function. This function takes a character vector of
candidate names, a character vector of racial groups, the name of the
column, a data object, and a character vector of table names. Because
Goodman is simply a linear regression, the execution is very fast.

``` r
table_names <- c("Good: Pct Lat", "Good: Pct Other")
good <- goodman_generalize(cands, race_group2, "totvote", cor_06, table_names)
good
```

Table [4](#good_results) shows the Goodman regression results. In this
particular case, these results align quite closely with results from the
two EI models. All three approaches essentially tell us the same thing.

# Combining results

The last two sections address the comparison component of the package.
The function, `ei_rc_good_table()`, takes the objects from the EI,
R$\times$C, and Goodman regression, and puts them into a
`"data.frame"``"table"` object. To simplify comparison, the table adds
an EI-R$\times$C column differential for each racial group. This format
lets the user quickly assess how the EI and R$\times$C methods stack up
against one another. The function takes the following arguments: EI
results object (e.g., `results`), an R$\times$C object (e.g.,
`ei_bayes_res`), and a character vector `groups` (e.g.,
`c("Latino", "Other")`) argument. The `good` argument for the Goodman
regression is set to `NULL`, and the `include_good` argument defaults to
`FALSE`. If the user wants to include a Goodman regression in the
comparison of results they need to change the latter to `TRUE` and
specify the the `good` argument as the object name from the
`goodman_generalize()` call.

  candidate vote preferences in Corona, 2006
:::

The results of `ei_rc_good_table()` is a new class `"ei_compare"`, which
includes a `"data.frame"` and groups character vector. This output is
ultimately passed to `plot()`.

``` r
ei_rc_combine <- ei_rc_good_table(results, ei_bayes_res,
                        groups = c("Latino", "Other"))
ei_rc_combine@data

ei_rc_g_combine <- ei_rc_good_table(results, ei_bayes_res, good,
                         groups = c("Latino", "Other"), include_good = TRUE)
ei_rc_g_combine
```

Table [5](#ei_rc_compare) displays the output of a call to the
`ei_rc_good_table()` function for the first line of code above. The user
must include the code `@data` onto the outputted table name to extract
just the table. This table basically summarizes the results of the EI
and R$\times$C analyses. Clearly, very little difference emerges between
the two methods in this particular instance.

# Plotting results

Finally, users can plot the results of the EI, and R$\times$C comparison
to more visually determine whether the two methods are similar. Plotting
is simple, as plot methods have been developed for the `"ei_compare"`
class. The code below produces the plot depicted in
Figure [1](#figure:plot_compare).

``` r
# PLOT COMPARISON -- adjust the axes labels slightly
plot(ei_rc_combine, cex.axis = .5, cex.lab = .7)
```

# Comparing ecological and individual-level data

One possible question remains, whether or not ecological estimates line
up with individual level estimates. Many studies have pointed out that
ecological fallacy and aggregation bias can produce ecological inference
results that are highly questionable. In this section we implement the
*eiCompare* package for a mayoral election in a multiethnic setting in
which an individual-level exit poll survey was also administered. The
*eiCompare* package provides EI and R$\times$C results for the 2005 Los
Angeles mayoral runoff election between Antonio Villaraigosa and James
Hahn, and we also add results for the Los Angeles Times exit poll.
Results are displayed in Table [6](#ei_rc_poll).

:::

The results presented in Table [6](#ei_rc_poll) demonstrate that not
only do EI and R$\times$C produce remarkably consistent results, but
they very closely match the individual level estimates for the Los
Angeles Times. The EI R$\times$C estimates are all with the confidence
range of the individual level data reported by the exit poll.

# Summary

*eiCompare* is a new package that builds on the work of King and others
that attempts to address the ecological inference problem of making
individual-level assessments based on aggregate-level data. As we have
reviewed above, there is considerable debate in the sciences about the
utility and accuracy of ecological techniques. Despite these well
documented questions, ecological inference is widely used in political
science and will continue to grow in importance when the
constitutionally mandated redistricting in 2021 occurs. The
redistricting cycle will bring with it extensive academic, legislative,
and legal research using ecological inference to assess racial voting
patterns across all 50 states.

While this new package does not develop a new method, *per se*, it
improves analysts' ability to quickly compare different commonly used EI
algorithms to assess the veracity of the methods and also produce tables
of their findings. While R$\times$C has been touted as the method
necessary in situations with multiple groups and multiple candidates,
the results do not always demonstrate face validity. In these scenarios
-- and others -- analysts may want to incorporate original EI methods so
they can compare how the two approaches stack up. Ultimately, this
approach provides a needed assessment between two commonly used methods
in voting behavior research.
