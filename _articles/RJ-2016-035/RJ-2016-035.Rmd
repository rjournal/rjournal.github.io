title: 'eiCompare: Comparing Ecological Inference Estimates across EI and EI:RC'
abstract: 'Social scientists and statisticians often use aggregate data to predict
  individual-level behavior because the latter are not always available. Various statistical
  techniques have been developed to make inferences from one level (e.g., precinct)
  to another level (e.g., individual voter) that minimize errors associated with ecological
  inference. While ecological inference has been shown to be highly problematic in
  a wide array of scientific fields, many political scientists and analysis employ
  the techniques when studying voting patterns. Indeed, federal voting rights lawsuits
  now require such an analysis, yet expert reports are not consistent in which type
  of ecological inference is used. This is especially the case in the analysis of
  racially polarized voting when there are multiple candidates and multiple racial
  groups. The eiCompare package was developed to easily assess two of the more common
  ecological inference methods: EI and EI:R×C. The package facilitates a seamless
  comparison between these methods so that scholars and legal practitioners can easily
  assess the two methods and whether they produce similar or disparate findings.'
