title: 'GsymPoint: An R Package to Estimate the Generalized Symmetry Point, an Optimal
  Cut-off Point for Binary Classification in Continuous Diagnostic Tests'
abstract: In clinical practice, it is very useful to select an optimal cutpoint in
  the scale of a continuous biomarker or diagnostic test for classifying individuals
  as healthy or diseased. Several methods for choosing optimal cutpoints have been
  presented in the literature, depending on the ultimate goal. One of these methods,
  the generalized symmetry point, recently introduced, generalizes the symmetry point
  by incorporating the misclassification costs. Two statistical approaches have been
  proposed in the literature for estimating this optimal cutpoint and its associated
  sensitivity and specificity measures, a parametric method based on the generalized
  pivotal quantity and a nonparametric method based on empirical likelihood. In this
  paper, we introduce GsymPoint, an R package that implements these methods in a user-friendly
  environment, allowing the end-user to calculate the generalized symmetry point depending
  on the levels of certain categorical covariates. The practical use of this package
  is illustrated using three real biomedical datasets.
