title: 'lba: An R Package for Latent Budget Analysis'
abstract: The latent budget model is a mixture model for compositional data sets in
  which the entries, a contingency table, may be either realizations from a product
  multinomial distribution or distribution free. Based on this model, the latent budget
  analysis considers the interactions of two variables; the ex planatory (row) and
  the response (column) variables. The package lba uses expectation-maximization and
  active constraints method (ACM) to carry out, respectively, the maximum likelihood
  and the least squares estimation of the model parameters. It contains three main
  functions, lba which performs the analysis, goodnessfit for model selection and
  goodness of fit and the plotting functions plotcorr and plotlba used as a help in
  the interpretation of the results.
