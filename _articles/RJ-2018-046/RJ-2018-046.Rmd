title: 'fICA: FastICA Algorithms and Their Improved Variants'
abstract: In independent component analysis (ICA) one searches for mutually independent
  non gaussian latent variables when the components of the multivariate data are assumed
  to be linear combinations of them. Arguably, the most popular method to perform
  ICA is FastICA. There are two classical versions, the deflation-based FastICA where
  the components are found one by one, and the symmetric FastICA where the components
  are found simultaneously. These methods have been implemented previously in two
  R packages, fastICA and ica. We present the R package fICA and compare it to the
  other packages. Additional features in fICA include optimization of the extraction
  order in the deflation-based version, possibility to use any nonlinearity function,
  and improvement to convergence of the deflation-based algorithm. The usage of the
  package is demonstrated by applying it to the real ECG data of a pregnant woman.
