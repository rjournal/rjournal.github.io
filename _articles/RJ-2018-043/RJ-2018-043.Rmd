title: 'nsROC: An R package for Non-Standard ROC Curve Analysis'
abstract: 'The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve is a graphical method
  which has become standard in the analysis of diagnostic markers, that is, in the
  study of the classification ability of a numerical variable. Most of the commercial
  statistical software provide routines for the standard ROC curve analysis. Of course,
  there are also many R packages dealing with the ROC estimation as well as other
  related problems. In this work we introduce the nsROC package which incorporates
  some new ROC curve procedures. Particularly: ROC curve comparison based on general
  distances among functions for both paired and unpaired designs; efficient confidence
  bands construction; a generalization of the curve considering different classification
  subsets than the one involved in the classical defini tion of the ROC curve; a procedure
  to deal with censored data in cumulative-dynamic ROC curve estimation for time-to-event
  outcomes; and a non-parametric ROC curve method for meta-analysis. This is the only
  R package which implements these particular procedures.'
