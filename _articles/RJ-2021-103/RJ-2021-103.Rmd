title: 'bssm: Bayesian Inference of Non-linear and Non-Gaussian State Space Models
  in R'
abstract: We present an R package bssm for Bayesian non-linear/non-Gaussian state
  space modeling. Unlike the existing packages, bssm allows for easy-to-use approximate
  inference based on Gaussian approximations such as the Laplace approximation and
  the extended Kalman filter. The package also accommodates discretely observed latent
  diffusion processes. The inference is based on fully automatic, adaptive Markov
  chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) on the hyperparameters, with optional importance sampling
  post-correction to eliminate any approximation bias. The package also implements
  a direct pseudo-marginal MCMC and a delayed acceptance pseudo-marginal MCMC using
  intermediate approximations. The package offers an easy-to-use interface to define
  models with linear-Gaussian state dynamics with non-Gaussian observation models
  and has an Rcpp interface for specifying custom non-linear and diffusion models.
