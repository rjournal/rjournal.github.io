title: 'Modeling regimes with extremes: the bayesdfa package for identifying and forecasting
  common trends and anomalies in multivariate time-series data'
abstract: The bayesdfa package provides a flexible Bayesian modeling framework for
  applying dy namic factor analysis (DFA) to multivariate time-series data as a dimension
  reduction tool. The core estimation is done with the Stan probabilistic programming
  language. In addition to being one of the few Bayesian implementations of DFA, novel
  features of this model include (1) optionally modeling latent process deviations
  as drawn from a Student-t distribution to better model extremes, and (2) optionally
  including autoregressive and moving-average components in the latent trends. Besides
  estimation, we provide a series of plotting functions to visualize trends, loadings,
  and model pre dicted values. A secondary analysis for some applications is to identify
  regimes in latent trends. We provide a flexible Bayesian implementation of a Hidden
  Markov Model — also written with Stan — to characterize regime shifts in latent
  processes. We provide simulation testing and details on parameter sensitivities
  in supplementary information.
