title: 'robslopes: Efficient Computation of the (Repeated) Median Slope'
abstract: ' Modern use of slope estimation often involves the (repeated) estimation
  of a large number of slopes on a large number of data points. Some of the most popular
  non-parametric and robust alternatives to the least squares estimator are the Theil-Sen
  and Siegel''s repeated median slope estimators. The [robslopes](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=robslopes)
  package contains fast algorithms for these slope estimators. The implemented randomized
  algorithms run in $\mathcal{O}(n\log(n))$ and $\mathcal{O}(n\log^2(n))$ expected
  time respectively and use $\mathcal{O}(n)$ space. They achieve speedups up to a
  factor $10^3$ compared with existing implementations for common sample sizes, as
  illustrated in a benchmark study, and they allow for the possibility of estimating
  the slopes on samples of size $10^5$ and larger thanks to the limited space usage.
  Finally, the original algorithms are adjusted in order to properly handle duplicate
  values in the data set. '
