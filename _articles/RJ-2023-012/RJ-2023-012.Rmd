# Introduction

The Theil-Sen estimator [@Theil1950; @sen1968estimates] is arguably the
most popular non-parametric and robust alternative to the least squares
estimator for estimating the slope in simple linear regression. A
variation on this estimator, Siegel's repeated median slope
[@siegel1982robust], was the first slope estimator to attain the maximal
breakdown value of 50 %, which roughly means that it can withstand up to
50% of outliers in the data. Since their introduction, these estimators
have seen widespread use in a variety of applications including signal
extraction [@davies2004robust; @gather2006online], filtering
[@fried2006repeated; @bernholt2006modified; @fried2007weighted; @gelper2010robust],
computer vision [@meer1991robust], climatology
[@zhang2000temperature; @zhai2005trends; @kosaka2013recent] and very
recently differentially private estimation
[@alabi2020differentially; @fu2021attackresistant].

Several implementations of these estimators exist, most notably in the R
packages [deming](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=deming)
[@R:deming], [zyp](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=zyp) [@R:zyp],
[mblm](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=mblm) [@R:mblm], and
[RobustLinearReg](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=RobustLinearReg)
[@R:RobustLinearReg], all publicly available on CRAN. Despite their
popularity and importance, all of these publicly available
implementations are based on a brute-force computation of the (repeated)
median slope. Given a sample of $n$ observations, this approach requires
a computational cost of $\mathcal{O}(n^2)$ as well as $\mathcal{O}(n^2)$
space. This makes the currently available implementations unsuitable for
modern applications involving larger data sets as they are rather slow
and potentially use prohibitively large amounts of storage space.

Nevertheless, there exist several algorithms for the Theil-Sen and
repeated median estimators which run in quasilinear time and require
only $\mathcal{O}(n)$ space. For the Theil-Sen estimator,
@cole1989optimal, @katz1993optimal, and @bronnimann1998optimal proposed
algorithms running in $\mathcal{O}(n\log(n))$ deterministic time. A
randomized algorithm requiring $\mathcal{O}(n\log(n))$-expected time was
proposed in @matouvsek1991randomized, @dillencourt1992randomized and
@Shafer1993RandomizingOG. For the repeated median slope,
@stein1992finding, @matouvsek1993efficient and @matouvsek1998efficient
proposed algorithms running in $\mathcal{O}(n\log(n))$ and
$\mathcal{O}(n\log(n)^2)$ (-expected) time. A potential explanation for
these algorithms not being available in R may be twofold. Firstly, they
are all more involved than brute-force computation of the median slopes
and sample implementations in other programming languages are scarce, if
available at all. Secondly, most of them make efficient use of features
not (readily) available in R, such as pointers and in-place assignment,
as well as complex data structures.

In this article we discuss the R package
[robslopes](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=robslopes) [@R:robslopes]
which contains implementations of the randomized algorithms by
@matouvsek1991randomized and @matouvsek1998efficient for the Theil-Sen
and repeated median estimators respectively. The original algorithms
have been adjusted in order to properly deal with potential duplicates
in the data. We start by briefly reviewing the problem setting and the
estimators. Next, we present a rough outline of the key ideas underlying
the algorithms and a brief description of the usage of the functions in
the package. We end with a benchmarking study comparing the
implementation with existing implementations in publicly available R
packages and concluding remarks.

# The Theil-Sen and repeated median estimators {#sec:meth}

The typical problem setting of slope estimation is that of the simple
linear model. Suppose we have $n$ observations $(x_i, y_i)$ which follow
the model $$y_i = \alpha + \beta x_i + e_i$$ where $\alpha$ and $\beta$
are the (unknown) true intercept and slope parameters and $e_i$
represents the noise. The most popular estimator for the regression
coefficients is the ordinary least squares (OLS) estimator, i.e. the
$(\hat{\alpha}, \hat{\beta})$ minimizing
$\sum_{i=1}^{n}{(y_i - \hat{\alpha}-\hat{\beta}x_i)^2}$. The OLS
estimator possesses several attractive properties, including ease of
computation and interpretation and optimal performance when the errors
are i.i.d. and follow a normal distribution. Despite these properties,
it is well known that the OLS estimator is very sensitive to outliers
and can have a quickly deteriorating performance as the error term
deviates from normality. For these reasons, many alternatives have been
suggested, of which the Theil-Sen estimator and Siegel's repeated median
slope are two popular and intuitively attractive examples.

The Theil-Sen (TS) estimator [@Theil1950; @sen1968estimates] of $\beta$
is defined as the median of the slopes of all the lines determined by
two different observations $(x_i,y_i)$ and $(x_j, y_j)$:
$$\hat{\beta}_{ \mbox{\tiny TS}}(\bm{x},\bm{y})=\mathop{\mathrm{\mbox{med}}}_{i\neq j} \frac{y_i - y_j}{x_i - x_j},$$
where the median avoids $i=j$ as the slope through one point is
undefined and where $\bm{x}= x_1, \ldots, x_n$ and
$\bm{y}= y_1, \ldots, y_n$. In case there are duplicate values in
$x_1,\ldots,x_n$, the proposal of [@sen1968estimates] is to only include
the slopes which are constructed using two observations with different
$x$-values and we adopt this approach here.

The TS estimator has been analyzed extensively from a theoretical point
of view. [@sen1968estimates] showed its asymptotic normality and
equivariance properties. In particular, we have

1.  scale equivariance:
    $\hat{\beta}_{ \mbox{\tiny TS}}(\bm{x},c\bm{y}) = c\hat{\beta}_{ \mbox{\tiny TS}}(\bm{x},\bm{y})$
    for all $c \in \mathbb{R}$

2.  regression equivariance
    $\hat{\beta}_{ \mbox{\tiny TS}}(\bm{x},\bm{y}+ a\bm{x}) = \hat{\beta}_{ \mbox{\tiny TS}}(\bm{x},\bm{y})  + a$
    for all $a \in \mathbb{R}$,

but the estimator is not equivariant under affine transformations of
both predictor and response variables. [@Wang2005] give precise
conditions for the unbiasedness of the TS estimator and
[@wilcox1998note] studied its behavior in the case of heteroscedastic
errors. From a robust statistics perspective, it is known that the TS
estimator is much more robust against outliers than the OLS estimator
(see [@rousseeuw2005robust]). In particular, it has a bounded influence
function [@Hampel:IFapproach] and its breakdown value is
$1 - \sqrt{\frac{1}{2}} \approx 0.293 \%$, where the latter can be
roughly interpreted as the maximum percentage of contaminated samples
that the estimator can handle (see [@Donoho:BDP] for an exact
definition). Finally, its maximum bias properties under contamination
have been studied by [@adrover2004bias].\
The search for a slope estimator with a breakdown value higher than 30%
prompted Siegel to propose the repeated median (RM) slope
[@siegel1982robust]. It is the first slope estimator attaining the
maximal breakdown value of 50%. The repeated median estimator of $\beta$
is computed by first calculating the median slope per observation $x_i$,
yielding $n$ values, and then taking the median of these values:
$$\hat{\beta}_{\mbox{\tiny RM}}(\bm{x},\bm{y})=\mathop{\mathrm{\mbox{med}}}_i \mathop{\mathrm{\mbox{med}}}_{j\neq i} \frac{y_j - y_i}{x_j - x_i},$$
where now the inner median avoids $i=j$. We handle duplicate values in
$x_1,\ldots,x_n$ by skipping them in the computation of the inner
median, in the same spirit as duplicate handling for the TS estimator.
The consistency, unbiasedness and efficiency of the RM estimator were
discussed by [@siegel1982robust], whereas the asymptotic normality was
analyzed in [@hossjer1994asymptotics]. The estimator was designed to
have a 50 % asymptotic breakdown value, and like the TS estimator, its
influence function is also bounded
[@rousseeuw1992new; @rousseeuw1995sensitivity; @rousseeuw2005robust].
Finally, it possesses the same equivariance properties as the TS
estimator, i.e. it is both scale and regression equivariant but not
affine equivariant, and its maximum bias properties are also discussed
in [@adrover2004bias].

It is clear that both $\hat{\beta}_{ \mbox{\tiny TS}}$ and
$\hat{\beta}_{\mbox{\tiny RM}}$ can be computed by calculating all
$\frac{n(n-1)}{2}$ pairwise slopes, and selecting the median or repeated
median of these slopes. Clearly, this brute-force approach has a
$\mathcal{O}(n^2)$ computational cost, and the available implementations
of this approach also require storing the $\mathcal{O}(n^2)$ slopes. In
the next section, we describe the more efficient algorithms implemented
in the robslopes package.

While not the main focus of this article, it is worth mentioning that
the intercept can be estimated in several ways. We opt for the most
straight-forward approach of taking the median of the residuals as the
estimator for $\alpha$:
$$\hat{\alpha}= \mathop{\mathrm{\mbox{med}}}_i \left(y_i - \hat{\beta}x_i\right),$$
where $\hat{\beta}$ can be $\hat{\beta}_{ \mbox{\tiny TS}}$ or
$\hat{\beta}_{\mbox{\tiny RM}}$.

# Randomized algorithms for slope selection {#sec:algo}

The R-package robslopes contains an implementation of the randomized
algorithm by @matouvsek1991randomized for the Theil-Sen estimator and
the algorithm of @matouvsek1993efficient [@matouvsek1998efficient] for
the repeated median estimator. Unlike in their original proposals, we
haven taken into account the case of possible duplicate values in the
$x_i$ and adjusted the algorithms to work properly in that case as well.
We now briefly outline these algorithms without going too much into
detail. For specific details and a complete description we refer to the
original references and our code.

Suppose we are given $n$ data points $(x_i, y_i)$ with $i = 1,\ldots,n$
and we are interested in the median (or more generally, any order
statistic) of the slopes formed by connecting two data points. The main
idea behind the algorithms is to consider each observed data point
$(x_i, y_i)$ in dual space by associating it with the line
$$v = x_i u - y_i.$$ We will denote the coordinates in dual space with
$(u,v)$ in the following. It can be verified that the $u$-coordinate of
the intersection of two lines in dual space (also called "intersection
abscissa" (IA)) is equal to the slope of the line passing through the
two points in the original space. Therefore, the problem of finding
order statistics of slopes can be translated into the problem of finding
order statistics of intersection abscissas in dual space. To find these
order statistics in dual space, the algorithms use the following idea.
Given an interval $(u_{ \mbox{\tiny low}},u_{ \mbox{\tiny high}}]$ in
dual space, the number of IAs in that interval can be computed by
counting the number of inversions in a certain permutation. For a
permutation $\pi$ on $1,\ldots,n$, an inversion is a pair of elements
$(\pi(i),\pi(j))$ for which $i<j$ and $\pi(i) > \pi(j)$. Figure
[1](#fig:illustrateInversions){reference-type="ref"
reference="fig:illustrateInversions"} shows three lines in dual space
and illustrates the connection between IAs and inversions which works as
follows. Suppose we have two lines associated with the points
$(x_i,y_i)$ and $(x_j,y_j)$. The $v$-coordinates of the intersection of
these lines with $u_{ \mbox{\tiny low}}$ in dual space are given by
$x_i u_{ \mbox{\tiny low}}- y_i$ and $x_ju_{ \mbox{\tiny low}}- y_j$
respectively. Suppose without loss of generality that
$x_i u_{ \mbox{\tiny low}}- y_i < x_ju_{ \mbox{\tiny low}}- y_j$. Now,
if lines $i$ and $j$ intersect in the interval
$(u_{ \mbox{\tiny low}},u_{ \mbox{\tiny high}}]$, we must have that the
$v$-coordinate of the intersection of these lines with
$u_{ \mbox{\tiny high}}$ have switched order:
$x_i u_{ \mbox{\tiny high}}- y_i > x_ju_{ \mbox{\tiny high}}- y_j$.
Therefore, there is a bijection between the IAs in
$(u_{ \mbox{\tiny low}},u_{ \mbox{\tiny high}}]$ and the permutation
obtained by going from the order of the intersections of the lines with
$u =  u_{ \mbox{\tiny low}}$ to the order of the intersections with
$u = u_{ \mbox{\tiny high}}$. Counting the number of inversions in a
permutation can be done in $\mathcal{O}(n\log(n))$ time using an
adaptation of merge sort [@knuth1998art], and constructing the
permutation itself has the same computational complexity.

![Three lines in dual space, restricted to the interval
$(u_{ \mbox{\tiny low}},u_{ \mbox{\tiny high}}]$. If two lines intersect
in this interval, the ordering of their values of the $v$-coordinate at
$u_{ \mbox{\tiny low}}$ and $u_{ \mbox{\tiny high}}$ must have turned
around. Therefore, the number of IAs in the interval
$(u_{ \mbox{\tiny low}},u_{ \mbox{\tiny high}}]$ is given by the number
of inversions in the permutation
$(3 \; 1 \; 2)$.](illustration_inversions.pdf){#fig:illustrateInversions
width="50%"}

For the Theil-Sen estimator, we obtain $n(n-1)$ IAs in dual space, where
parallel lines meet at $+\infty$ by convention. Suppose we want to find
the $k$-th smallest IA (e.g., $k$ could be $\lfloor (n(n-1)+1)/2\rfloor$
for the lower median). The idea is to maintain a half-open interval
$(u_{ \mbox{\tiny low}},u_{ \mbox{\tiny high}}]$, which is initialized
at $(-\infty, \infty]$ and always contains the IA we are looking for. We
also keep a count $L$ and $C$ of the total number of IAs to the left and
within the interval respectively. If the number of IAs in the interval
is of order $\mathcal{O}(n)$, we can enumerate them in
$\mathcal{O}(n\log(n))$ time and select the desired element (we call
this "brute-force computation"). If there are more IAs left in the
interval, we use a contraction strategy which makes the interval
$(u_{ \mbox{\tiny low}},u_{ \mbox{\tiny high}}]$ progressively smaller
while still containing the target $k$-th smallest slope, until it is
small enough for brute-force computation.

In order to contract the interval, we randomly sample a $\mathcal{O}(n)$
number of IAs. These are then used to estimate a new interval
$(u_{ \mbox{\tiny low}}',u_{ \mbox{\tiny high}}']\subset (u_{ \mbox{\tiny low}},u_{ \mbox{\tiny high}}]$
which contains the target IA with high probability. To check whether the
contracted interval contains the target, we count the number of IAs in
the intervals $(u_{ \mbox{\tiny low}}, u_{ \mbox{\tiny low}}']$ and
$(u_{ \mbox{\tiny low}}',u_{ \mbox{\tiny high}}']$. If the current count
$L$ added to the number of IAs in the former interval exceeds $k$, we
know that the target IA is in
$(u_{ \mbox{\tiny low}}, u_{ \mbox{\tiny low}}']$. If not, we check
whether additionally adding the number of IAs in
$(u_{ \mbox{\tiny low}}',u_{ \mbox{\tiny high}}']$ gives a total count
exceeding $k$, in which case the target IA is in
$(u_{ \mbox{\tiny low}}', u_{ \mbox{\tiny high}}']$. If neither of those
cases hold, we know the target IA is in
$(u_{ \mbox{\tiny high}}', u_{ \mbox{\tiny high}}]$. After the
contraction, we update $L$ and $C$ and this process is repeated until
$C$, the number of IAs in the current interval, is of the order
$\mathcal{O}(n)$. To execute this strategy, we need a method to randomly
sample IAs. It turns out that this can be achieved in
$\mathcal{O}(n\log(n))$ time, again using an adaptation of merge sort.
For the Theil-Sen estimator there is an expected $\mathcal{O}(1)$ number
of iterations required for convergence, leading to a total expected
complexity of $\mathcal{O}(n\log(n))$.

For the repeated median estimator, the algorithm is similar to the
previously described algorithm in that it also works with an
interval-contraction strategy. In contrast with the previous algorithm
however, we now keep track of the lines for which the median IA falls
within the interval, in addition to the number of abscissas on the left
and within the current interval for each individual line. In each
contraction step, we first sample a $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{n})$ number of
lines for which we know that their median IA lies within the current
interval. For each of these lines, a $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{n})$ number of
IAs are now sampled which allow for the estimation of a new interval
$(u_{ \mbox{\tiny low}}',u_{ \mbox{\tiny high}}']\subset (u_{ \mbox{\tiny low}},u_{ \mbox{\tiny high}}]$
containing the target slope with high probability. The interval
$(u_{ \mbox{\tiny low}},u_{ \mbox{\tiny high}}]$ can then be contracted
by counting the number of IAs for each line on the left and within
$(u_{ \mbox{\tiny low}}',u_{ \mbox{\tiny high}}']$. As before, the
algorithm switches to brute-force computation once the number of IAs in
$(u_{ \mbox{\tiny low}},u_{ \mbox{\tiny high}}]$ is of the order
$\mathcal{O}(n)$. For this algorithm, there is an expected
$\mathcal{O}(\log(n))$ number of contraction steps required, resulting
in a total complexity of $\mathcal{O}(n\log^2(n))$.

The original algorithms were only described for the case where the $x_i$
values are all distinct. In case of duplicate values however, some of
the slopes are not defined and the natural way of handling this is by
ignoring the undefined slopes and computing the median (or any other
order statistic) on the remaining slopes. Fortunately, we can
incorporate this into our algorithms by realizing that these duplicate
$x_i$ values correspond with parallel lines in dual space. Using the
convention that parallel lines in dual space meet at $+\infty$, the
(repeated) median slope can be found by appropriately adjusting the
value of the order statistic of the slope we want to find. For the
Theil-Sen estimator, this means we need to find the order statistic
corresponding with $\frac{n(n-1)}{2}-\sum_{i=1}^n{\frac{d_i-1}{2}}$
values, where $d_i$ denotes the number of times the value $x_i$ occurs
in the predictor variable. For the repeated median estimator, we only
have to adjust the inner median, but the adjustment is dependent on the
individual line $i$. More specifically, the order statistic for the
inner median needs to be computed on $n-d_i$ values. Note that we can
count the number of duplicates easily in $\mathcal{O}(n)$ time and so
the overall complexity of the algorithm is not affected by this change.
There is one additional complication, namely that of duplicate pairs
$(x_i, y_i)$. If such pairs are present, one should be careful with
computing the permutation of intersections in dual space given an
interval $(u_{ \mbox{\tiny low}}, u_{ \mbox{\tiny high}}]$. Obtaining
such a permutation involves sorting (and ranking) a vector of IAs.
However, in case of duplicate pairs, this sorting needs to be done using
stable sort. If not, duplicate pairs may randomly produce inversions,
yielding sampled IAs at $\infty$ even if the current interval has
$u_{ \mbox{\tiny high}}< \infty$. In the original algorithm, this
scenario was not considered and thus not explicitly accounted for. These
changes have been incorporated in the implementation provided in the
robslopes package.

# Implementation and usage {#sec:impl}

We briefly describe the implementation and usage of the functions in the
robslopes package. The package revolves around 2 main functions, the
TheilSen function and the RepeatedMedian function, both returning a list
with the self-explanatory elements intercept and slope. Both functions
start with input checking and duplicate counting, which are done in R.
The duplicate counts are then used to set the correct target order
statistics for the main part of the algorithm. This information is then
passed on to the randomized algorithms which are implemented in C++,
making use of the
[rcpparmadillo](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=rcpparmadillo)
package [@eddelbuettel2011rcpp; @rcpparmadillo].

The TheilSen function has the layout TheilSen(x, y, alpha = NULL,
verbose = TRUE), where the x and y arguments are the input vectors for
the predictor and response variable respectively. The verbose option
allows for switching off the printing of the computation progress.
Finally, the alpha argument is a value between 0 and 1 which determines
the order statistic corresponding with the target slope. When alpha =
NULL, the default, the upper median of the $m$ slopes is computed, which
corresponds with the $\lfloor (m + 2) / 2\rfloor$-th order statistic.
For any other value of $0\leq$ alpha$\leq 1$, the function computes the
$[$ alpha$\;m]$-th order statistic of the slopes, where $[\cdot]$ is the
rounding operator.

The RepeatedMedian function has the layout RepeatedMedian(x, y, alpha =
NULL, beta = NULL, verbose = TRUE), where the x, y and verbose arguments
play the same role as for the TheilSen function. The arguments alpha and
beta determine the order statistics of the inner and outer "median".
When NULL, the default, they again correspond to the upper median. If
they contain values between zero and one, the order statistics
corresponding with the inner and outer "median" are given by $[$
alpha$\;m]$ and $[$ beta$\;m]$ respectively.

For convenience, the TheilSen and RepeatedMedian functions have been
wrapped in the user-friendly functions robslope and robslope.fit. These
mimic the structure of common regression functions (e.g., lm and
lm.fit). In particular, robslope takes the standard arguments formula,
data, subset, weights and na.action, in addition to the type argument
selecting which type of slope to compute, as well as the optional alpha,
beta and verbose arguments of the TheilSen and RepeatedMedian functions.

As an example we analyze the flights data of the
[nycflights13](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=nycflights13) package
[@R:nycflights]. It contains on-time data for all flights that departed
in New York City (i.e. JFK, LGA or EWR airports) in 2013. We consider
the distance traveled in miles as the predictor variable, and take the
air time in minutes as the response. After removing all NA values, we
end up with a data set of 327,346 observations. In contrast to the
previous example, this one is too large to compute the TS or RM slope
with a brute-force algorithm (on most computers). We now calculate the
TS and RM slopes three times each, where we change the inner order
statistic to the first, second and third quartiles. With the exception
of graphical parameters, the code executed is shown below.

::: example

col = \"green\", lwd = 3) abline(coef(rm.out.75), col = \"blue\", lwd =
3)
:::

The resulting figure is shown in Figure
[\[fig:flights\]](#fig:flights){reference-type="ref"
reference="fig:flights"}. In this example, the slopes calculated by the
TS and RM estimators are virtually identical due to the very limited
number of outliers and the large number of data points. Note that there
are many duplicates in this data set, which are handled appropriately by
the proposed implementation.

# Benchmarking study {#sec:bench}

We now benchmark the implemented algorithm against the existing
implementations in the deming, zyp, mblm, and RobustLinearReg packages.
Note that the deming and zyp packages only contain the TS estimator, the
others contain both the TS and RM estimators. All simulations were done
using the R-package
[microbenchmark](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=microbenchmark)
[@microbenchmark] and were run on an Intel Core i7-10750H \@2.60GHz
processor. The setup is as follows. For each value of
$n = \{10, 10^2, 10^3, 10^4\}$, we have generated 100 samples
$(x_i,y_i)$ from the bivariate standard normal distribution. Afterward,
each of the available implementations was used to estimate the
regression parameters and the execution time was measured (in
nanoseconds).

The following code snippets show the code used for benchmarking the TS
and RM estimator for a sample of size $n = 10^3$, the same code was used
for the other sample sizes, with exception of $n = 10^4$, in which case
the implementation of the mblm package was left out due to its
computational burden (it takes several hours to compute it once).

:::

Figure [\[fig:bench_TS\]](#fig:bench_TS){reference-type="ref"
reference="fig:bench_TS"} shows the results for the Theil-Sen estimator.
We see that for the smallest sample size, $n = 10$, the absolute
computation times are extremely low and while there are visible
differences, they are probably not of practical relevance. For $n=100$,
the robslopes package is roughly five times faster than the fastest
competitor, and the mblm implementation starts to run away from the
other competitors. For $n = 10^3$, the differences become much clearer.
The robslopes implementation is now between one and two orders of
magnitude faster than the best competitor. Finally, for $n = 10^4$ the
gap widens further to a difference of over two orders of magnitude. Note
that for $n = 10^4$, we have left out the mblm package in the comparison
as a single run takes several hours and the resulting plot would hinder
a clear comparison.

Figure [\[fig:bench_RM\]](#fig:bench_RM){reference-type="ref"
reference="fig:bench_RM"} shows the results for the RM estimator. As for
the TS estimator, the difference in computation time is already visible
for small sample sizes of $n=10$ and $n=100$, where the robslopes
implementation is roughly a factor 20 faster than the competition.
However, the absolute computation times for these sample sizes is by no
means prohibitive for any of the implementations. Starting at $n = 1000$
however, we start to see a larger difference, especially between the
robslopes and mblm implementations. The former is now roughly 800 times
faster than the latter, and 60 times faster than the RobustLinearReg
implementation. For sample size $n = 10^4$, we did not include the mblm
implementation as it now takes roughly half an hour to compute, in
contrast with 16 seconds for the RobustLinearReg implementation and
0.034 seconds (on average) for the robslopes implementation. Finally
note that interestingly, the repeated median of the mblm package is much
faster than the Theil-Sen estimator of the same package. This is
somewhat counter-intuitive, but turns out to be caused by a much higher
number of calls to the c() function (concatenate) in the implementation
of the TS estimator.

As explained before, the brute-force implementations of the (repeated)
median slope require $\mathcal{O}(n^2)$ storage as they typically
compute all slopes and store them in a $n\times n$ matrix. Therefore,
while a sample size of $n=10^4$ is by no means extremely large, we
cannot go much higher than that. A sample size of $n=10^5$ for example,
would require a RAM memory of about 75GB, which is rather uncommon on
most computers and laptops. The implementations in the robslopes package
however, require only $\mathcal{O}(n)$ storage space, and we can thus
easily compute the estimators on much larger samples. To illustrate
this, we have continued the benchmarking study with only the robslopes
implementation, but this time for the sample sizes $n = 10^5, 10^6$ and
$10^7$. This was done using the following code snippet, where the saving
of the results in the for loop is omitted:

::: example
for (n in 10\^(5:7)) mbm \<- microbenchmark(\"robslopes\" =
robslopes::TheilSen(x, y), setup = x = rnorm(n); y = rnorm(n); data =
as.data.frame(cbind(x, y)), times = 100)

for (n in 10\^(5:7)) mbm \<- microbenchmark(\"robslopes\" =
robslopes::RepeatedMedian(x, y), setup = x = rnorm(n); y = rnorm(n);
data = as.data.frame(cbind(x, y)), times = 100)

Figure [\[fig:bench_largen\]](#fig:bench_largen){reference-type="ref"
reference="fig:bench_largen"} shows the mean computation times of the TS
estimator and the RM estimator for sample sizes up to $n = 10^7$. As an
example, for a sample size of $n=10^6$, the TS estimator requires
roughly 4 seconds of computation time, whereas the RM estimator requires
roughly 6 seconds. The blue shade on the figure indicates the maximum
and minimum computation time over the 100 replications, showing that the
computation times have a fairly small variance around their mean. The
red line shows a (robustly) estimated fit of the theoretical computation
times to the observed ones (i.e. of the functions
$f(n) = \beta n \log(n)$ and $f(n) = \beta n \log^2(n)$ for a
$\beta \in \mathbb{R}$), indicating that for $n\geq 10^3$, the observed
computational cost grows according to the theoretical complexity.

# Summary {#sec:conc}

We have introduced the robslopes package which contains fast
implementations of the popular Theil-Sen and repeated median slope
estimators. The implemented algorithms are randomized algorithms running
in quasilinear expected time and use linear space. In contrast, the
currently available implementations in different R packages on CRAN
require quadratic time and space. A benchmark study comparing the common
implementations of the slope estimator with the newly introduced one
illustrates speedups up to a factor $10^3$ compared with the next best
alternative implementation for common sample sizes. Additionally, due to
the linear space requirements of the algorithms, the slope estimators
can be computed on much larger sample sizes than the current maximum.
Finally, the original algorithms were adjusted to properly deal with
potential duplicates in the predictor variable.

The fast implementation of these popular slope estimators unlocks new
possibilities for their use in modern applications where the slope has
to be estimated repeatedly and on a large number of data points.
Evidently, inferential procedures based on bootstrapping are also highly
facilitated by these fast algorithms. Finally, the underlying C++
implementation may serve as a useful reference for implementations of
these algorithms in other programming languages, which also seem to be
scarce.
