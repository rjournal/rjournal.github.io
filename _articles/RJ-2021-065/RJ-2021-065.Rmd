title: 'The bdpar Package: Big Data Pipelining Architecture for R'
abstract: ' In the last years, big data has become a useful paradigm for taking advantage
  of multiple sources to find relevant knowledge in real domains (such as the design
  of personalized marketing campaigns or helping to palliate the effects of several
  fatal diseases). Big data programming tools and methods have evolved over time from
  a MapReduce to a pipeline-based archetype. Concretely the use of pipelining schemes
  has become the most reliable way of processing and analyzing large amounts of data.
  To this end, this work introduces bdpar, a new highly customizable pipeline-based
  framework (using the OOP paradigm provided by [R6](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=R6)
  package) able to execute multiple preprocessing tasks over heterogeneous data sources.
  Moreover, to increase the flexibility and performance, bdpar provides helpful features
  such as (i) the definition of a novel object-based pipe operator ( %\>\|%), (ii)
  the ability to easily design and deploy new (and customized) input data parsers,
  tasks, and pipelines, (iii) only-once execution which avoids the execution of previously
  processed information (instances), guaranteeing that only new both input data and
  pipelines are executed, (iv) the capability to perform serial or parallel operations
  according to the user needs, (v) the inclusion of a debugging mechanism which allows
  users to check the status of each instance (and find possible errors) throughout
  the process. '
