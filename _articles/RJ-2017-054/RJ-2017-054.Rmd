title: 'ider: Intrinsic Dimension Estimation with R'
abstract: In many data analyses, the dimensionality of the observed data is high while
  its intrinsic dimension remains quite low. Estimating the intrinsic dimension of
  an observed dataset is an essential preliminary step for dimensionality reduction,
  manifold learning, and visualization. This paper introduces an R package, named
  ider, that implements eight intrinsic dimension estimation methods, including a
  recently proposed method based on a second-order expansion of a probability mass
  function and a generalized linear model. The usage of each function in the package
  is explained with datasets generated using a function that is also included in the
  package.
