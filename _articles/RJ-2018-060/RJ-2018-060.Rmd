title: 'lmridge: A Comprehensive R Package for Ridge Regression'
abstract: The ridge regression estimator, one of the commonly used alternatives to
  the conventional ordinary least squares estimator, avoids the adverse effects in
  the situations when there exists some considerable degree of multicollinearity among
  the regressors. There are many software packages available for estimation of ridge
  regression coefficients. However, most of them display limited methods to estimate
  the ridge biasing parameters without testing procedures. Our developed package,
  lmridge can be used to estimate ridge coefficients considering a range of different
  existing biasing parameters, to test these coefficients with more than 25 ridge
  related statistics, and to present different graphical displays of these statistics.
