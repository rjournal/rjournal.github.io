title: A Multiscale Test of Spatial Stationarity for Textured Images in R
abstract: The ability to automatically identify areas of homogeneous texture present
  within a greyscale image is an important feature of image processing algorithms.
  This article describes the R package LS2Wstat which employs a recent wavelet-based
  test of stationarity for locally stationary random fields to assess such spatial
  homogeneity. By embedding this test within a quadtree image segmentation procedure
  we are also able to identify texture regions within an image.
