title: Let Graphics Tell the Story - Datasets in R
abstract: Graphics are good for showing the information in datasets and for complementing
  modelling. Sometimes graphics show information models miss, sometimes graphics help
  to make model results more understandable, and sometimes models show whether information
  from graphics has statistical support or not. It is the interplay of the two approaches
  that is valuable. Graphics could be used a lot more in R examples and we explore
  this idea with some datasets available in R packages.
