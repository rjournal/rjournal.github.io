title: 'cchs: An R Package for Stratified Case-Cohort Studies'
abstract: The cchs package contains a function, also called cchs, for analyzing data
  from a stratified case-cohort study, as used in epidemiology. For data from this
  type of study, cchs calculates Estimator III of Borgan et al. (2000), which is a
  score-unbiased estimator for the regression coefficients in the Cox proportional
  hazards model. From the userâ€™s point of view, the function is similar to coxph (in
  the survival package) and other widely used model-fitting functions. Convenient
  software has not previously been available for Estimator III since it is complicated
  to calculate. SAS and S-Plus code-fragments for the calculation have been published,
  but cchs is easier to use and more efficient in terms of time and memory, and can
  cope with much larger datasets. It also avoids several minor approximations and
  simplifications.
