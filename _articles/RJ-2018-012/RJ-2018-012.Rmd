title: 'cchs: An R Package for Stratified Case-Cohort Studies'
abstract: The [*cchs*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=cchs) package contains a
  function, also called `cchs`, for analyzing data from a stratified case-cohort study,
  as used in epidemiology. For data from this type of study, `cchs` calculates Estimator
  III of @borgan2000, which is a score-unbiased estimator for the regression coefficients
  in the Cox proportional hazards model. From the user's point of view, the function
  is similar to `coxph` (in the [*survival*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=survival)
  package) and other widely used model-fitting functions. Convenient software has
  not previously been available for Estimator III since it is complicated to calculate.
  SAS and S-Plus code-fragments for the calculation have been published, but `cchs`
  is easier to use and more efficient in terms of time and memory, and can cope with
  much larger datasets. It also avoids several minor approximations and simplifications.

# Introduction

One common type of study in epidemiology is the cohort study, in which
participants are recruited and followed over time. Participants who
experience a certain type of event (e.g., a heart attack or the
diagnosis of a disease) are called cases, and participants who do not
are called non-cases or controls. A related type of study is the
case-cohort study, which is nested within a cohort study. In a
case-cohort study, some of the covariates are only measured for the
cases and the subcohort---the subcohort is a randomly selected subset of
the cohort. These covariates are not measured for the other
participants. A case-cohort study can often estimate effect-sizes almost
as accurately as the corresponding cohort study, but at much lower cost
since measuring all the covariates on all the participants is expensive.

The case-cohort dataset contains only the cases and the subcohort, and
is usually analyzed with a Cox proportional hazards regression model
[@cox1972]. A common way to fit the Cox model is to use the estimator of
@prentice1986, who proposed the case-cohort design. More advanced kinds
of analysis sometimes use information on the full cohort, such as the
values of those covariates that were measured for all the participants.

In a stratified case-cohort study, the selection of the subcohort is
stratified. The cohort is divided into strata and each stratum is
assigned a sampling fraction, which is the number of participants in
that stratum who will be in the subcohort divided by the total number of
participants in the stratum. The purpose of the stratification is
usually to improve the efficiency of the estimator. To fit a Cox model
to data from a stratified case-cohort study, one possible estimator is
the time-fixed version of Estimator III of @borgan2000. This estimator
is optimal in the sense that it is score-unbiased; this criterion is
explained in the section "[3](#sec:Comparisonwithotherestimators)". In
this article, "Estimator III" means the time-fixed version of Borgan et
al.'s Estimator III, unless otherwise stated.

The subject of this article is the
[*cchs*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=cchs) package (version
0.4.0; [@cchsPackage]), which has made Estimator III available in a
convenient form. The package consists of a single function, also called
`cchs`, which calculates the estimator, and an example dataset, called
`cchsData`.

Previous software for calculating Estimator III includes SAS code [@sas]
that appears in @langholz2007 and S-Plus code [@splus] in the appendix
of @cologne2012. S-Plus is no longer available for purchase but is very
similar to R; @cologne2012's code works in R if one function,
`match.data.frame`, is imported from S-Plus.

The previously published SAS and S-Plus code-fragments both analyze
specific datasets with specific models. They could be rewritten to work
more generally, but even then with some datasets they would give
slightly inaccurate results, and with others they would use far too much
computational time or memory to be usable, as explained later in the
article. Langholz and Jiao wrote more general SAS code [available at
@langholzWebsite], but this still has the problems with inaccurate
results and computational resources and is less easy to use than `cchs`.
@cologne2012 state that Estimator III can be calculated by an
application called Epicure, which is now sold by Risk Sciences
International. The estimator was also calculated by Borgan et al.
themselves, but their code is not publicly available.

The `cch` function in the
[*survival*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=survival) package
[@survival-package; @survival-book] can calculate several estimators for
case-cohort data, including the estimator of @prentice1986 and
Estimators I and II of @borgan2000. The functionality of `cchs` could be
added to `cch` as a single additional option. But Estimator III is
complicated to calculate and `cchs` has numerous features that `cch`
lacks. Other software for stratified case-cohort studies includes the
[*survey*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=survey) and
[*NestedCohort*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=NestedCohort)
packages, which use inverse probability weights
[@lumley2004; @lumley2017a; @mark2006; @katki2008], and the code for
Estimator II in @samuelsen2007.

The next five sections discuss the model, the estimator, and how to use
`cchs`. The function is easy to use for anyone who is accustomed to the
syntax of model-fitting functions in R such as `lm` or `coxph`. The
subsequent sections discuss how `cchs` works internally compared to the
previously published SAS and S-Plus code. The previously published code
makes several approximations and is unable to cope with large datasets,
but `cchs` avoids these drawbacks by manipulating the data in an
economical way, leading to huge savings in computational time and
memory.

Parts of `cchs` are based on code from `coxph`, `cch`, and the appendix
of @cologne2012, and the mathematical formulas and some of the
computational methods are from @therneau1999, @borgan2000,
@langholz2007, and @cologne2012, but a major part of the computational
methods is original, as discussed in the section
"[7](#sec:Howcchsworks)".

The idea of creating `cchs` came from work on EPIC-InterAct
[@interact2011] and EPIC-CVD [@danesh2007], two stratified case-cohort
studies that are nested within the cohort from EPIC, the European
Prospective Investigation of Cancer and Nutrition [@bingham2004].
EPIC-InterAct is a study of incident type 2 diabetes with data from 29
centers in eight European countries, where the subcohort was stratified
by center or country. EPIC-CVD is a study of cardiovascular disease that
uses most of the same centers as EPIC-InterAct and the same subcohort in
those centers. In @jones2015, data from EPIC-InterAct was used to
compare five different models for data from stratified case-cohort
studies, and a pre-release version of `cchs` was used to fit two of
those models.

# The model and the estimator {#sec:Themodelandtheestimator}

The Cox model for survival-time data is commonly defined by this
equation:
$$h_i(t) = h_0(t) \exp(\beta^\top z_i),$$
where

-   $h_i$ is the hazard function for participant $i$,
-   $t$ is the time to the event,
-   $h_0$ is the baseline hazard function,
-   $\beta$ is the regression coefficients (log hazard ratios), and
-   $z_i$ is the covariates for participant $i$.

If all the event-times are distinct, then the partial likelihood is
$$\prod_j \frac{\exp(\beta^\top z_{i_j})}{\sum_k Y_k (t_j) \exp(\beta^\top z_k)},$$
where

-   $t_j$ is the $j$th event-time,
-   $i_j$ is the participant whose event happened at time $t_j$,
-   $Y_k (t_j) = \begin{cases} 1 & \text{if } t_j \in (t_{0k}, t_{1k}] \\ 0 & \text{otherwise} \end{cases}$,
-   $t_{0k}$ is the entry-time for participant $k$ (often zero for all
    participants), and
-   $t_{1k}$ is the exit-time for participant $k$ (i.e. the time at
    which they had the event or were censored).

The product is over all the cases and the sum is over all the
participants. The time-interval $(t_{0k}, t_{1k}]$ is participant $k$'s
"at-risk time" and $Y_k (t_j)$ is an indicator variable for whether
participant $k$ is at risk at time $t_j$.

For case-cohort data, $z_i$ is only known for the cases and subcohort
members, so the partial likelihood cannot be evaluated and it is
impossible to estimate the regression coefficients using the method of
maximum likelihood. Instead, the coefficients are estimated by
maximizing pseudo-likelihoods, which are approximations of the partial
likelihood. The pseudo-likelihood for Estimator III is
$$\prod_j \frac{\alpha_{s(i_j)} ^ {-1} \exp(\beta^\top z_{i_j})}{\sum_{k \in R(t_j)} Y_k (t_j) \alpha_{s(k)} ^ {-1} \exp(\beta^\top z_k)},$$
where

-   $s(i)$ is the stratum that contains participant $i$,
-   $\alpha_s$ is the sampling fraction for stratum $s$ (the proportion
    of stratum $s$ that appears in the subcohort),
-   $R(t_j ) = \begin{cases} C & \text{if } i_j \in C \\ C \cup \{i_j\} \setminus \{J_{s(i_j)}\} & \text{if } i_j \notin C \end{cases}$,
-   $C$ is the subcohort, and
-   $J_s$ is a participant randomly selected from $C \cap s$ (where $s$
    is a stratum).

@borgan2000 called this a "swapper" method because of the way $R(t_j)$
is defined for $i_j \notin C$. As shown above, $J_{s(i_j)}$ is removed
from $C$ and $i_j$ is added. If $J_{s(i_j)}$ is not at risk at time
$t_j$, then its removal from $R(t_j)$ makes no difference to the
pseudo-likelihood since $Y_{J_{s(i_j)}} (t_j) = 0$. It is recommended to
use an asymptotic covariance estimator rather than a robust one
[@jiao2001]; see the section
"[8](#sec:Thecalculationofthecovariancematrix)".

@langholz2007 discuss two situations in which a case-cohort study might
be stratified, which they call "exposure stratified" and "confounder
stratified." In the exposure stratified situation, the strata are
defined by levels of one or more covariates, and the purpose of the
stratification is to increase the efficiency of the estimator. In the
confounder stratified situation, the strata are defined by a covariate
that is believed to confound the relation between the exposure of
interest and the event-time (e.g., the center in a multi-center study).
For an exposure stratified study, it is usual to fit a single
unstratified Cox model to the data, and this is is the situation for
which Estimator III was designed. For a confounder stratified study, it
is more natural to fit a stratified Cox model---in which each stratum
$s$ has its own baseline hazard $h_{0s}(t)$ and
$h_i(t) = h_{0s(i)}(t) \exp(\beta^\top z_i)$---and for this, the
estimator of @prentice1986 should be used; but it is still possible to
fit an unstratified model using Estimator III.

# Comparison with other estimators {#sec:Comparisonwithotherestimators}

@borgan2000 described three estimators for the Cox model with data from
a stratified case-cohort study. These have been investigated in several
simulation studies: Borgan et al. used cohorts of size 1000 with
subcohorts of size 100, and found that there was little to choose
between Estimators II and III, but both performed better than Estimator
I; @cologne2012 made similar findings but reported that Estimator III
did slightly better than Estimator II when the sampling fraction was
very small; and @samuelsen2007 found that Estimator II performed well.

Of the three estimators, only Estimator III is score-unbiased. This is
one of the main desirable criteria for estimators for case-cohort data.
It means that the expectation of the pseudo-score (the derivative of the
pseudo-likelihood) is zero when the coefficients take their true values
[@godambe1960; @godambe1976; @lindsay1982; @severini2011; @cologne2012].
On the other hand, Estimator II has smaller asymptotic variance (this
was hinted at in [@borgan2000], stated in [@samuelsen2007], and
explained most clearly in [@samuelsen2006]).

Recall that "Estimator III" refers to the time-fixed version of that
estimator, as calculated by `cchs`. Borgan et al. also described
time-dependent versions of the three estimators, which have smaller
asymptotic variance [@kulich2004]. The time-dependent version of
Estimator III is score-unbiased [@borgan2000], but it is even more
complicated to calculate than the time-fixed version.

Estimator II can be improved using covariate data on the whole cohort,
if that is available [@breslow2009a; @breslow2009b; @yan2017]. The
estimator of @prentice1986 can also be adapted to work with stratified
case-cohort studies. Its pseudo-likelihood is
$$\prod_j \frac{\exp(\beta^\top z_{i_j})}{\sum_{k \in C \cup \{i_j\}}
    Y_k (t_j) \exp(\beta^\top z_k)}.$$
This estimator is only score-unbiased if for $i_j \notin C$ the $C$ in
the above expression is replaced by $(C \cap s(i_j))$. This is less
efficient than Estimator III since the denominator includes fewer
participants.

For stratified case-cohort data it is also possible to use general
methods based on inverse probability weights. These methods are suitable
for a wide range of complex sampling schemes [@mark2006; @lumley2017b],
but no claim is made that the estimators are score-unbiased. This
approach has been used by @gray2009, @liu2012, and @payne2016. In other
research, @kulich2004 presented a framework that covered many
case-cohort estimators and the possibility of stratified
subcohort-selection, and @zeng2007 and @kim2013 described wide classes
of sampling schemes and regression models for survival analysis, of
which the stratified case-cohort design and the Cox model are special
cases.

# How to use `cchs` {#sec:Howtousecchs}

From the user's point of view, `cchs` is reasonably similar to `coxph`.
The most important arguments are:

-   `formula`, which specifies the model (the left-hand side must be a
    `"Surv"` object),
-   `data`, a data frame or environment that contains the variables in
    the formula,
-   `inSubcohort`, an indicator for whether each participant is in the
    subcohort,
-   `stratum`, the stratum variable,
-   `samplingFractions`, the sampling fraction for each stratum,
-   `cohortStratumSizes`, the size of each stratum in the full cohort,
    and
-   `precision`, discussed below.

If the data is supplied as a data frame, it is assumed to be in the
usual form where each row corresponds to one observation (i.e., one
participant in the case-cohort study) and each column corresponds to a
variable. The `inSubcohort` and `stratum` arguments can either be
columns or elements of `data` or separate objects that are named in the
call to `cchs`.

One of `samplingFractions` or `cohortStratumSizes` must be specified,
but not both. If the latter is specified, then `cchs` uses it to
calculate the former---for each stratum, it divides the size of the
subcohort by the size of the cohort, which is given by
`cohortStratumSizes`. If the sampling fractions are not stored as a
column of `data`, then they can be passed to `cchs` as a named vector.
For example, if the stratum variable takes the values `"London"` and
`"Paris"` and the sampling fractions are $0.1$ and $0.2$ respectively,
then this vector should be `c(London = 0.1, Paris = 0.2)`.

The `precision` argument must be set if there are any tied event-times.
Estimator III requires all event-times to be distinct, so `cchs` changes
tied event-times by small amounts, as suggested by @langholz2007, and it
uses `precision` to work out suitable values. If the times are all
integers, then `precision` should be set to $1$. In datasets from
EPIC-InterAct and EPIC-CVD, the times are recorded to the nearest day
but stored as numbers of years, so `precision` should be set to
`1 / 365.25`.

Additional arguments are discussed in
"[10](#sec:Obscureaspectsofthecalculation)".

# An example analysis {#sec:Anexampleanalysis}

`cchsData` is an artificial stratified case-cohort dataset that was
created from the `nwtco` dataset in the *survival* package. The original
`nwtco` data comes from two clinical trials run by the National Wilms
Tumor Study Group in the United States [@dangio1989; @green1998].
Different artificial case-cohort datasets based on `nwtco` have been
used by @kulich2004, @breslow2009a, and @breslow2009b.

In `cchsData`, the event is relapse of Wilms tumor and the
subcohort-selection is stratified by the result of a histological
examination. The most important variables are `time` (the time to the
event or censoring), `isCase` (the event-indicator), `inSubcohort` (the
indicator for being in the subcohort), `localHistol` (the stratum
variable), and `sampFrac` (the stratum-specific sampling fractions). The
times are stored as numbers of days, and some of them are tied, so the
`precision` argument of `cchs` should be set to $1$ (or $1/2$, $1/3$,
etc.).

The sampling fractions in `cchsData` are 5% and 20%. The subcohort is
about half as big as the set of cases. In case-cohort studies in
general, the sampling fraction is typically in the area of 5% but
sometimes larger [@sharp2014], and the subcohort is usually larger than
the set of cases [@juraschek2013; @lamb2013; @jones2015] but
occasionally smaller [@huxley2013].

The following command uses Estimator III to fit a Cox model to
`cchsData`. The covariates are age at diagnosis (`ageAtDiagnosis`) and
stage of cancer at diagnosis (`stage`):

``` r
> cchs(Surv(time, isCase) ~ ageAtDiagnosis + stage, data = cchsData,
+ inSubcohort = inSubcohort, stratum = localHistol, 
+ samplingFractions = sampFrac, precision = 1)
```

The `cchs` function returns an object of S3 class `"cchs"` that contains
many of the same elements as a `"coxph"` object and several additional
elements. When a `"cchs"` object is printed, information about the
dataset and the changes to the tied event-times appears before the
coefficients. The output from the above command is:

``` r
Call: cchs(formula = Surv(time, isCase) ~ stage + ageAtDiagnosis, 
    data = cchsData, inSubcohort = inSubcohort, stratum = localHistol, 
    samplingFractions = sampFrac, precision = 1)
Number of observations/rows: 785, of which
        subcohort non-cases: 214 
        subcohort cases:     48 
        non-subcohort cases: 523 
179 of 571 discretized event-times were changed by up to 0.01 to deal
 with ties. 
Number of strata for subcohort-selection: 2 
Coefficients (HR = hazard ratio, CI = 95% confidence interval, SE = standard 
error):
                     HR   CIlower  CIupper           p     logHR    SElogHR
ageAtDiagnosis 1.101685 1.029489 1.178944 0.005104173 0.09684087 0.03458127

```

This output can be interpreted like output from any other function that
fits the Cox model. For example, the hazard is estimated to be 79%
higher for patients who were at stage III when diagnosed compared to
patients who were at stage I, adjusting for age at diagnosis. The level
for the confidence intervals in the output is determined by the
`confidenceLevel` argument to `cchs`, whose default is $0.95$.

If the output of `cchs` is stored as an object called `result`, then the
coefficients are available as `result$coefficients` and the covariance
matrix is available as `result$var`. The table at the bottom of the
output is stored as `result$coeffsTable` for convenience. For example,
this can be used to get the confidence intervals for the hazard ratio
for `ageAtDiagnosis`:

``` r
> result <- cchs(Surv(time, isCase) ~ ageAtDiagnosis + stage, data = cchsData, 
+ inSubcohort = inSubcohort, stratum = localHistol, 
+ samplingFractions = sampFrac, precision = 1)
> result$coeffsTable["ageAtDiagnosis", c("CIlower", "CIupper")]
```

# Other issues for the user {#sec:Otherissuesfortheuser}

Calling `cchs` twice with the same arguments will not necessarily give
exactly the same results, which is unusual for estimators that maximize
a likelihood or pseudo-likelihood. This happens for two reasons: first,
Estimator III involves randomness in the choice of $J_{s(i_j)}$; and
second, if there are tied event-times, these are changed in a random
way. To get exactly the same results, set the random seed (using
`set.seed`) just before the call to `cchs`.

Another approach would be to call `cchs` multiple times, using the
`replicate` command, then combine the results, perhaps by using Rubin's
rules [@rubin-book; @schafer1999], which are normally used for multiple
imputation. With this approach, for each term in the model the
coefficient estimate is the mean of the separate estimates, and the
variance is the mean of the separate variances plus a term to account
for the between-replication variability. It might be worth expressly
comparing the within-replication variability (the separate variance
estimates) with the between-replication variability (the variability due
to the randomness of the estimator). Figure [1](#fig:replications) shows
the point-estimates and confidence intervals that appear in the previous
section, and the quartiles and ranges of the point-estimates produced by
1000 calls to `cchs` with the same arguments. Here, the
between-replication variability is small, and very small compared to the
within-replication variability.

![Figure 1: The dots and horizontal lines show the point-estimates and
confidence intervals from the output in "[5](#sec:Anexampleanalysis)";
this is within-replication variability. The boxes and whiskers show the
hazard ratios from 1000 replications of `cchs`, using the dataset and
model in the same section; this is between-replication variability. The
boxes show the quartiles and the whiskers show the full
ranges.](fig.png){#fig:replications width="100%"
alt="graphic without alt text"}

In `coxph`, model formulas can contain certain special terms. Of these,
`cchs` allows `offset` terms, but it does not allow `cluster` (for
identifying correlated groups of rows), `strata` (for fitting a
stratified Cox model), or `tt` (for time-varying covariates). If the
data are from a stratified case-cohort study and it is desired to fit a
stratified Cox model where the strata in the baseline hazard are the
same as the strata for the subcohort-selection, then Prentice's
estimator should be used [@langholz2007].

All error and warning messages produced by `cchs` are designed to be
meaningful. This is achieved by checking the arguments and raising an
error if any of them have illegal values, and by adding extra messages
to any errors or warnings raised by `model.frame` or `coxph` when they
are called internally by `cchs`. The addition of the extra messages
results in the call stack, which can be viewed by typing `traceback()`,
being longer and more complicated than usual. Therefore if `traceback()`
is going to be used to diagnose problems, it is advisable to switch the
extra messages off by setting `annotateErrors = FALSE`.

# How `cchs` works {#sec:Howcchsworks}

The `cchs` function works differently from the previously published SAS
and S-Plus code in several ways, and these novel aspects of its
implementation affect the amount of computational time and memory that
it uses and enable it to work with much bigger datasets. They also
affect the numbers in the output. These issues are discussed here for
cautious or curious users who want to know how `cchs` works or compare
it with other software for Estimator III.

Functions that calculate estimators for the Cox model with case-cohort
data invariably work by manipulating the data or the model-formula in
various ways---for example, duplicating rows and changing entry-times,
or appending weights to the rows and including the weight in the
model-formula---and then passing the data and model-formula to a second
model-fitting function (in R, `coxph`) whose original purpose is to fit
the Cox model with the standard estimator. The manipulation is done in
such a way that when the second function attempts to maximize the
partial likelihood, what it actually maximizes is the pseudo-likelihood
for the case-cohort estimator. The second function returns the estimates
of the regression coefficients and their covariance matrix, and the
top-level function usually then makes adjustments to the covariance
matrix.

This method works because the standard partial likelihood and the
various pseudo-likelihoods all have similar forms. They have the same
number of multiplicative terms, one for each case, and the same values
in the numerators (apart from multiplicative factors, which are easy to
deal with). The only differences are the sets of participants who appear
in the denominators and, for some pseudo-likelihoods, multiplicative
factors in the denominators. These sets are dealt with by duplicating or
excluding rows and changing entry- and exit-times, and any
multiplicative factors are dealt with by using an offset term in the
model-formula.

For Estimator III, the manipulations are rather complicated because of
the swapping. The `cchs` function manipulates the data as follows:

Step 1[]{#itm:cchsStep1 label="itm:cchsStep1"}

:   Define a small number $\epsilon$, which is smaller than any of the
    differences between consecutive event-times.

Step 2[]{#itm:cchsStep2 label="itm:cchsStep2"}

:   For each $i_j \notin C$, change the entry-time to $t_j - \epsilon$,
    where $t_j$ is the exit-time.

Step 3[]{#itm:cchsStep3 label="itm:cchsStep3"}

:   For each stratum $s$:

    Step 3.1[]{#itm:cchsStep31 label="itm:cchsStep31"}

    :   Choose a random participant $J_s$ from $C \cap s$. Denote the
        entry-time for $J_s$ by $t_{0s}$ and the exit-time by $t_{1s}$.

    Step 3.2[]{#itm:cchsStep32 label="itm:cchsStep32"}

    :   Let $U_s = \{t_j: i_j \in s, i_j \notin C, t_{0s} < t_j \leq
                  t_{1s} \}$. Sort $U_s$ into increasing order as
        $u_{s(1)},\dots, u_{s(|U_s|)}$.

    Step 3.3[]{#itm:cchsStep33 label="itm:cchsStep33"}

    :   Replace $J_s$'s row by $|U_s|+1$ new rows with variables as
        follows.

        -   Row 1: entry-time $t_{0s}$, exit-time $u_{s(1)}-\epsilon$,
            event-indicator zero.
        -   Row 2: entry-time $u_{s(1)}$, exit-time $u_{s(2)}-\epsilon$,
            event-indicator zero.
        -   ...
        -   Row $|U_s|$: entry-time $u_{s(|U_s|-1)}$, exit-time
            $u_{s(|U_s|)}-\epsilon$, event-indicator zero.
        -   Row $|U_s|+1$: entry-time $u_{s(|U_s|)}$, exit-time
            $t_{1s}$, event-indicator as in the original row.

These steps are best understood by referring to the earlier definition
of $R(t_j)$ and bearing in mind that `coxph` takes a row's at-risk time
to be the half-open interval, (entry-time, exit-time\]. The purpose of
step [1](#itm:cchsStep1) is to choose $\epsilon$ to be sufficiently
small that steps [2](#itm:cchsStep2) and [3](#itm:cchsStep3) do not have
any unintended effects on other terms in the pseudo-likelihood. Step
[2](#itm:cchsStep2) has the effect of removing the non-subcohort cases
from $R(t_j)$, except for $i_j$ itself, which is not removed. Step
[3](#itm:cchsStep3) makes the further changes to $R(t_j)$ that are
needed if $i_j \notin C$. Note that it deals with one $J_s$, not one
$i_j$, at a time. Step [3.1](#itm:cchsStep31) chooses $J_s$. Step
[3.2](#itm:cchsStep32) defines $U_s$ to be the event-times that lie in
the range of $J_s$'s at-risk time and correspond to non-subcohort cases
in $s$. Step [3.3](#itm:cchsStep33) excises a short stretch of at-risk
time from $J_s$ at each time in $U_s$ by splitting $J_s$'s row into
multiple rows with separate stretches of at-risk time.

The effect of step [3](#itm:cchsStep3) is to remove $J_{s(i_j)}$ from
$R(t_j)$ when $i_j \notin C$, as required by the definition of $R(t_j)$.
For a non-subcohort case in $s$ whose event-time is not in $U_s$, it
makes no difference whether $J_{s(i_j)}$ is in $R(t_j)$ or not, because
$Y_{J_{s(i_j)}}(t_j)$ is zero; so for such cases this manipulation is
not necessary.

One other change to the data is needed. An extra column is created that
contains $-\log \alpha_{s(k)}$ for participant $k$, and this is included
as an offset term in the model-formula that `cchs` passes to `coxph`.
This has the effect of inserting the $\alpha_{s(k)} ^ {-1}$ factors that
are needed in the denominators.

# The calculation of the covariance matrix {#sec:Thecalculationofthecovariancematrix}

The `cchs` function uses an asymptotic covariance estimator, as
recommended by @jiao2001. Internally, after it manipulates the data and
calls `coxph`, the final step is to adjust the covariance matrix. This
is done by using the matrix of "dfbeta" residuals, $D$, produced by
`residuals.coxph`; $d_{ij}$ is the change in the estimate of regression
coefficient $j$ when row $i$ is dropped from the data (or an
approximation of that change). The covariance matrix is adjusted by
adding $\sum_s m_s (1 - \alpha_s) \operatorname{Cov} D_{C \cap s}$,
where $m_s=|C \cap s|$, $D_{C \cap s}$ is the rows of $D$ that
correspond to $C \cap s$, and $\operatorname{Cov} D_{C \cap s}$ is the
empirical covariance matrix
$D_{C \cap s}^\top D_{C \cap s} / (m_s - 1)$.

This adjustment corresponds to Equation (17) in @borgan2000. The use of
$D$ is based on the formula for the adjustment to the covariance matrix
with unstratified case-cohort data, which appears on page 102 of
@therneau1999 and as Equation (5) in @langholz2007. There is a small
discrepancy between the formulas in these two publications. To explain
this, let $D_C$ be the rows of $D$ that correspond to $C$ and let
$\alpha = m / n$ be the sampling fraction, where $m$ is the size of the
subcohort and $n$ is the size of the cohort. According to Therneau and
Li, the quantity to add to the covariance matrix is
$(1 - \alpha) D_C^\top D_C$, but according to Langholz and Jiao it is
$\frac{m(n - m)}{n} \operatorname{Cov} D_C=(1-\alpha) \frac{m}{m - 1}
D_C^\top D_C$. These expressions differ by a factor of $m / (m - 1)$,
which is unimportant if $m$ is large, but makes a difference if $m$ is
small. The `cchs` function does the calculation in the same way as
Langholz and Jiao and @cologne2012.

# How the SAS code and S-Plus code work {#sec:HowtheSAScodeandSPluscodework}

The previously published SAS and S-Plus code-fragments for Estimator III
manipulate the data in a completely different way from `cchs`:

Step 1 []{#itm:sasStep1 label="itm:sasStep1"}

:   Define a small number $\epsilon$, which is smaller than any of the
    differences between consecutive event-times.

Step 2 []{#itm:sasStep2 label="itm:sasStep2"}

:   For each $i_j \notin C$, change the entry-time to $t_j - \epsilon$.

Step 3 []{#itm:sasStep3 label="itm:sasStep3"}

:   Replace the dataset with a new dataset that is constructed as
    follows. For each $i_j$:

    Step 3.1 []{#itm:sasStep31 label="itm:sasStep31"}

    :   Make one copy of all the rows.

    Step 3.2 []{#itm:sasStep32 label="itm:sasStep32"}

    :   Drop those of the new rows that are not at risk at $t_j$.

    Step 3.1 []{#itm:sasStep33 label="itm:sasStep33"}

    :   For all rows, set the entry-time to $t_j - \epsilon$ and the
        exit-time to $t_j$, and set the event-indicator to $1$ for $i_j$
        and $0$ for the other rows.

Step 4 []{#itm:sasStep4 label="itm:sasStep4"}

:   For each $i_j \notin C$, choose a random participant $J_{s(i_j)}$
    from $C \cap s(i_j)$ and remove the row that contains $J_{s(i_j)}$
    and has exit-time $t_j$.

Step [3](#itm:sasStep3) radically changes the dataset and greatly
increases its size. The result of the manipulations is that when the
data is passed to `coxph` in S-Plus or `proc phreg` in SAS, each row
corresponds to exactly one additive term in the numerator or denominator
of one multiplicative term of the pseudo-likelihood. The
$\alpha_{s(k)} ^ {-1}$ terms and the adjustment to the covariance matrix
are dealt with in the same way as in `cchs`.

The advantage of this method is that steps [3](#itm:sasStep3) and
[4](#itm:sasStep4) are relatively simple---the "swapping" in step
[4](#itm:sasStep4) just consists of choosing and removing a single row
each time. The disadvantages are that if the original dataset is medium
or large in size then this method uses a gigantic amount of memory and
requires `coxph` to deal with a gigantic dataset. For step
[3.1](#itm:sasStep31), the S-Plus code creates a data frame that
contains one row for every combination of a case and a participant. In
EPIC-CVD, a typical dataset that was supplied to an investigator
contained about $31,000$ participants, of whom $14,000$ were cases, and
this took up about 4.4MB as a binary file. So the data frame created by
step [3](#itm:sasStep3) would have $31,000 \times 14,000 \approx 434$
million rows and take up about 62GB. This is too big for a desktop
computer to store in memory, and even after some rows are removed in
step [4](#itm:sasStep4), the data frame would be far too big for `coxph`
to process in a reasonable amount of time.

In contrast, when `cchs` is used on the same dataset, the manipulated
dataset has fewer than $31,000 + 14,000 = 45,000$ rows. This $45,000$
was calculated by supposing that for every case an extra row is created,
whereas in reality some cases are in the subcohort and it is likely that
some "swapper" rows are not at risk at the relevant event-times, and for
these no extra rows are created, so the true number of rows in the
manipulated dataset is less than $45,000$.

The manipulation of the data by the SAS and S-Plus code can be regarded
as maximal, in the sense that each row ultimately corresponds to a
single additive term in a single multiplicative term of the
pseudo-likelihood. The manipulation by `cchs` can be regarded as
minimal, since it makes only the manipulations that are strictly
necessary in order for `coxph` to calculate the correct
pseudo-likelihood, and it leaves the data with the smallest possible
number of rows.

# Obscure aspects of the calculation {#sec:Obscureaspectsofthecalculation}

Three obscure issues arise in calculating Estimator III. Under normal
circumstances users of `cchs` can ignore these, but for development or
testing it may be necessary to understand these issues or, as described
below, set the relevant logical arguments to different values.

The first issue has to do with the `dropNeverAtRiskRows` argument, which
determines whether rows should be dropped if their at-risk time does not
contain any of the event-times. The dropped rows make no difference to
the regression coefficients output by `cchs`, but they do affect the
covariance-estimates and confidence intervals, because of the
approximation that `residuals.coxph` uses to calculates the dfbeta
residuals. The SAS code and S-Plus code drop these rows (in step
[3.2](#itm:sasStep32)), but @borgan2000 and @langholz2007 make no
mention of this issue. In `cchs`, `dropNeverAtRiskRows` is `TRUE` by
default but can be set to `FALSE` if desired.

The second issue has to do with the `dropSubcohEventsDfbeta` argument.
When the adjustment to the covariance matrix is calculated, the correct
way is to use all the rows of the matrix of dfbeta residuals that
correspond to subcohort members. The SAS code and S-Plus code both omit
the rows that correspond to subcohort cases at their event-times,
presumably because this makes the code simpler and is unlikely to change
the output greatly. By default, `cchs` calculates the adjustment to the
covariance matrix in the strictly correct way. But if
`dropSubcohEventsDfbeta` is `TRUE`, then it calculates the adjustment in
the same way as the SAS and S-Plus code, as follows. For each
$i_j \in C$, it splits that row of the data at $t_j - \epsilon$ and
replaces it with two rows; the first row has entry-time $t_{0i_j}$,
exit-time $t_j - \epsilon$, and event-indicator $0$; and the second row
has entry-time $t_j - \epsilon$, exit-time $t_j$, and event-indicator
$1$. When calculating the adjustment to the covariance matrix, `cchs`
excludes the row of the dfbeta residuals that corresponds to the second
of these two rows.

The third issue is that the "swapper" $J_{s(i_j)}$ is supposed to be
selected once for each stratum (see Section 3 of [@borgan2000]), but the
SAS and S-Plus both select it once for each case. The `cchs` function
selects the swapper correctly. It has no logical argument to specify how
the swapper should be selected, since it manipulates the data in a
completely different way from the SAS and S-Plus code.

# Discussion {#sec:Discussion}

In case-cohort studies, stratified selection of the subcohort seems to
be common [@sharp2014], so there are likely to be plenty of
investigations where `cchs` may be useful. The way in which `cchs`
manipulates the data makes it faster and more computationally efficient
than the previously published SAS and S-Plus code. The three obscure
issues described in the previous section should not greatly affect most
analyses, but will make a difference with small datasets.
