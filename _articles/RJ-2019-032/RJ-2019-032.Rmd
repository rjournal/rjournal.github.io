title: 'roahd Package: Robust Analysis of High Dimensional Data'
abstract: The focus of this paper is on the open-source R package roahd (RObust Analysis
  of High dimensional Data), see Tarabelloni et al. (2017). roahd has been developed
  to gather recently proposed statistical methods that deal with the robust inferential
  analysis of univariate and multivariate functional data. In particular, efficient
  methods for outlier detection and related graphical tools, methods to represent
  and simulate functional data, as well as inferential tools for testing differences
  and dependency among families of curves will be discussed, and the associated functions
  of the package will be described in details.
