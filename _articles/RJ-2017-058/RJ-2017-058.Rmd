title: 'rentrez: An R package for the NCBI eUtils API'
abstract: The USA National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) is one of the
  world’s most important sources of biological information. NCBI databases like PubMed
  and GenBank contain mil lions of records describing bibliographic, genetic, genomic,
  and medical data. Here I present rentrez, a package which provides an R interface
  to 50 NCBI databases. The package is well-documented, contains an extensive suite
  of unit tests and has an active user base. The programmatic interface to the NCBI
  provided by rentrez allows researchers to query databases and download or import
  particular records into R sessions for subsequent analysis. The complete nature
  of the package, its extensive test-suite and the fact the package implements the
  NCBI’s usage policies all make rentrez a powerful aid to developers of new packages
  that perform more specific tasks.
