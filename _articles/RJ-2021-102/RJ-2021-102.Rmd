title: 'spNetwork: A Package for Network Kernel Density Estimation'
abstract: 'This paper introduces the new package spNetwork that provides functions
  to perform Network Kernel Density Estimate analysis (NKDE). This method is an extension
  of the classical Kernel Density Estimate (KDE), a non parametric approach to estimate
  the intensity of a spatial process. More specifically, it adapts the KDE for cases
  when the study area is a network, constraining the location of events (such as accidents
  on roads, leaks in pipes, fish in rivers, etc.). We present and discuss in this
  paper the three main versions of NKDE: simple, discontinuous, and continuous that
  are implemented in spNetwork. We illustrate how to apply the three methods and map
  their results using a sample from a real dataset representing bike accidents in
  a central neighborhood of Montreal. We also describe the optimization techniques
  used to reduce calculation time and investigate their impacts when applying the
  three NKDE to a city-wide dataset.'
