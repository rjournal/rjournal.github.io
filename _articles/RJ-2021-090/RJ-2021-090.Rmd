title: 'An R package for Non-Normal Multivariate Distributions: Simulation and Probability
  Calculations from Multivariate Lomax (Pareto Type II) and Other Related Distributions'
abstract: Convenient and easy-to-use programs are readily available in R to simulate
  data from and probability calculations for several common multivariate distributions
  such as normal and t. However, functions for doing so from other less common multivariate
  distributions, especially those which are asymmetric, are not as readily available,
  either in R or otherwise. We introduce the R package NonNorMvtDist to generate random
  numbers from multivariate Lomax distribution, which constitutes a very flexible
  family of skewed multivariate distributions. Further, by applying certain useful
  properties of multivariate Lomax distribution, multivariate cases of generalized
  Lomax, Mardia’s Pareto of Type I, Logistic, Burr, Cook-Johnson’s uniform, F, and
  inverted beta can be also considered, and random numbers from these distributions
  can be generated. Methods for the probability and the equicoordinate quantile calculations
  for all these distributions are then provided. This work substantially enriches
  the existing R toolbox for nonnormal or nonsymmetric multivariate probability distributions.
