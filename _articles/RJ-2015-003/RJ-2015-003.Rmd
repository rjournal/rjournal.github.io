title: 'sparkTable: Generating Graphical Tables for Websites and Documents with R'
abstract: Visual analysis of data is important to understand the main characteristics,
  main trends and relationships in data sets and it can be used to assess the data
  quality. Using the R package sparkTable, statistical tables holding quantitative
  information can be enhanced by including spark-type graphs such as sparklines and
  sparkbars . These kind of graphics are well-known in literature and are considered
  as simple, intense and illustrative graphs that are small enough to fit in a single
  line. Thus, they can easily enrich tables and texts with additional information
  in a comprehensive visual way. The R package sparkTable uses a clean S4 class design
  and provides methods to create different types of sparkgraphs that can be used in
  websites, presentations and documents. We also implemented an easy way for non-experts
  to create highly complex tables. In this case, graphical parameters can be interactively
  changed, variables can be sorted, graphs can be added and removed in an interactive
  manner. Thereby it is possible to produce custom-tailored graphical tables – standard
  tables that are enriched with graphs – that can be displayed in a browser and exported
  to various formats.
