title: 'htestClust: A Package for Marginal Inference of Clustered Data Under Informative
  Cluster Size'
abstract: ' When observations are collected in/organized into observational units,
  within which observations may be dependent, those observational units are often
  referred to as \"clustered\" and the data as \"clustered data\". Examples of clustered
  data include repeated measures or hierarchical shared association (e.g., individuals
  within families). This paper provides an overview of the R package [htestClust](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=htestClust),
  a tool for the marginal analysis of such clustered data with potentially informative
  cluster and/or group sizes. Contained in htestClust are clustered data analogues
  to the following classical hypothesis tests: rank-sum, signed rank, $t$-, one-way
  ANOVA, F, Levene, Pearson/Spearman/Kendall correlation, proportion, goodness-of-fit,
  independence, and McNemar. Additional functions allow users to visualize and test
  for informative cluster size. This package has an easy-to-use interface mimicking
  that of classical hypothesis-testing functions in the R environment. Various features
  of this package are illustrated through simple examples. '
