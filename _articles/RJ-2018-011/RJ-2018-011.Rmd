title: Approximating the Sum of Independent Non-Identical Binomial Random Variables
abstract: The distribution of the sum of independent non-identical binomial random
  variables is frequently encountered in areas such as genomics, healthcare, and operations
  research. Analytical solutions for the density and distribution are usually cumbersome
  to find and difficult to compute. Several methods have been developed to approximate
  the distribution, among which is the saddlepoint approximation. However, implementation
  of the saddlepoint approximation is non-trivial. In this paper, we implement the
  saddlepoint approximation in the sinib package and provide two examples to illustrate
  its usage. One example uses simulated data while the other uses real-world healthcare
  data. The sinib package addresses the gap between the theory and the implementation
  of approximating the sum of independent non-identical binomials.
