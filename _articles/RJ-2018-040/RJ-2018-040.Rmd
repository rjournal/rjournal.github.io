title: Profile Likelihood Estimation of the Correlation Coefficient in the Presence
  of Left, Right or Interval Censoring and Missing Data
abstract: We discuss implementation of a profile likelihood method for estimating
  a Pearson correla tion coefficient from bivariate data with censoring and/or missing
  values. The method is implemented in an R package clikcorr which calculates maximum
  likelihood estimates of the correlation coefficient when the data are modeled with
  either a Gaussian or a Student t-distribution, in the presence of left, right, or
  interval censored and/or missing data. The R package includes functions for conducting
  inference and also provides graphical functions for visualizing the censored data
  scatter plot and profile log likelihood function. The performance of clikcorr in
  a variety of circumstances is evaluated through extensive simulation studies. We
  illustrate the package using two dioxin exposure datasets.
