title: 'Software Engineering and R Programming: A Call for Research'
abstract: Although R programming has been a part of research since its origins in
  the 1990s, few studies address scientific software development from a Software Engineering
  (SE) perspective. The past few years have seen unparalleled growth in the R community,
  and it is time to push the boundaries of SE research and R programming forwards.
  This paper discusses relevant studies that close this gap Additionally, it proposes
  a set of good practices derived from those findings aiming to act as a call-to-arms
  for both the R and RSE (Research SE) community to explore specific, interdisciplinary
  paths of research.
