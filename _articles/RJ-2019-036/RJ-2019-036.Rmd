title: 'auditor: an R Package for Model-Agnostic Visual Validation and Diagnostics'
abstract: Machine learning models have successfully been applied to challenges in
  applied in biology, medicine, finance, physics, and other fields. With modern software
  it is easy to train even a complex model that fits the training data and results
  in high accuracy on test set. However, problems often arise when models are confronted
  with the real-world data. This paper describes methodology and tools for model-agnostic
  auditing. It provides functinos for assessing and comparing the goodness of fit
  and performance of models. In addition, the package may be used for analysis of
  the similarity of residuals and for identification of outliers and influential observations.
  The examination is carried out by diagnostic scores and visual verification. The
  code presented in this paper are implemented in the auditor package. Its flexible
  and consistent grammar facilitates the validation models of a large class of models.
