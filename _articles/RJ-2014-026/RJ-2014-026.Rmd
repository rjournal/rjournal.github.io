title: 'ngspatial: A Package for Fitting the Centered Autologistic and Sparse Spatial
  Generalized Linear Mixed Models for Areal Data'
abstract: Two important recent advances in areal modeling are the centered autologistic
  model and the sparse spatial generalized linear mixed model (SGLMM), both of which
  are reparameterizations of traditional models. The reparameterizations improve regression
  inference by alleviating spatial confounding, and the sparse SGLMM also greatly
  speeds computing by reducing the dimension of the spatial random effects. Package
  ngspatial (’ng’ = non-Gaussian) provides routines for fitting these new models.
  The package supports composite likelihood and Bayesian inference for the centered
  autologistic model, and Bayesian inference for the sparse SGLMM.
