title: Possible Directions for Improving Dependency Versioning in R
abstract: One of the most powerful features of R is its infrastructure for contributed
  code. The built-in package manager and complementary repositories provide a great
  system for development and exchange of code, and have played an important role in
  the growth of the platform towards the de-facto standard in statistical computing
  that it is today. However, the number of packages on CRAN and other repositories
  has increased beyond what might have been foreseen, and is revealing some limitations
  of the current design. One such problem is the general lack of dependency versioning
  in the infrastructure. This paper explores this problem in greater detail, and suggests
  approaches taken by other open source communities that might work for R as well.
  Three use cases are defined that exemplify the issue, and illustrate how improving
  this aspect of package management could increase reliability while supporting further
  growth of the R community.
