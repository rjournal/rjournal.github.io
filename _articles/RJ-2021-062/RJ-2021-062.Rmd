title: Unidimensional and Multidimensional Methods for Recurrence Quantification Analysis
  with crqa
abstract: Recurrence quantification analysis is a widely used method for characterizing
  patterns in time series. This article presents a comprehensive survey for conducting
  a wide range of recurrence-based analyses to quantify the dynamical structure of
  single and multivariate time series and capture coupling properties underlying leader-follower
  relationships. The basics of recurrence quantification analysis (RQA) and all its
  variants are formally introduced step-by-step from the simplest auto-recurrence
  to the most advanced multivariate case. Importantly, we show how such RQA methods
  can be deployed under a single computational framework in R using a substantially
  renewed version of our crqa 2.0 package. This package includes implementations of
  several recent advances in recurrence-based analysis, among them applications to
  multivariate data and improved entropy calculations for categorical data. We show
  concrete applications of our package to example data, together with a detailed description
  of its functions and some guidelines on their usage.

# Introduction

In the current article, we present the updated 2.0 version of the R
package crqa to perform many variants of recurrence-based analyses
[@coco2014cross], including some very recent developments for the
treatment of multivariate and categorical data. Recurrence-based
techniques allow the quantification of temporal structure and
generalized autocorrelation properties of individual time series
[@webber1994dynamical; @zbilut1992embeddings], the quantification of
bivariate relationships, and coupling between two time series
[@zbilut1998detecting; @marwan2002nonlinear], as well as the
quantification of multidimensional dynamics of multivariate time series
[@wallot2016multidimensional; @wallot2018calculation]. Recurrence-based
techniques originate from the description and analysis of dynamical
systems [@marwan2007recurrence; @marwan2002nonlinear] and have been
widely applied to data from physics
[@alex2015order; @ambrozkiewicz2019dynamical; @donner2007scale; @hilarov2017detection; @zolotova2006phase],
physiology
[@Marwan2002heart; @langbein2004visual; @thomasson2001recurrence; @mestivier2001effects; @monster2016physiological; @timothy2017classification],
and psychology
[@abney2014using; @coco2018performance; @coco2016multilevel; @shockley2003mutual; @wallot2019switching; @wijnants2012interaction; @pagnotta2020attentional],
to name a few fields.

The real success of recurrence-based analyses has revolved around their
power of capturing the dynamics of complex and non-stationary time
series data and of time series exhibiting qualitatively different
patterns along with their temporal evolution [@marwan2007recurrence].
This is because recurrence-based analyses are model-free techniques that
make few assumptions and hence are well suited for the analysis of
complex systems. Moreover, recurrence-based analyses are versatile and
can be applied to interval-scale data as well as nominal data,
continuously sampled data, and inter-event data alike
[@dale2011nominal; @zbilut1998detecting].

The new version of the crqa package features the integration of major
developments in recurrence analysis, such as its extension to
multidimensional data, as well as a key simplification of its design and
a marked improvement of the underlying computational procedures. It
includes useful new functions, including a tool for mining the parameter
settings for continuous data and piece-wise computation of recurrence
plots to mitigate the computational cost of long time series.

The remainder of this article is divided into two broad sections. In the
first section, we provide a concise introduction to the core concepts of
recurrence analysis from the simplest case of auto-recurrence of a
unidimensional time series to the most complex case of multidimensional
cross-recurrence, which is now integrated into the new version of the
crqa package. In the second section, we showcase example applications of
the different analysis methods using empirical data, hence providing a
hands-on tutorial for how to use the different functions of the package.

# Methodological background

In section [2.1](#sec:rqa){reference-type="ref" reference="sec:rqa"}, we
briefly introduce the framework of recurrence quantification analysis
(RQA hereafter) with the simplest case of a unidimensional time series.
Then, in section [2.2](#sec:crqa){reference-type="ref"
reference="sec:crqa"}, we discuss how RQA can be applied to two
different unidimensional times series. Finally, in sections
[2.3](#sec:mdrqa){reference-type="ref" reference="sec:mdrqa"} and
[2.4](#sec:mdcrqa){reference-type="ref" reference="sec:mdcrqa"} we
explain how RQA methods can be extended to multidimensional data.

## Recurrence quantification analysis (RQA) {#sec:rqa}

The concept of recurrence is at the heart of all recurrence-based
analyses [@marwan2002nonlinear; @trulla1996recurrence], which mostly
apply to time series or sequenced data (but see [@wallot2018deriving]).
As we will see, recurrences are often defined in terms of phase space
coordinates, not directly in terms of the values of a single time
series, but the concept is easily demonstrated using this case---a
single time series or sequence---as a starting point. Loosely speaking,
a recurrence is the repetition of a value in a sequence of data points.
More precisely, recurrence in a time series $x$, with $n$ data points
$x_1,x_2,\ldots,x_n$ is defined as:

$$R_{ij} = \left\{
  \begin{array}{lr}
    1 & : x_i = x_j\\
    0 & : x_i \neq x_j
  \end{array}
\right.
\quad
i,j = 1,2, \ldots n$$

The above equation defines the elements $R_{ij}$ of the recurrence
matrix $\mathbf{R}$ in terms of identical repetitions. Such a definition
is useful for a nominal sequence, where there are categorical elements
that are either identical or not, and so no meaningful 'distance' norm
among categories can be defined (see section
[3.3.1](#sec:rqa:data){reference-type="ref" reference="sec:rqa:data"}
for an application to text data). In order to define recurrences for
continuous data, we need to establish a threshold parameter (or radius
parameter) $\varepsilon$, which provides the width of a tolerance band
in the chosen distance norm within which similar but not identical
values in a time series are counted as recurrent:

$$\label{eq:Rij_1d}
    R_{ij} = \left\{
  \begin{array}{lr}
    1 & : \vert x_i - x_j \vert \leq \varepsilon \\
    0 & : \vert x_i - x_j \vert > \varepsilon
  \end{array}
\right.
\quad
i,j = 1,2, \ldots n$$

Setting a threshold is necessary in most cases for empirical data
because such data feature intrinsic fluctuations as well as measurement
error [@marwan2007recurrence]. Using recurrences as defined above, we
can convert any unidimensional time series $x$ into a recurrence plot
(RP), which is a two-dimensional portrait of its dynamics expressed
through its recurrence characteristics.

Figure [1](#fig:examples){reference-type="ref" reference="fig:examples"}
shows some examples of time series of various complexity (i.e., a
sinusoidal, a chaotic attractor, and white noise) and their associated
RPs, given some value for the threshold parameter $\varepsilon$.

![The three-time series in the first row (A) --- a periodical sine wave,
one of the dimensions of the chaotic Lorenz attractor and a white noise
signal --- were subjected to recurrence analysis without dimensional
embedding. That is, the recurrence plots depict recurrences based on the
values of the one-dimensional time series (B). The third row (C) shows
their associated recurrence plots with dimensional embedding (the sine
wave was embedded in 2 dimensions, the Lorenz attractor and the white
noise signal in 3 dimensions).](Figure1_complete.png){#fig:examples
width="\\columnwidth"}

If a time series $x$ constitutes the one-dimensional measurement of an
underlying multidimensional system, and the dynamics of the underlying
dimensions are co-dependent, then these underlying dimensions can be
recovered via the method of time-delayed embedding from the
unidimensional time series [@packard1980geometry; @takens1981detecting].
In these cases, the time series $x$ is delayed (or lagged) by a certain
number of data points, $\tau$, and the number of times such delays are
applied to $x$ depends on an embedding dimension parameter $m$. The
time-shifted copies of $x$, $x_{\tau}$, $x_{2\tau}$,...,$x_{(m-1)\tau}$,
can now be integrated into a single $m$-dimensional phase space, which
shows the recovered multidimensional dynamics behind the measured
unidimensional time series
(Figure [2](#fig:embedding){reference-type="ref"
reference="fig:embedding"}).

![Graphical exemplification of the embedding method. A unidimensional
time series (B)--- here represented with time running along the
y-axis---is embedded in two-dimensional phase space (A) by choosing as
the second dimension (C) of every point in panel B the $\tau$-lagged
value (here $\tau$ = 3) of the very same original unidimensional time
series (B). After selecting an appropriate value of the threshold (or
radius) parameter (here $\varepsilon$ = 0.25), recurrence analysis can
be applied to the trajectory in the two-dimensional phase space (A), and
a recurrence plot is generated (D). In the recurrence plot (D), the
recurrence points around the coordinates of ($X_9$;$X_{9+\tau}$) are
highlighted in red color.](Figure2_complete.png){#fig:embedding
width="\\columnwidth"}

If the time series data comes from a multidimensional system, embedding
the data into a higher dimensional phase space before the computation of
an RP will improve the quantification of the dynamics of the systems
from which that time series was recorded [@marwan2007recurrence]. Now,
with embedded data, recurrences are defined not in terms of the
individual values of the original, unidimensional time series $x$ but in
terms of coordinates in $m$-dimensional phase space. It is possible to
construct a total of $N = n-(m-1)\tau$ points in phase space, with the
following coordinates:

$$\begin{aligned}
    \mathbf{X}_1 &= (x_1, x_{1+\tau}, x_{1+2\tau}, \ldots, x_{1+(m-1)\tau}) \nonumber\\
    \mathbf{X}_2 &= (x_2, x_{2+\tau}, x_{2+2\tau}, \ldots, x_{2+(m-1)\tau}) \nonumber\\
    \vdots& \\
    \mathbf{X}_k &= (x_k, x_{k+\tau}, x_{k+2\tau}, \ldots, x_{k+(m-1)\tau}) \nonumber\\
    \vdots&  \nonumber\\
    \mathbf{X}_N &= (x_N, x_{N+\tau}, x_{N+2\tau}, \ldots, x_{n}) \nonumber\end{aligned}$$

In terms of points in the $m$-dimensional phase space, the elements of
the recurrence matrix are then given by

$$\label{eq:Rij}
    R_{ij} = \left\{
  \begin{array}{lr}
    1 & : \vert\vert \mathbf{X}_i - \mathbf{X}_j \vert\vert \leq \varepsilon \\
    0 & : \vert\vert \mathbf{X}_i - \mathbf{X}_j \vert\vert > \varepsilon
  \end{array}
\right.
\quad
i,j = 1,2, \ldots N$$ where $\vert\vert\cdot\vert\vert$ is a distance
norm in the $m$-dimensional phase space and $\varepsilon$ is the
threshold used to determine whether the points are close enough in phase
space to be considered recurring or not. Examples of embedding and the
resulting RPs are shown in
Figure [1](#fig:examples){reference-type="ref"
reference="fig:examples"}, lower panel, and in
Figure [2](#fig:embedding){reference-type="ref"
reference="fig:embedding"}, panel D. Note, however, that in the process
of phase space reconstruction, the number of coordinates available in
phase space is less than the number of data points in the original time
series, the difference being equal to $n-N = \tau (m-1)$. Moreover, the
resulting phase space portraits do not exactly reflect the true
underlying multidimensional dynamics but are isomorphic to them
[@garland2016exploring]. For continuous time series (i.e., not
categorical), the delay $\tau$, the embedding dimension $m$ and the
radius $\varepsilon$ are usually unknown and have to be estimated from
the data. $\tau$ can be obtained by examining the average mutual
information function (AMI) of $x$ [@fraser1986independent], and the
false-nearest-neighbor function (FNN) of $x$, given some value for
$\tau$, can, in turn, be used to determine $m$ [@kennel1992determining].
The radius $\varepsilon$ is then chosen to achieve the desired
proportion of recurrence points that is expected given the type of data
at hand ([@webber2005recurrence]; see [@wallot2018calculation] for
practical information on parameter estimation). The crqa package
implements functions to carry out parameter estimation
semi-automatically.

RPs are a very useful visualization to qualitatively explore the
dynamics of a time series. However, their main advantage is that they
provide the basis to quantify the dynamics of a time series based on the
patterns of recurrence points found in the plot [@zbilut1992embeddings].
There are various measures that can be computed from RPs. Here, we
briefly describe a selection of measures, including the most common
ones, that are implemented in the new version of the crqa package.

The most basic measure is the recurrence rate (RR) or percentage
recurrence, which is defined as the sum of all recurrence points in an
RP divided by the area of that RP. RR provides a measure for how many
individual values of a time series---or its phase space
coordinates---recur over time:

$$\mathrm{RR} = \frac{1}{N^2} \sum_{i,j=1}^N R_{ij}$$

All other measures characterize dynamics by exploiting the patterns of
recurrences along with the vertical and diagonal structures of the RP
(see Table [\[tab:rqa_summary\]](#tab:rqa_summary){reference-type="ref"
reference="tab:rqa_summary"} for a concise summary of the measures). In
particular, measures based on diagonal-line structures reflect
repetitions of the trajectories of the time series, whereas measures
based on vertical-line structures focus on the states during which a
time series slows down its dynamics. The entropy of the time series can
also be computed on the basis of diagonal and vertical line structures
of the RP. In version 2.0 of the crqa package, we include a novel
entropy measure, which is based on the distribution of the areas of the
rectangular structures in an RP generated from categorical time series.
This measure provides a more accurate estimation of entropy over the
classic diagonal-line entropy for categorical time series that
predominantly evolve in terms of changes of states
[@leonardi2018method].

## Cross-recurrence quantification analysis (CRQA) {#sec:crqa}

Until now, we focused on quantifying the dynamics of a system by way of
recurrences of a single time series. However, the concept of recurrence
can be extended to that of cross-recurrence, which extends the
univariate recurrence analysis to a bivariate analysis technique that
allows quantification of the temporal coupling properties or similarity
of two time series [@zbilut1998detecting; @marwan2007recurrence]. In
other words, cross-recurrence is the recurrence of a value in a time
series $x$, with data points $x_1, x_2, \ldots ,x_n$ with the values of
a time series $y$, with data points $y_1, y_2, \ldots ,y_n$. Formally:

$$\mathrm{CR}_{ij} = \left\{
  \begin{array}{lr}
    1 & : \vert x_i - y_j \vert \leq \varepsilon \\
    0 & : \vert x_i - y_j \vert > \varepsilon
  \end{array}
\right.
\quad
i,j = 1,2, \ldots n$$

As for Equation [\[eq:Rij_1d\]](#eq:Rij_1d){reference-type="ref"
reference="eq:Rij_1d"}, a threshold parameter $\varepsilon$ is applied
to identify similar, but not necessarily identical, values that are
recurrent across the two time series. As in the univariate case, this
parameter can be set to values closer to 0, forcing cross-recurrences to
be identical values, such as between two nominal (categorical)
sequences. Also, in the case of cross-recurrence analysis, the two time
series $x$ and $y$ can be embedded before computing the cross-recurrence
plot (CRP):

$$\mathrm{CR}_{ij} = \left\{
  \begin{array}{lr}
    1 & : \vert\vert \mathbf{X}_i - \mathbf{Y}_j \vert\vert \leq \varepsilon \\
    0 & : \vert\vert \mathbf{X}_i - \mathbf{Y}_j \vert\vert > \varepsilon
  \end{array}
\right.
\quad
i,j = 1,2, \ldots N$$

Commonly, it is expected that $x$ and $y$ have the same number of data
points, and that the delay and embedding dimension parameters, $\tau$
and $m$, have to be the same too (see
[@wallot2018calculation; @wallot2018analyzing] for practical aspects of
parameter estimation)[^1]. The recurrence measures obtained from
cross-recurrence quantification analysis are calculated in the same way
as for the univariate recurrence quantification analysis (see
Table [\[tab:rqa_summary\]](#tab:rqa_summary){reference-type="ref"
reference="tab:rqa_summary"}). However, the values for cross-recurrence
now reflect the coupled dynamics of the two time series
[@Shockley2002coupled] rather than the dynamics of an individual time
series in univariate RQA. There is a key difference between RPs and
CRPs. RPs always have recurrence points all along the main diagonal line
of the plot (so-called line of identity, LOI), because a time series is
by definition recurrent with itself at lag 0, which is what recurrences
along the main diagonal reflect (i.e., $x_i=x_j$ when $i=j$). This is
not necessarily the case for CRPs as two time series are not necessarily
synchronized ($x_i$ need not be the same as $y_j$ when $i=j$). If the
time series are not synchronized, cross-recurrences around the main
diagonal are absent or sparse. The presence of a full LOI in a CRP
implies that the dynamics of the two time series are identical or that
they have a strictly linear relationship to each other.

## Multidimensional recurrence quantification analysis (MdRQA) {#sec:mdrqa}

Multidimensional recurrence quantification analysis (MdRQA) is one of
the recent extensions of RQA [@wallot2016multidimensional] that is now
also available in the crqa package. MdRQA allows the analysis of
multidimensional time series $\mathbf{z}$ with samples
$\mathbf{z}_1, \mathbf{z}_2, \ldots , \mathbf{z}_n$, where each point
(sample) in $\mathbf{z}$ has $d$ dimensions:

$$\mathbf{z}_k = (z_{k,1}, z_{k,2}, \ldots , z_{k,d})$$

Here, recurrences are defined on the $d$-dimensional coordinate space
made up of the points of $\mathbf{z}$:

$$R_{ij} = \left\{
  \begin{array}{lr}
    1 & : \vert\vert \mathbf{z}_i - \mathbf{z}_j \vert\vert \leq \varepsilon \\
    0 & : \vert\vert \mathbf{z}_i - \mathbf{z}_j \vert\vert > \varepsilon
  \end{array}
\right.
\quad
i,j = 1,2, \ldots n$$

Like their unidimensional counterparts, multidimensional time series can
be embedded into a higher dimensional space. The logic of estimating the
delay and embedding dimension parameters, $\tau$ and $m$, are the same
as with univariate RQA [@wallot2017recurrence; @wallot2018analyzing].
However, suppose one has multivariate time series and wants to estimate
embedding parameters for those time series. In that case, one should use
the multivariate embedding functions which are also provided with the
new version of the crqa package, because they provide superior estimates
of embedding parameters for multidimensional time series
[@wallot2018calculation].

Depending on the underlying data, MdRQA can, in principle, be used for
two different purposes. On the one hand, MdRQA can be used to quantify a
multidimensional construct, such as physiological arousal, by
simultaneously looking at its different measurable dimensions (e.g.,
heart rate, breathing, and body temperature). This would be the
multivariate version of how univariate RQA quantifies the dynamics of a
single unidimensional time series (e.g., breathing alone). On the other
hand, MdRQA can be used to examine the shared dynamics of multiple
individual time series, such as, for example, three electrodermal
signals measured from three members of a team performing a collaborative
task. Here, MdRQA variables would be interpreted as capturing
higher-order inter-correlative properties between the three signals at
the level of the group [@wallot2016multidimensional].

In either case, one has to make a decision about whether to normalize
the different dimensions of the time series or not. If each dimension of
the multidimensional time series is normalized, for example, $z$-scored,
it would effectively give each time series equal weight for the
definition of recurrence. In particular, if one does not know how the
different time series interact, or if they are measured on different
scales without regard to their potential effects on one another, then
normalization is recommended. Otherwise, the risk is to assign a greater
weight to the time series bearing greater variance. If one is certain
that the values of each dimension of the multidimensional time series
are already properly scaled with regard to each other, such as when
simultaneously analyzing the three dimensions of the Lorenz system
[@Lorenz1963b], then one needs not---and perhaps should not---normalize
the dimensions.

## Multidimensional cross-recurrence quantification analysis (MdCRQA) {#sec:mdcrqa}

Multidimensional cross-recurrence quantification analysis (MdCRQA)
extends MdRQA in the same way that CRQA extends RQA. Effectively, MdCRQA
allows for the computation of cross-recurrences between two
multidimensional time series $\mathbf{x}$ and $\mathbf{y}$
[@wallot2019multidimensional], where cross-recurrences are defined
between the two $d$-dimensional coordinate spaces between the points of
$\mathbf{x}$ and $\mathbf{y}$:

$$\begin{aligned}
    \mathbf{x}_i &= (z_{i,1}, z_{i,2}, \ldots , z_{i,d}) \\
    \mathbf{y}_j &= (z_{j,1}, z_{j,2}, \ldots , z_{j,d}) \end{aligned}$$

$$\mathrm{CR}_{ij} = \left\{
  \begin{array}{lr}
    1 & : \vert\vert \mathbf{x}_i - \mathbf{y}_j \vert\vert \leq \varepsilon \\
    0 & : \vert\vert \mathbf{x}_i - \mathbf{y}_j \vert\vert > \varepsilon
  \end{array}
\right.
\quad
i,j = 1,2, \ldots n$$

It is important that the different dimensions of the two multivariate
time series enter the analysis in the same order. For the example of
physiological arousal, if the heart rate is the first dimension in
$\mathbf{x}$, breathing is the second dimension in $\mathbf{x}$, and
body temperature is the third dimension in $\mathbf{x}$, then heart rate
also needs to be the first dimension in $\mathbf{y}$, breathing needs to
be the second dimension in $\mathbf{y}$, and accordingly body
temperature needs to be the third dimension in $\mathbf{y}$. Otherwise,
the resulting MdCRQA measure will not be interpretable.

Unidimensional and multidimensional cross-recurrence analysis can also
be performed in a time-dependent manner. This so-called windowed
cross-recurrence analysis is conceptually very similar to windowed
cross-correlation analysis as in @boker2002windowed, and it can be used
to track how cross-recurrence changes over the time course. To that end,
one simply partitions the time series of interest into a number of
overlapping or non-overlapping sub-series and calculates CRPs for each
of the sub-series. For each CRP, i.e., each sub-series of the original
time series, the recurrence measures are calculated, which allows
tracking changes in cross-recurrence over time.

## The diagonal cross-recurrence profile (DCRP) {#sec:drp}

Finally, from cross-recurrence plots of either two unidimensional time
series (i.e., CRQA) or two multidimensional time series (i.e., MdCRQA),
it is possible to extract the diagonal cross-recurrence profiles (DCRPs)
and use them to capture leader-follower-relationships
[@dale2011nominal; @marwan2007recurrence]. To that end, one has to
specify a window size $w$ for the number of lags on the recurrence plot
that one wants to investigate. For example, a window-size of 10
data-points, i.e., $w = 10$ would span recurrences of $\pm$ 10 diagonals
from the LOI. Specifically, this procedure determines the
cross-recurrence rates of each diagonal, $\mathrm{CR}_w$, by summing up
all cross-recurrence points that fall along such diagonal and divide
them by their length:

$$\mathrm{CR}_{w} = \frac{1}{N - w} \sum_{j-i=w}^{N-w} R_{i,j}$$

The DCRP permits quantification of the recurrence rate over different
relative lags between two time series. If the peak of cross-recurrences
falls along the central diagonal, the line of synchronization (LOS),
then this suggests strong coupling at lag 0 between the two time series.
If the peak of cross-recurrences falls instead on one of the diagonals
off the LOS, it indicates that the dynamics of one time series follow
the dynamics of the other time series by some lag equal to that diagonal
position (Figure [3](#fig:dcrp){reference-type="ref"
reference="fig:dcrp"}).

Note, however, interpreting the lags in terms of the sampling rate of
the underlying measured time series only applies to CRPs based on
unembedded (often categorical) time series. If the time series are
embedded, this means that the observed lag is based on coordinates that
are made up of several data points from the respective original time
series, and hence introduces a degree of uncertainty with regard to the
precise time interval of the lag when one tries to map particular
recurrence points back to data points of the original time series. In
addition, the leader-follower interpretation of the lags cannot be
granted the status of a causal interpretation. For example, a parent can
deliberately 'lag' their behavior behind that of their child. In such a
case, it would be odd to say definitively that the child's behavior is
causing the parent's behavior. For this reason, the DCRP has to be
interpreted with caution and is best treated as a general description of
relative temporal relationships.

computation of their CRP, one can define their diagonal cross-recurrence
profile (DCRP) in order to quantify their time-lagged coupling
properties (B). As can be seen, the two time series are most strongly
coupled at around the lags of 5 to 9, where a peak in the DCRP can be
observed.](Figure3_complete.png){#fig:dcrp width="\\columnwidth"}

(CRAN) at <https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/crqa/index.html>. The
software is written in R with the exception of the spdiags function,
which contains a section written in Fortran. The main function is crqa,
which takes its name from the package. This function performs all types
of recurrence quantification analyses discussed in the previous section,
and it returns the actual recurrence plot, along with the measures
listed in
Table [\[tab:rqa_summary\]](#tab:rqa_summary){reference-type="ref"
reference="tab:rqa_summary"} extracted from it. Here is how to call this
primary function, with arguments and defaults:

::: example
crqa(ts1, ts2, delay, embed, rescale = 0, radius, normalize = 0,
mindiagline = 2, minvertline = 2, tw = 0, whiteline = FALSE, recpt =
NULL, side = \"upper\", method = \"crqa\", metric = \"euclidean\",
datatype = \"continuous\")
:::

Several arguments in this function allow the user to refine aspects of
the computation. For example, the user can modify the metric to obtain
the distance matrix when estimating recurrence or the settings of
thresholds to accept contiguous points as recurring (see
Table [\[tab:crqa:arguments\]](#tab:crqa:arguments){reference-type="ref"
reference="tab:crqa:arguments"} for the list of arguments of crqa with a
brief explanation of each). drpfromts can be used to obtain the diagonal
cross-recurrence profile, and this function is built using the crqa at
its core. In fact, most arguments stay exactly the same, and we will
illustrate the additional arguments that are specific to this function
when describing it. Likewise, the functions wincrqa and windowdrp are
built on the main function crqa and are used to compute windowed
cross-recurrence. The package also contains functions, such as
optimizeParam, to automatically estimate the settings for the three main
parameters of RQA analyses, i.e., radius $\varepsilon$, delay $\tau$,
and embedding dimension $m$, for continuous measures. As recurrence
quantification analysis is heavy on memory requirements, the package
features a function ( piecewiseRQA) which can be used to break down the
analysis of long time series into smaller and more manageable chunks
that are computationally more tractable. Finally, the package provides
the user with functions to simulate data from classic examples of
dynamical systems, such as the Lorenz ( lorenzattractor) or categorical
series with different distributions ( simts). In what follows, we
briefly describe the data available with the package. These data are
used to illustrate the different functionalities of the crqa package.

## Related Packages

A search of CRAN shows very few other packages offering alternative
methods to compute recurrence quantification analysis. In particular,
[tseriesChaos](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=tseriesChaos),
[nonlinearTseries](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=nonlinearTseries),
and [RHRV](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=RHRV). The function recurr
in [tseriesChaos](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=tseriesChaos)
computes a recurrence plot for a (section of) a single unidimensional
time series, but it does not compute any derived measures from the plot
characterizing the dynamics of the system, nor does it handle cross
recurrence plots or any of the many extensions to simple recurrence
plots provided by our [crqa](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=crqa)
package. Going a little further, the function rqa in
[nonlinearTseries](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=nonlinearTseries)
returns key measures from the recurrence plots (e.g., recurrence rate)
and quick visualization of the recurrence plot (available also with the
function RecurrencePlot). Finally, the function RecurrencePlot in
[RHRV](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=RHRV) is simply a wrapper
built on the function in
[nonlinearTseries](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=nonlinearTseries)
with the same name but specifically tailored to electrocardiogram data.
The functions available in
[nonlinearTseries](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=nonlinearTseries)
provide very basic functionality in terms of the range of metrics
available and optimization routines. They do not allow the user to
examine diagonal structures for leader-follower analyses, nor explore
the evolution of recurrence rate using windowed methods. All such
features are integrated into crqa, which, to the best of our knowledge,
is the most comprehensive statistical package to perform recurrence
quantification analysis in R.

## Data {#sec:data}

Different types of categorical and continuous time series, both
unidimensional and multidimensional, are available with the package. The
command load(crqa) will load the data into the R workspace. In
particular, we include a nursery rhyme "The wheels on the bus" by Verna
Hills to illustrate the most basic recurrence quantification analysis.
This text is a vector of 120 strings (i.e., the words of the song), and
as it is extremely simple and highly repetitive, it makes it a very good
example to illustrate the core concept of recurrence. Then, we move on
to cross-recurrence quantification analysis and include in the data
object of the package eye-tracking data from the study by
[@richardson2005looking]. In this study, a narrator describes the
characters of a TV series (Friends) to a listener, who will have to
later answer some comprehension questions about them, while their
eye-movement is co-registered. Here, we use a single trial of this
study, which is stored as a data frame of 2,000 observations of six
possible screen locations that are looked at by the narrator and the
listener. These are numerically coded from 1 to 6, representing a 2x3
visual grid[^2]. This data will also be used to illustrate diagonal and
windowed cross-recurrence. Finally, we illustrate multidimensional
cross-recurrence analysis using the hand movement data from the study by
[@wallot2016beyond]. In this study, dyads were instructed to cooperate
in a complex LEGO joint construction task under different conditions,
while their hand movements and heart rates were co-registered. Again, we
select only a single trial of hand-movement from the turn-taking
condition. The data frame comprises 5,799 observations from two
participants (P1 and P2) for the dominant (\_d) and non-dominant (\_n)
hand.

## Using the crqa package

### RQA {#sec:rqa:data}

As explained in section [2.1](#sec:rqa){reference-type="ref"
reference="sec:rqa"}, RQA entails computing the auto-recurrence of a
unidimensional time series. In the context of the nursery rhyme, we
expect clear phases of recurrence to emerge because the words greatly
repeat. In order to run this analysis, we use the main function crqa and
specify in the argument method that we are running an RQA analysis (
method = \"rqa\"). As the data that we use is categorical, we need to
specify in the argument datatype that the nature of the data is
categorical ( datatype = \"categorical\"). This will automatically
recode the categorical states of the series (i.e., the words) into
unique numerical integers so that recurrence can be computed using a
radius that has to be smaller than 1 (e.g., radius = 0.01) so that we
can capture the recurrence of identical words. For categorical RQA, the
delay and embedding dimension have to be set to 1 ( delay = 1; embed =
1[^3].). We also need to set the Theiler window parameter to 1 ( tw = 1)
so that we can exclude the LOI from all recurrence measures. Finally,
the same unidimensional time series has to be input both as ts1 and ts2
to obtain its auto-recurrence.

::: example
res \<- crqa(text, text, delay = 1, embed = 1, rescale, radius = 0.01,
normalize, mindiagline, minvertline, tw = 1, whiteline, recpt, side,
method = \"rqa\", metric = \"euclidean\", datatype = \"categorical\")
:::

We can use the plotting function plotRP to visualize the resulting
recurrence plot. This function provides some basic arguments to change
the size of the points in the plot ( pcex), the color ( cols), or their
type ( pch), which are taken verbatim from the generic plot function.

::: example
RP \<- res$RP
parC <- list(unit = 10, labelx = "Time", labely = "Time", cols = "black", pcex = .5,
             pch = 15, las = 0, labax = seq(0, nrow(RP), 10),
             labay = seq(0, nrow(RP), 10))
plotRP(RP, parC)
\end{example}

In order to get a closer understanding of recurrences, we zoom in into a segment of the text, re-run the \texorpdfstring%
{{\normalfont\ttfamily\hyphenchar\font=-1 crqa()}}%
{crqa()} function, and visualize it (Figure~\ref{fig_rqa_text}). We add the labels of the axes (x,y), print the words vertically using the \texorpdfstring%
{{\normalfont\ttfamily\hyphenchar\font=-1 las}}%
{las} argument, and decrease the temporal \texorpdfstring%
{{\normalfont\ttfamily\hyphenchar\font=-1 unit}}%
{unit} argument to print each individual word on the axes.

\begin{example}
text_zoom <- text[81:110]
ans_zoom <- crqa(text_zoom, text_zoom, delay, embed, rescale, radius, normalize, 
                 mindiagline, minvertline, tw, whiteline, recpt, side, method, metric, 
                 datatype)
RP <- ans_zoom$RP parC$labay <- parC$labax \<- text_zoom parC$las <- 2
parC$unit \<- 1 parC$labelx <- parC$labely \<- \"Words\" plotRP(RP,
parC)
:::

![Recurrence quantification of the nursery rhyme 'wheels on the bus'. On
the left panel, we show the full recurrence and the red box indicates
the region of RP that is zoomed in on the right
panel.](Figure4_complete.png){#fig_rqa_text width="\\columnwidth"}

As it can be clearly seen in
Figure [4](#fig_rqa_text){reference-type="ref"
reference="fig_rqa_text"}, the bulk of recurrence in that portion is
driven by the repeated use of the single word *wah*. When looking at a
few measures associated with the RP, we observe an overall determinism
of 85.4%, which implies that the system is fairly repetitive, an average
diagonal line length of 3.88, which implies that on average, there are
sequences of four words that repeat, and a maximum diagonal length of 9,
which means that the longest sequence repeating is made of 9 words. Some
measures such as determinism or the average diagonal line length
depending on the setting of the argument mindiagline (equivalent to
$l_\text{min}$ in
Table [\[tab:rqa_summary\]](#tab:rqa_summary){reference-type="ref"
reference="tab:rqa_summary"}). The default value of this argument is 2,
as two contiguous points form a line, but it can depend on the type of
data (e.g., words vs. eye-movement) or the sample rate at which it is
acquired (55 Hz vs. 1,000 Hz). For example, if we have acquired data at
1,000 Hz, we would practically have one data point every 2 ms. This
means that if we use a default mindiagline of 2, we would be considering
as lines any states that contiguously repeat over a 4 ms window. This
value would certainly be unrealistic for some type of responses that
unfolds over a longer period of time (e.g., an eye-movement fixation
lasts for an average of 200 ms).

### CRQA: crqa

As already explained in section [2.2](#sec:crqa){reference-type="ref"
reference="sec:crqa"}, cross-recurrence is an extension of
auto-recurrence to two different unidimensional time series. In order to
run a cross-recurrence analysis with the crqa package, we simply need to
change the method argument to method = \"crqa\". Here, we illustrate its
use through two time series of eye-movement data explained in section
[3.2](#sec:data){reference-type="ref" reference="sec:data"}. Also, we
input two different time series of eye-movement data, narrator and
listener, rather than just one. An optional argument that is available
in the crqa function is the side (upper, lower, or both) of the
recurrence plot on which recurrence measures are computed. This may be
useful, for example, for researchers interested in leader-follower
dynamics (see Figure [5](#fig:crqaeye){reference-type="ref"
reference="fig:crqaeye"}, left panel, for the visualization of the
cross-recurrence plot).

![Cross-recurrence using a single trial of eye-movement data measured on
a listener and a narrator. On the left panel, we visualize the full
cross-recurrence plot. The transparent red band represents the lags
around the line of coincidence that have been used to calculate the
diagonal cross-recurrence plot (center panel), whereas the transparent
blue squares within it are the overlapping windows used to compute the
windowed cross-recurrence profile (right
panel).](Figure5_complete.png){#fig:crqaeye width="\\columnwidth"}

### Diagonal-CRQA: drpfromts

In section [2.2](#sec:crqa){reference-type="ref" reference="sec:crqa"},
we explained what diagonal cross-recurrence is and how it can be used.
In the crqa package, this measure is computed by the function drpfromts,
which utilizes the same arguments of the main crqa function plus an
additional argument, windowsize, to define the number of lags (or
diagonals) around the line of synchronization (LOS) of the CRP over
which recurrence rate is computed. In the example visualized in
Figure [5](#fig:crqaeye){reference-type="ref" reference="fig:crqaeye"},
center panel, we have chosen a window of 100 lags, which spans about
$\pm 3$ seconds around the LOS. We can clearly see that the peak
recurrence is shifted by $\approx 1$ second from the LOS, i.e., lag 0.
This reflects the time taken by the listener to look at the same panel
the narrator was looking at---namely, about 1 second for a listener to
"catch up" to the speaker.

::: example
res \<- drpfromts(narrator, listener, windowsize = 100, radius = 0.001,
delay = 1, embed = 1, rescale = 0, normalize = 0, mindiagline = 2,
minvertline = 2, tw = 0, whiteline = F, recpt = F, side = \"both\",
method = \"crqa\", metric = \"euclidean\", datatype = \"continuous\")
:::

### Windowed-CRQA: windowdrp

Windowed cross-recurrence captures the evolution of recurrence rate over
time. In the context of the eye-movement data, this measure reflects how
consistently listener and narrator are looking at the same scene
location at any given point in time. More importantly, the windowed
methodology reveals how recurrence changes over time (refer to
section [2.5](#sec:drp){reference-type="ref" reference="sec:drp"} for
more details). We use the function windowdrp to compute this measure,
which again shares the same arguments of crqa, plus three more that are
specific to it. In particular, we have to set: (a) the size of the
window that slides over the time-course, e.g., windowsize = 100, (b) the
step that we want this window to move, e.g., windowstep = 20, and (c)
the number of lags[^4] within the window of interest over which
recurrence rate is computed, e.g., lagwidth = 50. In
Figure [5](#fig:crqaeye){reference-type="ref" reference="fig:crqaeye"},
right panel, we observe that the recurrence rate grows over time, which
means that the narrator and the listener tend to look more and more at
the same panels as the trial progresses.

::: example
res \<- windowdrp(narrator, listener, windowstep = 20, windowsize = 100,
lagwidth = 50, radius = 0.001, delay = 1, embed = 1, rescale = 0,
normalize = 0, mindiagline = 2, minvertline = 2, tw = 0, whiteline = F,
side = \"both\", method = \"crqa\", metric = \"euclidean\", datatype =
\"continuous\")
:::

## MdCRQA

Finally, we compute multidimensional cross-recurrence by setting the
method argument, i.e., method = \"mdcrqa\". Note, in order to compute
multidimensional recurrence, the user needs to provide the same data
frame as input to both ts1 and ts2. This method is also available for
drpfromts and windowdrp. Applied to the hand movement data, we first
restructure the data of the two participants into independent sets. We
re-use the same parameter settings of [@wallot2016beyond] to compute
MdCRQA and leave all other arguments with their default values.

::: example
P1 \<- cbind(handset$P1_TT_d, handset$P1_TT_n) P2 \<-
cbind(handset$P2_TT_d, handset$P2_TT_n) res \<- crqa(P1, P2, delay = 5,
embed = 2, rescale = 0, radius = 0.1, normalize = 0, mindiagline = 10,
minvertline = 10, tw = 0, whiteline, recpt, side, method = \"mdcrqa\",
metric, datatype)
:::

## Breaking down the computation: piecewiseRQA

Often, researchers are interested in time series which contain several
thousands of observations. Sometimes the dimensionality of these time
series can be reduced without losing too much information, such as by
down-sampling. This strategy may not always be possible or serve the
researcher's purpose. Recurrence quantification analysis can require
more RAM than is available in standard laptops or personal workstations,
making it nearly impossible to run. In the new version of the crqa
package, we provide the user with the piecewiseRQA function, which can
be used to compute all different variants of recurrence quantification
analysis described above on long time series. Conceptually, this
function divides the time series into blocks, obtains a recurrence plot
for each individual block, and then fills the original recurrence plot
with all such sub-blocks, before computing the measures.[^5]

For example, if we are handling a time series of 10,000 observations, we
could divide it into 10 blocks of 1,000 observations each. piecewiseRQA
has exactly the same arguments that we have already encountered in the
main crqa function but has an additional two that are used to control
the size of the block, e.g., blockSize = 100, and the argument typeRQA,
which can take two options, either full or diagonal. If the value for
typeRQA is diagonal, only the diagonal cross-recurrence will be
computed; if full, the recurrence measures will be obtained out of the
full plot[^6]. In Figure [6](#fig:performance){reference-type="ref"
reference="fig:performance"}, we visualize the computational speed (left
panel) and memory demand (right panel) on simulated time series of
sinusoids of increasing size and compare what happens if we run the
piecewiseRQA, also with blocks of increasing size, as compared to
running the main crqa function. We can clearly see that for time series
of increasing length, memory demands are kept lower by the piecewiseRQA
function as compared to the crqa. However, we can also see that there is
a wide variance for blocks of different sizes. Therefore, it may be wise
to explore the block sizes to find the one that can optimize the
computational performance over a single trial before running the
piecewise recurrence analysis on an entire dataset.

![Evaluating the speed (time in seconds, left panel) and memory (peak
RAM in MB, right panel) performance of crqa() and piecewiseRQA() for
simulated data of increasing size (from 3000 to 7000 data points). We
compare the use of blocks of different sizes (from 1000 to 6500 in
increments of 500, coded using color and point type) with the case of
running crqa() on the entire sequence of data
points.](Figure6_complete.png){#fig:performance width="\\columnwidth"}

## Estimating starting parameters: optimizeParam

The last function we showcase is optimizeParam, which helps the user
exploring the space of values for the parameters of delay, embedding
dimension and radius to compute recurrence quantification on
continuous-valued time series. In particular, optimizeParam first
estimates the average mutual information (AMI) of either the
unidimensional or multidimensional time series and chooses the value
that minimizes it. Then, it takes such a delay value and evaluates the
embedding dimensions maximizing the false-nearest neighbors (FNN)[^7].
As a last step, optimizeParam applies the values of delay and embedding
dimension obtained to find a radius which returns a recurrence rate
within a minimum and maximum value established by the user. We apply
optimizeParam() to simulated sinusoids to show the unidimensional case,
and to the hand movement data of [@wallot2016beyond] to show the
multidimensional case.

In order to set up the estimation of the delay and embedding dimensions
for unidimensional time series, the user has to decide how to choose the
value of average mutual information (i.e., typeami = mindip, the lag at
which minimal information is observed, or typeami = maxlag, the maximum
lag at which minimal information is observed) and the relative
percentage of information gained in FNN, relative to the first embedding
dimension, when higher embeddings are considered (i.e., fnnpercent).
Then, as crqa is integrated into the optimizeParam to estimate the
radius, most of the arguments are the same (e.g., mindiagline or tw),
except the number of values of that are considered (i.e., radiusspan =
100).

::: example
ts1 \<- seq(0.1, 200, .1) ts1 \<- sin(ts1) + linspace(0, 1,length(ts1))
ts2 \<- ts1 par \<- list(method = \"rqa\", metric = \"euclidean\",
maxlag = 20, radiusspan = 100, normalize = 0, rescale = 4, mindiagline =
10, minvertline = 10, tw = 0, whiteline = FALSE, recpt = FALSE, side =
\"both\", datatype = \"continuous\", fnnpercent = 10, typeami =
\"mindip\") results \<- optimizeParam(ts1, ts2, par, min.rec = 2,
max.rec = 5) print(unlist(results))

radius emddim delay 0.17 2 18
:::

For multidimensional series, the user needs to specify the right RQA
method (i.e., method = \"mdcrqa\"). Then, for the estimation of the
delay via AMI: (1) nbins, which is the number of breaks used to define
the bins within which the two-dimensional histogram (or frequency
distribution) of the original and delayed time series are computed, and
(2) the criterion to select the delay ( firstBelow to use the lowest
delay at which the AMI function drops below the value set by the
threshold argument, and localMin to use the position of the first local
AMI minimum). The estimation of the embedding dimensions instead needs
the following arguments: (1) maxEmb, which is the maximum number of
embedding dimensions considered, (2) noSamples, which is the number of
randomly drawn coordinates from phase space used to estimate the
percentage of false-nearest neighbors, (3) Rtol, which is the first
distance criterion for separating false neighbors, and (4) Atol, which
is the second distance criterion for separating false neighbors. The
radius is estimated as before.

::: example
par$method <- "mdcrqa"
par$nbins \<- 50 par$criterion <- "firstBelow"
par$threshold \<- 1.6 par$maxEmb <- 20
par$numSamples \<- 500 par$Rtol <- 10
par$Atol \<- 2 results \<- optimizeParam(P1, P2, par, min.rec = 2,
max.rec = 5) print(unlist(results))

radius emddim delay 0.032 11 2

# Conclusion

This paper describes recurrence quantification analysis, a statistical
method to characterize the nonlinear dynamics of a system. It has
received a growing interest from researchers across very different
fields from physiology to psychology because of its flexibility, ease of
application, and explanatory power. In particular, we explain recurrence
analysis from the simplest case of auto-recurrence of a unidimensional
time series to the most complex case of multidimensional
cross-recurrence. More importantly, we presented a significantly updated
version of the crqa to perform all different variants of recurrence
analysis described in the theoretical section of this manuscript. We
showcased the different functions available in crqa with real data of
categorical and continuous nature, and illustrated how starting
parameters for continuous data could be obtained (i.e., radius,
embedding dimension, and delay) as well as handling long time series in
a memory-efficient way using additional functions available in crqa.

It is useful to end with some observations regarding the broader
relevance of the package presented here. The RQA methodology and the
updated crqa tap into a number of evolving problems in data analysis
across various disciplines. For example, there is a drive to improve
measures and models of multimodal data
[@abawajy2015comprehensive; @dale2015integrative; @lahat2015multimodal],
including multi-person measures
[@cooke2013interactive; @lopez2017combining; @schilbach2013toward; @von2016verbal; @wallot2016beyond].
RQA and its multidimensional counterpart implemented in our package
constitute an extraordinarily expansive analysis tool for exploring
varied kinds of complex and multidimensional data. In addition, a demand
for more dynamic quantitative analyses has now also penetrated into the
social sciences
[@chemero2011radical; @friedenberg2009dynamical; @spivey2008continuity; @ward2002dynamical; @pagnotta2020attentional].
**crqa** is designed to be a comprehensive analysis package for studying
the dynamics of diverse systems, especially systems that exhibit high
degrees of interdependence, and that show signatures in their dynamics
that are critical for understanding them.

[^1]: It is possible for $x$ and $y$ to be different lengths, and so to
    produce a rectangular CRP, but this is very rare in practice and it
    introduces some complications in computing synchrony measures

[^2]: There are two more states, 10 and 11, to indicate when the
    listener or the narrator blinked or looked outside of the screen or
    to identify possible blinks. They are coded with a different number
    so that these two states will not recur when the radius is set near
    0.

[^3]: If embedding dimension is set to higher values, this becomes
    equivalent to doing recurrence on $n$-grams, where $m=n$. In fact,
    this interpretation of categorical recurrence creates bridges to
    traditional natural language processing, summarized in
    [@dale2018dynamic]

[^4]: Note, that the number of lags cannot be greater than the size of
    the window.

[^6]: Currently, the windowed cross-recurrence is not implemented to
    work with the piecewiseRQA.
