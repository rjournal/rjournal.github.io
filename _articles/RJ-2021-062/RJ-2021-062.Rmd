title: Unidimensional and Multidimensional Methods for Recurrence Quantification Analysis
  with crqa
abstract: Recurrence quantification analysis is a widely used method for characterizing
  patterns in time series. This article presents a comprehensive survey for conducting
  a wide range of recurrence-based analyses to quantify the dynamical structure of
  single and multivariate time series and capture coupling properties underlying leader-follower
  relationships. The basics of recurrence quantification analysis (RQA) and all its
  variants are formally introduced step-by-step from the simplest auto-recurrence
  to the most advanced multivariate case. Importantly, we show how such RQA methods
  can be deployed under a single computational framework in R using a substantially
  renewed version of our crqa 2.0 package. This package includes implementations of
  several recent advances in recurrence-based analysis, among them applications to
  multivariate data and improved entropy calculations for categorical data. We show
  concrete applications of our package to example data, together with a detailed description
  of its functions and some guidelines on their usage.
