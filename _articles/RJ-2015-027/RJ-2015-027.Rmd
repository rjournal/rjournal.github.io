title: 'Working with Multilabel Datasets in R: The mldr Package'
abstract: Most classification algorithms deal with datasets which have a set of input
  features, the variables to be used as predictors, and only one output class, the
  variable to be predicted. However, in late years many scenarios in which the classifier
  has to work with several outputs have come to life. Automatic labeling of text documents,
  image annotation or protein classification are among them. Multilabel datasets are
  the product of these new needs, and they have many specific traits. The mldr package
  allows the user to load datasets of this kind, obtain their characteristics, produce
  specialized plots, and manipulate them. The goal is to provide the exploratory tools
  needed to analyze multilabel datasets, as well as the transformation and manipulation
  functions that will make possible to apply binary and multiclass classification
  models to this data or the development of new multilabel classifiers. Thanks to
  its integrated user interface, the exploratory functions will be available even
  to non-specialized R users.
