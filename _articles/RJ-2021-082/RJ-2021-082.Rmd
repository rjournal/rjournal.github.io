title: 'miRecSurv Package: Prentice-Williams-Peterson Models with Multiple Imputation
  of Unknown Number of Previous Episodes'
abstract: Left censoring can occur with relative frequency when analyzing recurrent
  events in epi demiological studies, especially observational ones. Concretely, the
  inclusion of individuals that were already at risk before the effective initiation
  in a cohort study may cause the unawareness of prior episodes that have already
  been experienced, and this will easily lead to biased and inefficient estimates.
  The miRecSurv package is based on the use of models with specific baseline hazard,
  with multiple imputation of the number of prior episodes when unknown by means of
  the COMPoisson distribution, a very flexible count distribution that can handle
  over, sub, and equidispersion, with a stratified model depending on whether the
  individual had or had not previously been at risk, and the use of a frailty term.
  The usage of the package is illustrated by means of a real data example based on
  an occupational cohort study and a simulation study.
