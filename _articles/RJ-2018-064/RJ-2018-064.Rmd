title: Downside Risk Evaluation with the R Package GAS
abstract: 'Financial risk managers routinely use non--linear time series models to
  predict the downside risk of the capital under management. They also need to evaluate
  the adequacy of their model using so--called backtesting procedures. The latter
  involve hypothesis testing and evaluation of loss functions. This paper shows how
  the R package *GAS* can be used for both the dynamic prediction and the evaluation
  of downside risk. Emphasis is given to the two key financial downside risk measures:
  Value-at-Risk (VaR) and Expected Shortfall (ES). High-level functions for: (i) prediction,
  (ii) backtesting, and (iii) model comparison are discussed, and code examples are
  provided. An illustration using the series of log--returns of the Dow Jones Industrial
  Average constituents is reported.'

# Introduction

The [*GAS*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=GAS) package of @GAS
provides a complete framework for modeling, estimating and predicting
time series processes for which the time variation in the parameters is
driven by the score of the conditional density function. This
increasingly popular class of score-driven models has been introduced by
@creal_etal.2013 and @harvey.2013. @ardia_etal.2019 describe the general
functionality implemented in the *GAS* package, but do not cover the
functionality useful for the estimation and backtesting of Value-at-Risk
(VaR) and Expected Shortfall (ES), which are the two leading risk
measures used in finance. The aim of this paper is to show how the
functions available in the *GAS* package can be used for VaR and ES
evaluation, prediction, and backtesting.

The economic relevance of this topic follows partly from the Basel
Accords (currently the Basel III Accords), which impose that banks and
financial institutions have to meet capital requirements, and must rely
on state-of-the-art risk systems. In particular, they must assess the
uncertainty about the future values of their portfolios and estimate the
extent and the likelihood of potential losses using a risk measure.
Nowadays, VaR and ES risk measures are the standards [@jorion.1997]. For
an asset (or portfolio) return, the VaR at a given time horizon equals
the return such that lower returns only occur with a given probability
level $\alpha$ (referred to as the *risk level*, and which is typically
set to one or five percent, that is $\alpha\in\{0.01,0.05\}$). The ES
risk measure is the expectation of the asset (or portfolio) return when
the return is below the VaR level.

The estimation of the VaR and ES thus requires first to accurately
estimate the conditional distribution of the future portfolios' or
assets' returns. Formally, assuming a continuous cumulative density
function (*cdf*) with time-varying parameters
${\mathbf{\theta}}_t\in\mathbb{R}^d$ and additional static parameters
${\mathbf{\psi}}\in\mathrm{R}^q$,
$F(\cdot;{\mathbf{\theta}}_t, {\mathbf{\psi}})$, for the log return at
time $t$, $r_t\in\mathbb{R}$, the $VaR_t(\alpha)$ is given by:
$$VaR_t(\alpha) \equiv F^{-1}(\alpha; {\mathbf{\theta}}_t, {\mathbf{\psi}}) \,,$$
where $F^{-1}(\cdot)$ denotes the inverse of the *cdf*, that is, the
quantile function. It follows that $VaR_t(\alpha)$ is nothing more than
the $\alpha$--quantile of the return distribution at time $t$.[^1] The
ES metric measures the expected loss after a violation of the VaR level
and it is defined as:
$$ES_t(\alpha) \equiv \frac{1}{\alpha}\int_{-\infty}^{VaR_t} z \, dF(z, {\mathbf{\theta}}_t, {\mathbf{\psi}}) \,.$$
It follows that a crucial point for correct VaR and ES assessment is the
determination of $F(\cdot)$ and its parameters ${\mathbf{\theta}}_t$ and
${\mathbf{\psi}}$. For a general overview of existing methods, we refer
the reader to @NietoRuiz2016. In this paper, we illustrate how this can
be achieved using the framework of Generalized Autoregressive Score
(GAS) models introduced by @creal_etal.2013 and @harvey.2013. GAS models
are also referred to as Score Driven (SD) models and Dynamic Conditional
Score (DCS) models and have been used extensively for financial risk
management purposes. For a comparison between the accuracy of VaR and ES
estimates obtained by the GAS approach against alternative volatility
models, we refer the reader to @bernardi_catania.2016, @GaoZhou2016,
[@ArdiaEtAl2018] and [@ardia_etal.2019].

Formally, in GAS models the vector of time-varying parameters,
${\mathbf{\theta}}_t$, is updated through a dynamic equation based on
the score of the conditional[^2] probability density function of $r_t$,
$f(\cdot;{\mathbf{\theta}}_t,{\mathbf{\psi}})$, that is:
$$\label{eq:update}
{\mathbf{\theta}}_{t+1} \equiv {\mathbf{\kappa}}+ \mathbf{A}\mathbf{s}_t + \mathbf{B}{\mathbf{\theta}}_t \,,   (\#eq:update)$$
where $\mathbf{s}_t$ is the (possibly) scaled score of
$f(\cdot;{\mathbf{\theta}}_t,{\mathbf{\psi}})$ with respect to
${\mathbf{\theta}}_t$, evaluated in $r_t$; see @creal_etal.2013 and also
the Appendix for examples. The coefficients ${\mathbf{\kappa}}$,
$\mathbf{A}$, and $\mathbf{B}$ control for the evolution of
${\mathbf{\theta}}_t$ and need to be estimated along with
${\mathbf{\psi}}$ from the data, usually by maximum likelihood.

We focus on the three major steps practitioners involved in risk
management face during their job: (i) prediction of future downside
risk, (ii) backtesting, and (iii) comparison with alternative models.
The empirical part of the article deals with these three points from an
applied perspective while the computational part details the *GAS*
functionalities devoted to downside risk.

# A flexible GAS specification for modeling financial returns {#section:sst}

Financial returns exhibit several stylized facts that need to be taken
into consideration to produce reliable risk forecasts. Empirically, the
distribution of returns is (left) skewed and fat tailed, and its
variance is time varying (*i.e.*, returns exhibit the so-called
*volatility clustering*); see, for example, @mcneil.2015.

To account for these features, we consider a very flexible
specification, in which we assume that the log return at time $t$,
$r_t$, is distributed conditionally on past observations as follows:
$$r_{t}\vert\mathcal{I}_{t-1}\sim\mathcal{SKST}(r_t;\mu,\sigma_{t},\xi,\nu) \,,$$
where $\mathcal{I}_{t-1}$ is the information set up to time $t-1$, and
$\mathcal{SKST}\left(r_t;\cdot\right)$ denotes the skew Student-t
distribution of @fernandez_steel.1998 with location $\mu\in\mathbb{R}$,
time-varying scale (volatility) $\sigma_t>0$, and skewness and shape
parameters $\xi>0$ and $\nu>2$, respectively. We parametrize the
$\mathcal{SKST}$ distribution as in @bauwens_laurent.2005 such that
$\mathsf{E}[r_t\,|\,\mathcal{I}_{t-1}]=\mu$ and
$\mathsf{V}[r_t\,|\,\mathcal{I}_{t-1}] = \sigma_t^2$. To ensure
positivity of the volatility parameter, we set the time-varying GAS
parameter ${\mathbf{\theta}}_t$ in \@ref(eq:update) to
${\mathbf{\theta}}_t \equiv \theta_t \equiv \log\sigma_t$, and we define
${\mathbf{\psi}}\equiv (\mu, \xi, \nu)$. In the Appendix, we show that
the corresponding score $s_t$ which enters linearly in the updating
equation \@ref(eq:update) is given by:
$$s_t \equiv \left(\frac{z_t\left(\nu + 1\right)\left(z_t-m\right)}{\left(\xi_t^*\right)^2\left(\nu - 2\right) + z_t^2} - 1\right) \,,$$
with $\xi_t^* \equiv \xi^{I\{z_t \geq 0 \} - I\{z_t \leq 0 \}}$, where
$I\{ \cdot \}$ is the indicator function equal to one if the condition
holds, and zero otherwise, and with
$z_t \equiv \left(\frac{r_t - \mu}{\sigma_t}\right)k + m$, where
expressions for $k$ and $m$ are provided in the Appendix. For a fixed
value of the asymmetry parameter $\xi$, we see that the effect of shock
on future values is dampened when $\nu$ decreases. Starting from the
general $\mathcal{SKST}$ distribution, we recover as special cases:

-   the Student-t distribution, $\mathcal{ST}$, imposing $\xi = 1$;
-   the Normal distribution, $\mathcal{N}$, imposing $\nu = \infty$ and
    $\xi = 1$.

(See the Appendix for the score in these cases.) Given a series of $T$
log returns, $r_1,\dots,r_T$, the model parameters are estimated by
maximizing the log-likelihood function; see @blasques_etal.2014b.
Prediction with GAS models is straightforward thanks to the recursive
nature of the updating equation \@ref(eq:update). Specifically, the
one-step ahead predictive distribution
$F(\cdot;\widehat{\mathbf{\theta}}_{T+1},\widehat{\mathbf{\psi}})$ is
available in closed form whereas the $h$-step ahead distribution ($h>1$)
needs to be simulated; see @blasques_etal.2016. VaR and ES forecasts are
easily obtained from the predictive distribution.

# Evaluating downside risk forecasts

The recursive method of forecasting is usually employed to backtest the
adequacy of a statistical model, as well as to perform models
comparisons in terms of VaR and ES predictions [@marcellino_etal.2006].
The objective of a backtesting analysis is to verify the precision of
the prediction by separating the estimation window and the evaluation
period. The objective of a model comparison analysis is usually to order
models according to a loss function.

To this end, the full sample of $T$ returns is divided into an in-sample
period of length $S$, and an out-of-sample period of length $H$. Model
parameters are first estimated over the in-sample period, subsequently
the $h$-step ahead prediction of the return distribution at time $S+h$
is generated along with the corresponding VaR and ES measures. These
steps are repeated augmenting the in-sample period with new observations
in a recursive way until we reach the end of the series, $T$. If during
the data augmentation step, past observations are eliminated, we are
considering a rolling window, otherwise we have an expanding window. In
this paper, we follow the standard approach in daily risk management of
a typical trading desk and use the rolling window configuration with
$h = 1$.

## VaR backtesting

Once a series of VaR predictions is available, forecasts adequacy is
assessed through backtesting procedures. VaR backtesting procedures
usually check the correct coverage of the unconditional and conditional
left-tail of the log-returns distribution. Correct unconditional
coverage (UC) was first considered by @kupiec.1995, while correct
conditional coverage (CC) by @christoffersen.1998. The main difference
between UC and CC concerns the distribution we are focusing on. For
instance, UC considers correct coverage of the left-tail of the
unconditional log-return distribution, $f(r_t)$, while CC deals with the
conditional density $f(r_t\vert\mathcal{I}_{t-1})$. From an inferential
perspective, UC looks at the ratio between the number of realized VaR
violations observed from the data and the expected number of VaR
violations implied by the chosen risk level, $\alpha$, during the
forecast period, that is, $\alpha H$. In order to investigate CC,
@christoffersen.1998 proposed a test on the series of VaR exceedance
$\{d_{t},t = S,\dots,S + H\}$, where
$d_{t} \equiv I\{r_{t}<VaR_{t}(\alpha)\}$, usually referred to as the
*hitting series*. Specifically, if correct conditional coverage is
achieved by the model, VaR exceedances should be independently
distributed over time.

The DQ test by @engle_manganelli.2004 assesses the joint hypothesis that
$\mathsf{E}[d_t] = \alpha$ and the hit variables are independently
distributed. The implementation of the test involves the de-meaned
process $Hit^\alpha_t \equiv d_t - \alpha$. Under correct model
specification, unconditionally and conditionally, $Hit^\alpha_t$ has
zero mean and is serially uncorrelated. The DQ test is then the
traditional Wald test of the joint nullity of all coefficients in the
following linear regression:
$$Hit^\alpha_t = \delta_0 + \sum_{l=1}^{L} \delta_l Hit^\alpha_{t-l} + \delta_{L+1} VaR_{t-1}(\alpha) +  \epsilon_t\,.$$
Under the null hypothesis of correct unconditional and conditional
coverage, we have that the Wald test statistic is asymptotically
chi-square distributed with $L + 2$ degrees of freedom.
@engle_manganelli.2004 set $L = 4$ lags, which has become the standard
choice.

## VaR model comparison

Real world applications consider several models for VaR prediction. If
correct unconditional/conditional coverage is achieved by more than one
model, the practitioner faces the problem of not being able to choose
between different alternatives. In this situation, model comparison
techniques are used to choose the best performing model. Model ranking
is achieved thanks to the definition of a loss function. Among several
available loss functions for quantile prediction
[@mcaleer_daveiga.2008], the Quantile Loss (QL) used for quantile
regressions [@koenker_bassett.1978] is one of the most frequent choices
in the VaR context; see @gonzalezriviera_etal.2004. Formally, given a
VaR prediction at risk level $\alpha$ for time $t$, the associated
quantile loss, $QL_{t}\left(\alpha\right)$, is defined as:
$$\label{eq:loss}
QL_{t}(\alpha) \equiv (\alpha - d_{t} )\left(r_{t} - VaR_{t}(\alpha\right)) \,.   (\#eq:loss)$$
QL is an asymmetric loss function that penalizes more heavily with
weight $\left(1 - \alpha\right)$ the observations for which we observe
returns showing VaR exceedance. Quantile losses are then averaged over
the forecasting period, and models with lower averages are preferred.
The outperformance of model $\mathcal{A}$ versus model $\mathcal{B}$ is
finally assessed looking at the ratio between the average QLs,
associated with the two models, that is, if
$QL_\mathcal{A}/QL_\mathcal{B} < 1$ then model $\mathcal{A}$ outperforms
model $\mathcal{B}$ and vice versa.

## Joint VaR and ES model comparison

The quantile loss function in \@ref(eq:loss) for VaR assessment is
appropriate since quantiles are elicited by it, that is, when the
conditional distribution is static over the sample, the VaR can be
estimated by minimizing the average quantile loss function.
Unfortunately, there is no loss function available for which the ES risk
measure is elicitable; see, for instance, @Bellini2015 and @Ziegel2016.
However, it has been recently shown by @FisslerZiegel2016 (FZ) that the
couple (VaR, ES) is jointly elicitable, as the values of $v_t$ and $e_t$
that minimize the sample average of the following loss function:
$$FZ(r_t, v_t, e_t, \alpha, G_1, G_2) \equiv  (d_{t} - \alpha)\left(G_1(v_t)  -  G_1(r_t) + \frac{1}{\alpha} G_2(e_t)v_t\!\right) - G_2(e_t)\left(\frac{1}{\alpha}d_t r_t - e_t\right) - \mathcal{G}_2(e_t) \,,$$
where $G_1$ is weakly increasing, $G_2$ is strictly positive and
strictly increasing, and $\mathcal{G}_2^\prime = G_2$. The *GAS* package
implements the FZ loss function for a specific choice of $G_1$, $G_2$
and $\mathcal{G}_2$. We set $G_1(x) = 0$ and $G_2(x) = -1/x$ and assume
the values of VaR and ES to be strictly negative; see @PattonEtAl2017
and [@ArdiaEtAl2018] for a similar approach. For VaR and ES predictions
at risk level $\alpha$ for time $t$, the associated joint loss function
(FZL) is then given by:
$$\label{eq:FZL}
FZL_t^\alpha \equiv \frac{1}{\alpha\,ES_{t}^\alpha}
\, d_{t} \,(r_t - VaR_t^\alpha)
+ \frac{VaR_t^\alpha}{ES_t^\alpha} + \log(-ES_t^\alpha) - 1\,,   (\#eq:FZL)$$
for $ES_{t}^\alpha \leq VaR_t^\alpha <0$. As for QL, FZ losses are
averaged over the forecasting period and models with lower averages are
preferred.

Summarizing, given a set of available models, a typical downside risk
forecasting exercise consists of the following three major steps:

-   perform rolling forecast during the out-of-sample period;
-   perform statistical backtest of VaR predictions using UC, CC, and DQ
    tests;
-   perform VaR and joint VaR and ES model comparison looking at the
    average QL and FZL of each model.

The next section is devoted to detailing the implementation of each of
these steps with the *GAS* package.

# Empirical illustration

We first briefly review how to make predictions with GAS models using
the *GAS* package. The main illustration is for the last $T = 2,\!500$
observations of the daily log-returns of the General Electric stock in
the dataset `dji30ret`, which is a dataframe consisting of the thirty
Dow Jones Industrial Average constituents:

``` r
> library("GAS")
> data("dji30ret", package = "GAS")
> dji30ret <- tail(dji30ret, 2500)
```

The corresponding returns are shown as gray points in
Figure [1](#fig:VaR). We see the time-variation in the volatility of the
daily return series, which we model next using the GAS specification
with skewed Student-t innovations, as previously described. Thanks to
the *GAS* package, it is straightforward to estimate the GAS model on
rolling windows of the available data and to make one-step ahead rolling
forecasts.

![Figure 1: One-step ahead VaR forecasts for General Electric (GE) at
the $\alpha = 1\%$ risk level for the GAS--$\mathcal{N}$ (*solid*) and
GAS--$\mathcal{ST}$ (*dotted*) models. Gray points indicate realized log
returns calculated as the differences between the natural logarithm of
two consecutive prices. The forecasting period ranges from February 14,
2005, to February 3, 2009, for a total of $H=1,\!000$ out-of-sample
observations.](Figures/VaR_GE.png){#fig:VaR width="100.0%"
alt="graphic without alt text"}

Specifically, the user needs to specify the model through the
`UniGASSpec()` function, and then perform rolling predictions with the
`UniGASRoll()` function. In the *GAS* package, models are specified
through the definition of the conditional distribution assumed for the
data, `Dist`, and the list of time-varying parameters, `GASpar`.

`Dist` is a character equal to the label of the distribution. For
instance, $\mathcal{SKST}$ is identified as `"sstd"`, $\mathcal{ST}$ as
`"std"`, and $\mathcal{N}$ as `"norm"`; see Table 1 of @ardia_etal.2019
for the list of distributions and associated labels available in the
*GAS* package.

`GASPar` is a `list` with named `boolean` elements. Entries name are:
`location`, `scale`, `skewness`, and `shape`. These indicate whether the
associated distribution parameters are time varying or not. By default
we have
`GASPar = list(location = FALSE, scale = TRUE, skewness = FALSE, shape = FALSE)`,
that is, only volatility is time varying. For instance, in order to
specify the three GAS models: GAS--$\mathcal{N}$, GAS--$\mathcal{ST}$,
and GAS--$\mathcal{SKST}$, we need to execute the following lines:

``` r
> GASSpec_N <- UniGASSpec(Dist = "norm", GASPar = list(scale = TRUE))
> GASSpec_ST <- UniGASSpec(Dist = "std", GASPar = list(scale = TRUE))
> GASSpec_SKST <- UniGASSpec(Dist = "sstd", GASPar = list(scale = TRUE))
```

`UniGASSpec()` delivers an object of the class `"uGASSpec"` which comes
with several methods; see `help("UniGASSpec")`.

The `UniGASRoll()` function accepts an object of the class `"uGASSpec"`,
`"GASSpec"`, a `numeric` vector for the series of returns, `data`, and
other arguments, such as:

-   the length of the out-of-sample period: `ForecastLength`;
-   the type of the rolling window used to update the data:
    `RefitWindow`;
-   the number of observations within each model re-estimation:
    `RefitEvery`,

among others; see `help("UniGASRoll")`. `ForecastLength` and
`RefitEvery` are `numeric` elements while `RefitWindow` is a `character`
equal to `"moving"` (the default) for a rolling window scheme or
`"recursive"` for an expanding window. As previously mentioned, in this
paper we consider the case `RefitWindow = "moving"`. We fix the length
of the out-of-sample period to $H=1000$, and re-estimate the model
parameters at the weekly frequency (i.e., every 5 new observations).
One-step ahead rolling predictions for the first series of returns using
the GAS--$\mathcal{N}$ model are then computed as:

``` r
> library("parallel")
> cluster <- makeCluster(2)
> H <- 1000
> Roll_N <- UniGASRoll(dji30ret[, "GE"], GASSpec_N, RefitEvery = 5,
  cluster = cluster, ForecastLength = H)
```

We have also made use of parallel processing (with 2 cores) through the
definition of a `cluster` object exploiting the *parallel* package
included in R since version 2.14.0.

The output of `UniGASRoll()` is an object of the class `"uGASRoll"`
which comes with several methods; see `help("UniGASRoll")`.

VaR and ES one-step ahead rolling forecasts at the risk level
$\alpha = 0.01$ can be computed from `Roll_N` using the `quantile` and
`ES` methods, respectively:

``` r
> alpha <- 0.01
> VaR_N <- quantile(Roll_N, probs = alpha)
> ES_N <- ES(Roll_N, probs = alpha)
```

`VaR_N` and `ES_N` are matrices of dimension $1,\!000\times 1$
containing the VaR and ES forecasts at the 1% risk level.[^3] While VaR
predictions are obtaining by numerical inversion of the predicted
cumulative density function, ES predictions are computed by numerical
adaptive integration of the predicted density relying on the
[*cubature*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=cubature) package
[@cubature]. Multi-step ahead prediction of VaR and ES are obtained by
Monte Carlo simulation and are still computed with the `quantile` and
`ES` methods. To compute multi-step ahead predictions an object of class
`"uGASFor"` delivered by the function `UniGASFor` has to be provided;
see `help("UniGASFor")`.

Predictions for the GAS--$\mathcal{ST}$ and GAS--$\mathcal{SST}$
specifications using the `GASSpec_ST` and `GASSpec_SKST` model
definitions are computed analogously. Figure [1](#fig:VaR) reports 1%
VaR predictions delivered by the GAS--$\mathcal{N}$ (*solid* line) and
the GAS--$\mathcal{ST}$ (*dotted* line). We see the impact of the recent
Global Financial Crisis on the volatility of the series. Indeed, the
2007-2008 returns of GE present much more variability than over the
period 2005-2006, which is translated into lower values for VaR. What is
also clearly evident from Figure [1](#fig:VaR), is the robustness of the
GAS--$\mathcal{ST}$ model to extreme observations compared with
GAS--$\mathcal{N}$. Indeed, on April 11, 2008, General Electric reported
an unexpected net income drop of 6%, which in turn translated to a fall
of about 12% of its market value. The signal captured by
GAS--$\mathcal{N}$ was that of an abrupt increase in volatility, with
the consequence of large VaR level predictions. In contrast, the
GAS--$\mathcal{ST}$ model slightly increased the volatility level and
continued to predict reasonable VaR levels. What happened is that,
GAS--$\mathcal{ST}$ treated the 12% negative return as a realization
from the fat-tailed Student-t distribution, hence tapering its impact on
the conditional volatility level. On the contrary, GAS--$\mathcal{N}$
treated the negative return as a realization from the Normal
distribution, which is a clear signal of increase of volatility. The
same behavior of the GAS--$\mathcal{N}$ specification is shown in the ES
predictions (not reported to save space).

## VaR backtesting

Let us now show how the accuracy of the VaR forecasts can be evaluated
using the `BacktestVaR()` function in the *GAS* package. This function
accepts the following arguments:

-   `data`, `numeric` containing the out-of-sample data;
-   `VaR`, `numeric` containing the series of VaR forecasts;
-   `alpha`, the VaR risk level $\alpha$;
-   `Lags`, the number of lags used in the DQ test, by default
    `Lags = 4`; see @engle_manganelli.2004.

The function returns a `list` with named entries:

-   `LRuc`, the test statistic and associated $p$-value for the UC test
    of @kupiec.1995;
-   `LRcc`, the test statistic and associated $p$-value for the CC test
    of @christoffersen.1998;
-   `DQ`, the test statistic and associated $p$-value for the DQ test of
    @engle_manganelli.2004;
-   `Loss`, the quantile loss (QL), as defined in (\@ref(eq:loss)),
    together with the average QL used by @gonzalezriviera_etal.2004;
-   `AD`, the mean and max VaR Absolute Deviation (AD) used by
    @mcaleer_daveiga.2008;
-   `AE`, the Actual over Expected ratio.

For instance, in order to compute the VaR backtest measures defined
above on the forecast series `VaR_N`, we use:

``` r
> VaRBacktest_N <- BacktestVaR(data = tail(dji30ret[, "GE"], H), VaR = VaR_N, alpha = alpha)
```

Then, the DQ test statistic and its associated $p$-value can be
extracted as:

``` r
> VaRBacktest_N$DQ
$stat
         [,1]
[1,] 52.47578

$pvalue
           [,1]
[1,] 4.7043e-09
```

which, in this case, is against the null of correct model specification
for the 1% VaR level.

Now, if we evaluate VaR forecasts using the GAS--$\mathcal{ST}$ model,
and save the results as the `VaRBacktest_ST` object, then the DQ test
reports:

``` r
> VaRBacktest_ST$DQ
$stat
         [,1]
[1,] 8.763418

$pvalue
         [,1]
[1,] 0.270091
```

  : Table 1: DQ test statistic $p$-values for the Dow Jones Industrial
  Average constituents one-step ahead VaR forecasts at the two downside
  risk levels $\alpha = 1\%$ and $\alpha = 5\%$. Under the null
  hypothesis, we have correct model specification for the chosen risk
  level. Light gray cells indicate $p$-values lower than 1%. The
  forecasting period ranges from February 14, 2005, to February 3, 2009,
  for a total of $H=1,\!000$ out-of-sample observations. The model
  parameters are re-estimated at the monthly frequency.
:::

The large $p$-value indicates that the null of the correct model
specification for the 1% VaR cannot be rejected at the usual levels of
significance for the GAS--$\mathcal{ST}$ model.

We reproduce this analysis for each of the thirty daily stock return
series in the `dji30ret` data set previously detailed. The out-of-sample
period starts on February 14, 2005, and includes the recent Global
Financial Crisis of 2007-2008. We consider two VaR risk levels:
$\alpha = 1\%$ and $\alpha = 5\%$. The code used for this application is
available in the GitHub *GAS* repository:
<https://github.com/LeopoldoCatania/GAS/wiki>.

Table [1](#tab:DQ) reports the $p$-values of the DQ test for the three
model specifications and the two VaR risk levels. Under the null
hypothesis, we have correct model specification for the
$\alpha$-quantile level. Clearly, our results indicate that
GAS--$\mathcal{N}$ is suboptimal with respect to GAS--$\mathcal{ST}$ and
GAS--$\mathcal{SKST}$ in terms of correct unconditional and conditional
coverage. This result is somehow expected since GAS--$\mathcal{ST}$ and
GAS--$\mathcal{SKST}$ exhibit excess kurtosis and deliver more robust
updates for the volatility parameter than GAS--$\mathcal{N}$. Moreover,
we see that GAS--$\mathcal{ST}$ and GAS--$\mathcal{SKST}$ perform
similarly in terms of correct unconditional and conditional coverage.
Hence, the inclusion of skewness does not seem to increase the
performance of VaR predictions for the considered series. Indeed,
sometimes results are even worse for GAS--$\mathcal{SKST}$ compared with
GAS--$\mathcal{ST}$, indicating that the estimation error for the
additional skewness parameter could worsen VaR predictions. This is the
case for example for 3M Company (MMM) when GAS--$\mathcal{SKST}$ rejects
the null for $\alpha = 1\%$, whereas GAS--$\mathcal{ST}$ does not.

## VaR model comparison

The goal of VaR model comparison is to rank the models in terms of
accuracy of their VaR forecasts. This can be done using the average
value of the quantile loss in \@ref(eq:loss), as available in the output
from the `BacktestVaR()` function.

In our application on the daily stock returns of General Electric, we
find that the model comparison in terms of average QL also favors
GAS--$\mathcal{ST}$ compared with GAS--$\mathcal{N}$. Indeed the ratio
between the QL of GAS--$\mathcal{ST}$ and GAS--$\mathcal{N}$ is below
unity indicating a lower average quantile loss when using the
GAS--$\mathcal{ST}$:

``` r
> round(VaRBacktest_ST$Loss$Loss / VaRBacktest_N$Loss$Loss, 2)
[1] 0.94
```

This indicates that GAS--$\mathcal{ST}$ outperforms GAS--$\mathcal{N}$
by 6% in terms of average QL.

The left part of Table [2](#tab:loss) (QL ratios) reports the results of
repeating this model comparison analysis for all thirty daily stock
return series in the `dji30ret` dataset.[^4] It shows, for both
$\alpha=1\%$ and $\alpha=5\%$, the ratios between the average QL of the
considered models over the one delivered by GAS--$\mathcal{N}$. Values
greater than one indicate outperformance of GAS--$\mathcal{N}$, and vice
versa. Consistently with the DQ test results, we find that
GAS--$\mathcal{ST}$ and GAS--$\mathcal{SKST}$ perform similarly and are
preferred to GAS--$\mathcal{N}$.

## Joint VaR and ES model comparison

The `FZLoss` function implements the FZ loss and accepts the following
arguments:

-   `data`: vector of observations;
-   `VaR`: vector of VaR predictions;
-   `ES`: vector of ES predictions;
-   `alpha`: the $\alpha$ risk level.

This function returns a `numeric` vector of the same size of `data` with
the FZ losses computed at each point in time. For instance, using the
`VaR_N` and `ES_N` vectors previously computed we can evaluate the
associated FZ loss as:

``` r
> FZL <- FZLoss(data = tail(dji30ret[, "GE"], H), VaR = VaR_N, ES = ES_N,
                alpha = alpha)
```

where `FZL` is a `numeric` vector of length `H`.

The right part of Table [2](#tab:loss) (FZL ratios) reports the results
of performing model comparison analysis for all thirty daily stock
return series in the `dji30ret` dataset according to the FZ loss
reported in \@ref(eq:FZL). It shows, for both $\alpha=1\%$ and
$\alpha=5\%$, the ratios between the average FZ loss of the considered
models over the one delivered by GAS--$\mathcal{N}$. Values greater than
one indicate outperformance of GAS--$\mathcal{N}$, and vice versa.
Consistently with the comparison in terms of only VaR predictions, we
find that GAS--$\mathcal{ST}$ and GAS--$\mathcal{SKST}$ perform
similarly and are preferred to GAS--$\mathcal{N}$.

# Conclusion

Under the regulation of the Basel Accords, risk managers of financial
institutions need to rely on state-of-the-art methodologies for
predicting and evaluating their downside risk [@BGFRS2012]. This article
illustrates the usefulness of the R package *GAS* in putting the theory
of modern downside risk management into practice. The recommended
strategy consists of four steps: (i) model specification, (ii) downside
risk predictions, (iii) backtesting, and (iv) model comparison. We
illustrate this proposed implementation in R using the package *GAS*
applied to the Value-at-Risk and Expected Shortfall estimation for the
daily returns of the thirty Dow Jones Industrial Average constituents.

# Computational details

The results in this paper were obtained using R 3.5.0 with the package
*GAS* version 0.2.8 available on `CRAN` at

# Appendix

To obtain the score of the $\mathcal{SKST}$ distribution, we first write
its log density evaluated in $r_t$:
$$\log f_{\mathcal{SKST}}\left(r_t;\mu,\sigma_t,\xi,\nu\right) = \log g + \log k + c - \log\sigma_t - \frac{\nu+1}{2}\log\left[1 + \frac{\left[\left(\frac{r_t - \mu}{\sigma_t}\right)k + m\right]^2}{\left(\nu-2\right)\left(\xi_t^*\right)^2}\right] \,,$$
where:
$$\begin{aligned}
m &\equiv \mu_1\left(\xi - \frac{1}{\xi}\right) \\
k &\equiv \sqrt{\left(1 - \mu_1^2\right)\left(\xi^2 + \frac{1}{\xi^2}\right) + 2\mu_1^2 - 1}\\
g &\equiv \frac{2}{\xi + \frac{1}{\xi}}\\
c &\equiv \frac{1}{2}\left[ - \log\left(\nu -2\right) - \log\pi \right] + \log\Gamma\left(\frac{\nu + 1}{2}\right) - \log\Gamma\left(\frac{\nu}{2}\right) \,,
\end{aligned}$$
with:
$$\mu_1 \equiv \frac{2\sqrt{\nu - 2}}{(\nu - 1)}\frac{\Gamma(\frac{\nu+1}{2})}{\Gamma(\tfrac{\nu}{2})\Gamma(\tfrac{1}{2})} \,,$$
and $\xi_t^* \equiv \xi^{I\{z_t \geq 0 \} - I\{z_t \leq 0 \}}$, where
$I\{ \cdot \}$ is the indicator function, and
$z_t \equiv \left(\frac{r_t - \mu}{\sigma_t}\right)k + m$. Taking the
partial derivative of the log density with respect to $\theta_t$, yields
the score $s_t$, given by:
$$s_t \equiv \frac{\partial \log f_{\mathcal{SKST}}}{\partial \theta_t} = \left(\frac{z_t\left(\nu + 1\right)\left(z_t-m\right)}{\left(\xi_t^*\right)^2\left(\nu - 2\right) + z_t^2} - 1\right) \,.$$
In the case where $\xi = 1$, we have $m = 0$, and the score becomes:
$$s_t = \left(\frac{z_t^2\left(\nu + 1\right)}{\left(\nu - 2\right) + z_t^2} - 1\right) \,,$$
which is the score of a Student-t distribution. Finally, when
$\nu\to\infty$, we obtain:
$$s_t = z_t^2 - 1 \,,$$
which is the score of the Normal distribution.

[^1]: Sometimes VaR is defined with respect to the loss variable
    $l_t = -r_t$. All the arguments of this paper can be easily adapted
    to this case.

[^2]: The conditioning is intended with respect to the past observations
    $r_{t-s}$ $(s>0)$, however, for notational purposes, this is not
    always reported.

[^3]: The `probs` argument in `quantile` and `ES` can also be a
    `numeric` vector of $p$ VaR levels. In this case, `VaR_N` and `ES_N`
    would be a $1000\times p$ `matrix`.

[^4]: Here we re-estimate the model parameters at the monthly frequency
    (*i.e.*, every 21 new observations).
