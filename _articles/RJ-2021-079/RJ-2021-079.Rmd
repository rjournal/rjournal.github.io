title: 'lg: An R package for Local Gaussian Approximations'
abstract: The package lg for the R programming language provides implementations of
  recent methodological advances on applications of the local Gaussian correlation.
  This includes the estimation of the local Gaussian correlation itself, multivariate
  density estimation, conditional density estimation, various tests for independence
  and conditional independence, as well as a graphical module for creating dependence
  maps. This paper describes the lg package, its principles, and its practical use.
