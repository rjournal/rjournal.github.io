title: 'Transitioning to R: Replicating SAS, Stata, and SUDAAN Analysis Techniques
  in Health Policy Data'
abstract: Statistical, data manipulation, and presentation tools make R an ideal integrated
  package for research in the fields of health policy and healthcare management and
  evaluation. However, the technical documentation accompanying most data sets used
  by researchers in these fields does not include syntax examples for analysts to
  make the transition from another statistical package to R. This paper describes
  the steps required to import health policy data into R, to prepare that data for
  analysis using the two most common complex survey variance calculation techniques,
  and to produce the principal set of statistical estimates sought by health policy
  researchers. Using data from the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey Household Component
  (MEPS-HC), this paper outlines complex survey data analysis techniques in R, with
  side-by-side comparisons to the SAS, Stata, and SUDAAN statistical software packages.
