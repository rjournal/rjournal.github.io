title: 'Transitioning to R: Replicating SAS, Stata, and SUDAAN Analysis Techniques
  in Health Policy Data'
abstract: Statistical, data manipulation, and presentation tools make R an ideal integrated
  package for research in the fields of health policy and healthcare management and
  evaluation. However, the technical documentation accompanying most data sets used
  by researchers in these fields does not include syntax examples for analysts to
  make the transition from another statistical package to R. This paper describes
  the steps required to import health policy data into R, to prepare that data for
  analysis using the two most common complex survey variance calculation techniques,
  and to produce the principal set of statistical estimates sought by health policy
  researchers. Using data from the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey Household Component
  (MEPS-HC), this paper outlines complex survey data analysis techniques in R, with
  side-by-side comparisons to the SAS, Stata, and SUDAAN statistical software packages.

# Introduction

Health-care researchers use survey data to evaluate the state of the
market and to inform the creation and implementation of new policies.
America's continuing discussion about the health-care system highlights
the unique role of population-generalizable data as a gauge for
estimating how proposed legislation will affect specific demographic
groups and the \$2.2 trillion health-care industry.[^1] Despite powerful
statistical analysis, data manipulation, and presentation capabilities,
R has not become widely adopted as a statistical package in the fields
of health policy or health-care management and evaluation. User
guidelines and other technical documents for government-funded and
publicly available data sets rarely provide appropriate code examples to
R users. The objective of this paper is to describe the steps required
to import health policy data into R, to prepare that data for analysis
using the two most common complex survey variance calculation
techniques, and to produce the principal set of statistical estimates
sought by health policy researchers.

This article compares means and standard errors produced by technical
documentation-recommended code examples for selected proprietary
statistical packages with those of the package available in R, using
data from the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey--Household Component
(MEPS-HC).[^2]

## Medical Expenditure Panel Survey--Household Component

-   Nationally representative (non-institutionalized) sample of health
    services utilization in the United States

-   Administered by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality
    (AHRQ)

-   Panel survey design allows tracking of all individuals and families
    for two calendar years

-   Person-level and event-level annual data available since 1996

MEPS-HC data provides a useful basis for cross-package comparisons
because variances can be estimated using both Taylor-series
linearization and replicate weighting methods, unlike most complex
sample survey data sets which recommend only one or the other.
Presenting a step-by-step methodology with the MEPS-HC data set allows
more convenient generalization to other data sets.

# Data preparation

AHRQ provides all downloadable MEPS files in both ASCII (.txt) and SAS
transport (.xpt and .ssp) formats, along with programming statements for
SAS and SPSS. The package imports SAS transport files with minimal
effort:

``` r
> library(foreign)
> h105 <- read.xport("h105.ssp")
```

Reading larger data sets with the `read.xport` function may overburden
system memory.[^3] If a memory error occurs, SAS transport files can be
converted to tab-delimited (.txt) files using the free SAS System
Viewerand then alternatively imported with the `read.table` function:

``` r
> h105 <- read.table("h105.dat", header=TRUE )
```

Should memory errors continue to occur due to a large number of
variables in the data set, database-backed survey design objects allow R
to access a table stored within a relational database using either DBI
or ODBC.[^4] This alternative does not conserve memory in data sets that
are large due to record count. The table is accessed directly by the
` svydesign` function (discussed later), through the addition of a
`dbname` argument to specify the location and a `dbtype` argument to
specify the database driver.

After successful import, unnecessary variables should be eliminated from
the data frame to increase processing speed. The `select` argument to
the `subset` command acts as the SAS *KEEP* option in a DATA step or the
Stata *keep* command, by dropping all unspecified fields. Distinct
subpopulation data frames could also be created with the `subset`
command; however, observations should not be excluded until the design
object has been created, in order to preserve the entire complex sample
design.[^5]

``` r
> #limit to specified fields
> meps06 <- subset(h105,
+   select = c(DUPERSID, PANEL, PERWT06F, VARSTR, 
+     VARPSU, AGE06X, TOTEXP06, REGION06, RTHLTH53))

> #clear memory of full data frame
> rm(h105)
```

All other recoding and re-categorization should occur at this stage. The
example below creates a categorical variable based on the age of the
individual using the `cut` function to delineate the appropriate
intervals.

``` r
> #recode linear to categorical
> # below 25 ; 25-34 ; 35-44 ; 45-54 ;
> # 55-64 ; 65-74 ; 75-84 ; 85+
> meps06[, "AGECAT"] <- cut(meps06[, "AGE06X"], 
+   br = c(-1, 24 + 10*0:6, Inf), labels = 1:8)
```

Note that the `labels` argument can directly produce character strings
rather than numeric categories. This example creates the same categories
as above, with character labels.

``` r
> #alternate character labels
> meps06[, "cAGECAT"] <- cut(meps06[, "AGE06X"], 
+   br = c(-1, 24+10*0:6, Inf),
+   labels = c('Below 25', '25-34', '35-44', 
+     '45-54', '55-64', '65-74', '75-84', '85+'))
```

Once all needed variables have been created, inapplicable or invalid
values should be converted to missing. This example combines the
'Excellent' and 'Very good' self-reported health status responses, then
assigns incomplete records as missing values.[^6]

``` r
> #combine ex (1) & vg health (2)
> # into the same response option
> meps06[, "RTHLTH53"] <- meps06[ ,"RTHLTH53"] - 1
> meps06[meps06[ ,"RTHLTH53"] == 0, "RTHLTH53"] <- 
+   1

> #recode negatives to missing (NA)
> meps06[meps06[ , "RTHLTH53"] < 0, "RTHLTH53"] <- 
+   NA
```

The addition of missing values to any variable within a data frame
requires that subsequent analyses of the variable include the
`na.rm = TRUE` argument in order to appropriately exclude those
observations.

At the conclusion of all data transformations, all variables that one
wishes to display in weighted column frequencies should be converted to
a character string in a new variable. The rationale behind this
conversion is discussed in the *Analysis* section.

``` r
> #char vars for region & health stat.
> meps06 <- transform(meps06,
+   cRTHLTH53 = as.character(RTHLTH53))
> meps06 <- transform(meps06,
+   cREGION06 = as.character(REGION06))
```

# Survey design for Taylor-series linearization

The estimation weight (PERWT06F), stratum (VARSTR), and primary sampling
unit (VARPSU) fields make up the MEPS survey design and allow for the
Taylor-series linearization method of standard error computation. The
*survey* package can then be used to create a complex sample survey
design object for each data set. After creation, the complex survey
design object replaces the R data frame as the target of all analysis
functions.

``` r
> library(survey)

> #create main tsl survey design obj.
> meps.tsl.dsgn <- svydesign(id = ~ VARPSU, 
+   strata = ~ VARSTR, weights = ~ PERWT06F,
+   data = meps06, nest = TRUE)
```

Survey design objects store (rather than point to) data sets at the time
of design object creation; any modifications of the `meps06` data frame
in subsequent steps require the above re-assignment of the design
objects in order to see those changes in subsequent analysis commands.

# Taylor-series linearization cross-package comparisons

Many health policy data sets with complex sample designs use the
Taylor-series linearization method for standard error computation. After
the appropriate survey design object has been created, point estimates
can be obtained.

``` r
> #total adult expendure mean & se
> svymean(~ TOTEXP06, 
+   subset(meps.tsl.dsgn, AGE06X > 17))

> #total nonelderly adult expenditure
> svymean(~ TOTEXP06 ,
+   subset(meps.tsl.dsgn, AGE06X > 17 
+     & AGE06X < 65))
```

As seen in Table [1](#table:1), R accurately replicates the estimates
derived by each of the other statistical packages, SAS, Stata, and
SUDAAN. The programming code for each of these other three packages
matches the AHRQ recommendations found in their data documentation. [^7]

: Table 1: Comparison of Taylor-Series Linearization Standard Error
Calculation Methods[]{#table1 label="table1"}
:::

Since policy research and evaluations often dictate that adults and
children be studied separately, this paper will chiefly analyze the data
set after restricting the sample to individuals aged 18 or above.
Although used throughout this paper, note that the `subset` design
object embedded in the functions above could be re-created as a pointer.

``` r
> x <- subset(meps.tsl.dsgn, AGE06X > 17)
```

# Data preparation and survey design for replicate weighting

*Note: Analysts solely interested in Taylor-series linearization can
skip this section.* Standard errors in MEPS-HC can be calculated without
the Balanced Repeated Replication (BRR) technique; however, these survey
design steps can be generalized to other health policy data sets that
recommend replicate weighting, including the Consumer Expenditure Survey
(CE) and the Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP).
Replicate weighting designs provide the dual advantages of allowing
quantile point estimate standard errors to be calculated with relative
ease and of maintaining accurate variances when a subpopulation under
examination has been so restricted as to contain a stratum with only one
PSU.[^8] The code below imports the MEPS-HC Replicates file and joins
that file with the adult file and the non-elderly adult file.

``` r
> #load the half-sample data
> library(foreign)
> brr <- read.xport("h36b06.ssp")

> #merge half-sample with main file
> meps.brr <- merge(meps06, brr, 
+   by.x = c("DUPERSID", "PANEL"), 
+   by.y = c("DUPERSID", "PANEL"), 
+   all=FALSE)
```

Note that if additional variables need to be removed from a data frame,
the select argument captures all fields in between two fields separated
by a colon - a shortcut particularly valuable for maintaining 64
replicate weight variables.

``` r
> meps.brr.sub <- subset(meps.brr, 
+   select = c(DUPERSID, PANEL, PERWT06F,
+     VARSTR, VARPSU, AGE06X, AGECAT,
+     TOTEXP06, REGION06, cREGION06,
+     RTHLTH53, cRTHLTH5, BRR1:BRR64))
```

The survey replicate weight function `svrepdesign` allows the creation
of a replicate weight-based survey design object. The `repweights`
argument requires the identification of the 64 replicate weight fields
in the data frame, obtained in the code below by isolating all fields
containing the string `"BRR"` with the `grep` function. Half-sample
replication techniques generally rely on the replicate weights equation
BRR**X**wt = BRR**X** \* 2 \* PERWT06F, where **X** is 1:64 and each
BRR**X** field is a binary variable containing an equal number of zeroes
and ones that are randomly distributed across the records in the data
set. If the series of replicate weights has already been computed to
BRR**X**wt, the `combined.weights` argument should be set to `TRUE`. The
downloadable MEPS BRR file contains only binary BRR**X** variables,
indicating that R must take the extra step of computing the BRR**X**wt
weights.[^9]

``` r
> #create meps brr survey design obj.
> meps.brr.dsgn <-svrepdesign(data = meps.brr,
+   repweights = 
+     meps.brr[ ,grep("^BRR", colnames(meps.brr))], 
+   type = "BRR", combined.weights = FALSE,
+   weights = meps.brr$PERWT06F)
```

# Replicate weighting cross-package comparisons

*Note: Analysts solely interested in Taylor-series linearization can
skip this section.* Data sets used for health policy research often
require the calculation of standard errors using replicate weights.
Using the same `svymean` function, the point estimate can be obtained
again by simply changing the survey design object.

``` r
> #brr method: total $ mean & se
> svymean(~ TOTEXP06, 
+   subset(meps.brr.dsgn, AGE06X > 17))
```

As seen in Table [2](#table:2), the survey design object created by R
matches the Stata variance estimation precisely where the mean-squared
error (MSE) option has *not* been selected; this estimate is derived
from the sum of squares of the replicate estimates centered at the mean
of those estimates. Stata's variance estimation using the MSE option and
SUDAAN's built-in replicate weighting algorithm both center on the
actual point estimate rather than the mean of the replicate estimates,
resulting in a slightly larger confidence interval. The choice between
these two techniques does not have any theoretical considerations, and
the results are almost always similar. Though marginally different,
standard errors computed with R are equally valid as those computed with
SUDAAN or with Stata's MSE method. Two statistical tests conducted using
the standard errors from the different packages will almost always
produce a numerically different but substantively compatible result.

: Table 2: Comparison of Balanced Repeated Replication Standard Error
Calculation Methods[]{#table2 label="table2"}
:::

Comparison code for SAS was not included in Table [2](#table:2) because
the base package requires the calculation of replicate weighting
estimates with user-written code.

# Analysis {#sec:analysis}

The core functions included in R's *survey* package allow the rapid
estimation and cross-tabulation of means, distributions, frequencies,
and quantiles. Each of the discussed operations also produces standard
errors, except for the quantile calculations using Taylor-series
linearization design objects.

## Unweighted frequencies

Before conducting analysis on the complex survey design object, simple
unweighted frequencies can be produced using the `xtabs` function.
Unweighted frequencies only assure that sufficient cell sizes exist,
meaning that the complex design does not need to be accounted for.
Therefore, this function refers to the source data set, rather than the
design object.

``` r
> #calculate unweighted cell size
> xtabs( ~ RTHLTH53 + REGION06,
+   subset(meps06, AGE06X > 7))
```

## Distributions

As previously shown, the `svymean` function calculates mean values for
any numeric variable. When given character variables, however, `svymean`
computes percentages of the total. Notice the presence of the
`na.rm = TRUE` argument to eliminate missing values from the results.

``` r
> #percent distribution w/ svymean
> #determine % adults in each state
> # (ex. poor health 3.26%)
> a <- svymean(~ cRTHLTH53, 
+   subset(meps.tsl.dsgn, AGE06X > 17), 
+     na.rm = TRUE)
> a
```

Although this paper focuses on data manipulation and analysis, R
includes powerful formatting and presentation tools. Individuals
interested in converting simple tables --- like the one produced by the
code below --- into more advanced graphics should research the R
packages *graphics*, , *grid*, *grDevices*, as well as LaTeXÂ converters
like and .

``` r
> #label & format health status
> ftable(a, 
+   list(c("Excellent / Very good", 
+     "Good", "Fair", "Poor")))
```

Variables not converted to character before the creation of the design
object can be hastily converted using the `as.character` function within
the `svymean` command. Also notice the absence of the `na.rm` argument,
since missing values were not assigned for any cases of the *REGION06*
variable.

``` r
# % adults living in census regions
# (ex. northeastern 18.64%)
> svymean(~ as.character(REGION06),
+   subset(meps.tsl.dsgn, AGE06X > 17))
```

## Weighted frequencies and totals

The `svytotal` and `svytable` functions can be used to calculate both
weighted aggregate values and population estimates.

``` r
> #total 2006 health expenditures
> #all non-institutionalized adults
> # ($892 billion)
> svytotal(~ TOTEXP06, 
+   subset(meps.tsl.dsgn, AGE06X > 17))

> #num adults in census regions
> # (ex. northeastern 41.47 million)
> svytable(~ REGION06, 
+   subset(meps.tsl.dsgn, AGE06X > 17))

> #alternate method
> svytotal(~ as.character(REGION06), 
+   subset(meps.tsl.dsgn, AGE06X > 17))
```

## Medians and quantiles

The `svyquantile` function calculates each of the percentiles specified
in the `quantile` argument. For example, a value of 0.5 generates the
median. However, any number of quantiles can be produced with by
specifying a vector of values.

``` r
> #median 2006 health expenditure
> svyquantile(~ TOTEXP06,
+   subset(meps.tsl.dsgn, AGE06X > 17), 0.5)

> #calculate expenditure percentiles
> svyquantile(~ TOTEXP06,
+   subset(meps.tsl.dsgn, AGE06X > 17), 
+   c(0.1, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 0.9))
```

Although there are a number of other methods for constructing an
interval estimate, the Taylor-series linearization design object will
not produce standard errors in `svyquantile` since the CDF is not
differentiable.[^10] Median standard errors can be obtained normally if
a replicate weighting design object exists for the data.

``` r
> #brr method: median health $
> svyquantile(~ TOTEXP06, 
+   subset(meps.brr.dsgn, AGE06X > 17), 0.5)
```

If replicate weights do not exist for the data set, a jackknife
replication design can be created by converting the Taylor-series
linearization design object.

``` r
> #convert tsl to jackknife design
> meps.jackknife.dsgn <-
+   as.svrepdesign(meps.tsl.dsgn, "auto")

> #jackknife method: median health $
> svyquantile(~ TOTEXP06,
+   subset(meps.jackknife.dsgn, AGE06X > 17), 0.5)
```

Although this jackknife technique might produce a ballpark standard
error statistic, recommended quantile standard error calculations can
vary depending on the data set and analysis method. Some textbooks
simply estimate median standard error as 25% larger than the mean
standard error.[^11] Therefore, technical documentation and/or data
support staff should be consulted before relying on this survey design
conversion.

## Crosstabulation of totals, means, and quantiles

The `svyby` command repeats a specified function, iterating across the
set of distinct values in another factor variable also within the data
frame. This function is comparable to `lapply`, which runs across
individual elements contained in an external vector. Rather than running
the indicated function on the entire data set, `svyby` analyzes discrete
subpopulations.

``` r
> #health spending by census region
> # (ex. northeast $173 billion)
> svyby(~ TOTEXP06, ~ REGION06,
+   subset(meps.tsl.dsgn, AGE06X > 17), svytotal)

> #regional mean spending on health
> # (ex. northeast $4,171)
> svyby(~ TOTEXP06, ~ REGION06,
+   subset(meps.tsl.dsgn, AGE06X > 17), svymean)

> #stratified by health status
> # (ex. northeast poor hlth $18,038)
> svyby(~ TOTEXP06, ~ REGION06 + RTHLTH53,
+   subset(meps.tsl.dsgn, AGE06X > 17), svymean)

> #top quartile by health status
> # (ex. poor health $19,130)
> svyby(~ TOTEXP06, ~ RTHLTH53,
+   design = subset(meps.tsl.dsgn, AGE06X > 17), 
+   FUN = svyquantile, quantiles = 0.75, ci = TRUE)
```

## Crosstabulation of distributions

In addition to the straightforward distributions presented using the
`svymean` function, the `svyby` function allows row and column percents
to be calculated using any desired factor variable(s).

``` r
> #dist of hlth stat by census region
> svyby(~ cREGION06, ~cRTHLTH53,
+   subset(meps.tsl.dsgn, AGE06X > 17), svymean)

> #dist of census region by hlth stat
> svyby(~ cRTHLTH53, ~cREGION06,
+   subset(meps.tsl.dsgn, AGE06X > 17), svymean, 
+   na.rm = TRUE)
```

Unlike row and column percents, table percents do not require the
`svyby` command and can be calculated using the `interaction` function.
This approach is principally useful when one wishes to examine a
sub-subpopulation in relation to the entire population, rather than in
relation to its parent subpopulation.

``` r
> #total % in each hlth stat & region
> svymean(~ interaction(cRTHLTH53, cREGION06), 
+   subset(meps.tsl.dsgn, AGE06X > 17), 
+   na.rm = TRUE)

> #repeat above with weighted counts
> svytotal(~ interaction(cRTHLTH53, cREGION06), 
+   subset(meps.tsl.dsgn, AGE06X > 17), 
+   na.rm = TRUE)
```

## Statistical tests

Though most individual estimates are more easily compared using a
general difference formula, the `svyttest` function can be used to
conduct quick two-sample t-tests on any binary value that can be
generated in the data set. For example, to assess statistical
differences in health spending between adults in a particular census
region of the United States and adults living in all other regions, one
can rapidly create a binary variable to test for spending differences.

``` r
> #spending in northeast vs. others
> svyttest(TOTEXP06 ~ (cREGION06 == 1),
+   subset(meps.tsl.dsgn, AGE06X > 17 ))

> #spending in midwest vs. others
> svyttest(TOTEXP06 ~ (cREGION06 == 2),
+   subset(meps.tsl.dsgn, AGE06X > 17 ))
```

Using this method, any Boolean expression can be tested for differences
between groups. The examples below show that adults aged 45 to 54 do not
have significantly higher or lower spending than the set of all other
adults, while pre-retirees (aged 55 to 64r) do spend significantly more
than all other adults.

``` r
> #test 45-54 vs. all others
> svyttest(TOTEXP06 ~ (AGECAT == 4),
+   subset(meps.tsl.dsgn, AGE06X > 17))

> #test 55-64 vs. all others
> svyttest(TOTEXP06 ~ (cAGECAT == '55-64'), 
+   subset(meps.tsl.dsgn, AGE06X > 17 ))
```

# Conclusion

This article has outlined the capacity to prepare and accurately analyze
health policy data with complex survey designs using R. By highlighting
the necessary steps to transition from the proprietary statistical
package code provided in the technical documentation of the MEPS-HC
data, this article equips R users with the conversion knowledge required
to conduct important research on health policy data sets. The data
manipulation and analysis techniques proven to work on MEPS can be
generalized to the majority of available health policy data sets.

As a secondary goal behind contributing to the health policy analyst's
toolkit, this article has laid the groundwork for health-care survey
administration organizations to follow the lead of the National Center
for Health Statistics by including instructions and example code for R
in future versions of their technical documentation.[^12]
