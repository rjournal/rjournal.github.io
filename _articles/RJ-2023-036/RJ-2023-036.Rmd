# Introduction

The bootstrap introduced by [@Efron] is one of the most important
contemporary achievements of computational statistics. It has proven its
usefulness in various fields, e.g., in estimating standard errors,
computing confidence intervals, or hypothesis testing, especially if the
actual population distribution is unknown or the desired statistical
procedures are not tractable analytically, and when the sample size is
not large enough to apply asymptotic methods (e.g, [@EfroTibs93]). Then
[@gine] developed a bootstrapped approximation to the Central Limit
Theorem for generalized random elements, which allows to apply bootstrap
for fuzzy random variables used for modeling imprecise outputs of random
experiments. This application is of extreme importance because the
absence of suitable models for the distribution of fuzzy random
variables makes the statistical reasoning difficult. Practice has shown
that the use of the bootstrap to handle fuzzy data has been very
effective (e.g.,
[@gil; @gonzalezrodriguez; @montenegro2004; @LUBIANO2016918; @LUBIANO2017128]).

An important disadvantage of the classical bootstrap, easily spotted
especially for small sample sizes, is that the bootstrap samples almost
always contain repeated values and hence their variability is lower when
compared to the initial sample. This is more troublesome when the random
distribution of the assumed statistical model is continuous, since this
feature is not properly reflected with the classical bootstrap where
each value has the same non-zero probability of appearing in the
bootstrap sample. To overcome this problem many modifications of Efron's
approach were proposed in the literature, like the smoothed bootstrap
[@Silverman]. The same shortcomings and remarks apply to bootstrap
methods applied in a fuzzy environment. Here it would also be desirable
to generate samples consisting of fuzzy observations that are almost
identical to those contained in the original sample, but nevertheless
different from them to some extent. Several methods have been proposed
to deal with this problem [@GrzegorzewskiRom2021]. One can divide them
into two main groups. The first one group shares the generation of new
fuzzy numbers which keep some "characteristic points" of the membership
functions describing initial fuzzy values. For the second group, we are
interested in the preservation of some basic characteristics of the
initial values, like their canonical representation [@delgado]. Both
approaches seem to be fruitful in many aspects of the statistical
inference (see
[@grzegorzewski2019; @grzegorzewski_ijcis2020; @grzegorzewski_amcs2020; @GrzegorzewskiRom2021; @romaniuk2019; @romaniuk_hryniewicz])
and may be helpful in improving the results of some real-life data
analyses.

To allow potential users access to the aforementioned new bootstrap
methods, several resampling algorithms have been implemented in
[FuzzyResampling](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=FuzzyResampling)
package [@FuzzyResamplingMan]. They have been complemented by some
additional procedures which might be useful for the generation of
samples of trapezoidal fuzzy numbers, for estimation of the standard
error (or the MSE), and for testing hypotheses about the fuzzy mean (in
the single or two samples problem), etc. The proposed package can be
applied together with other tools designed for data analysis.
FuzzyResampling is, to our knowledge, the first package in R [@RMan]
which provides a few resampling methods for trapezoidal fuzzy numbers
together with some statistical functions based on them.

In the following, we briefly compare FuzzyResampling with the existing
packages, introduce a necessary notation and describe the new resampling
methods. Functions implemented in the package are illustrated with
examples. Finally, the proposed resampling methods are compared with the
classical bootstrap in some important statistical problems (both
theoretical and utilizing real-life data).

## Related packages

There is an abundance of packages oriented toward the classic bootstrap
and its statistical applications, like
[boot](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=boot) [@bootMan], with many
functions and data originated from [@davison_hinkley_1997] including the
parametric and nonparametric resampling approaches, or
[bootstrap](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=bootstrap)
[@bootstrapMan], which contains functions and data related to
[@EfroTibs93], e.g. cross-validation or jackknife procedures.

There are also many R packages intended to handle fuzzy numbers that may
be useful in statistical reasoning with fuzzy data. Researchers can
utilize [FuzzyNumbers](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=FuzzyNumbers)
[@FuzzyNumbersMan] for computing arithmetic operators, designing
approximations, and finding possibility and necessity values for
arbitrary fuzzy numbers or some of their special types.
[FuzzySTs](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=FuzzySTs) [@FuzzySTsMan]
might be helpful for fuzzification, calculation of different distances,
numerical estimations of fuzzy statistical measures and bootstrap
distribution of the likelihood ratio, etc. Such packages as
[SAFD](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=SAFD) [@Trutschnig2013] or
[Sim.PLFN](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=Sim.PLFN) [@SimPLFNMan]
are devoted to simulation on fuzzy numbers (see also [@COROIANU201326]
for additional details).

However, to our knowledge, FuzzyResampling is the only package that
provides the new resampling methods, different from Efron's classical
approach, for trapezoidal fuzzy numbers and lets users apply them to
various problems of statistical inference. In particular, SAFD provides
procedures for the bootstrapped versions of the one- or two-sample tests
for the mean of trapezoidal fuzzy numbers (which are related to the
C-test mentioned in this paper), but they are limited to the classical
bootstrap. Although it contains a function that generates stochastically
perturbated new values based on the input data frame, it only adds some
random noise without keeping track of important characteristics of the
input fuzzy numbers (as is done in the resampling methods implemented in
FuzzyResampling).

## Fuzzy numbers -- notation

For a more detailed introduction to the theory of fuzzy numbers, we
refer the reader to [@ban_coroianu_pg]. In the following, we provide
only some necessary concepts and notation.

A fuzzy number $A$ is characterized by its membership function $A(x)$
which represents the degree of membership of $x$ into $A$. We assume
that $0\leqslant A(x)\leqslant 1$, where $A(x)=1$ indicates that $x$
surely belongs to $A$, while $A(x)=0$ means that $x$ surely does not
belong to $A$. If $A(x)\in (0,1)$ then $x$ partially belongs to $A$.

Perhaps the most often used fuzzy numbers are known as the **trapezoidal
fuzzy numbers** (TPFNs) with their membership functions given by
$$A(x)=\begin{cases}
\frac{x-a_1}{a_2-a_1} & \text{if } a_1<x\leqslant a_2, \\
1 & \text{if } a_2\leqslant x\leqslant a_3, \\
\frac{a_4-x}{a_4-a_3} & \text{if } a_3\leqslant x<a_4, \\
0 & \text{otherwise},
\end{cases}
\label{eq:TPFN}$$ where $a_1,a_2,a_3,a_4\in\mathbb{R}$, and
$a_1\leqslant a_2\leqslant a_3\leqslant a_4$. Here, the interval
$[a_2,a_3]$, called the core, contains all values which are fully
compatible with the concept described by the fuzzy number $A$, while the
interval $[a_1,a_4]$, called the support, indicates all real values that
are compatible to some extent with $A$. If $A$ is a TPFN it can be
described completely using only four real values $a_1,a_2,a_3,a_4$, so
we can state $A=(a_1, a_2, a_3, a_4)$. If $a_2=a_3$ then we have a
**triangular fuzzy number** (TRFN), and $A = (a_1, a_2, a_4)$.

Another parametrization of a trapezoidal fuzzy number, which is
especially useful for generating fuzzy data and simulation studies, is
given by $$c  =\frac{a_2+a_3}{2}, \; 
s =\frac{a_3-a_2}{2}, \;
l =a_2-a_1, \;
r =a_4-a_3 ,
\label{eq:cslr}$$ where $c$ indicates the center of the core of a fuzzy
number, $s$ is equal to its core radius (the spread of the core), and
$l$ and $r$ stand for the spread of the left and the right arm of the
membership function $A(x)$, respectively. Of course, we have
$c\in\mathbb{R}$, and $s,l,r\geqslant 0$.

To introduce basic arithmetic operations (such as addition, subtraction,
etc.) for the fuzzy numbers, the Zadeh extension principle should be
applied (see [@ban_coroianu_pg]). However, in the case of TPFNs, some
operations are easier to conduct, e.g., for $A = (a_1, a_2, a_3, a_4)$
and $B = (b_1, b_2, b_3, b_4)$, we have
$$A + B = (a_1+b_1, a_2+b_2, a_3+b_3,a_4+b_4) ,$$ so the result is also
a TPFN.

## Resampling approaches for fuzzy data

Let $\widetilde{\mathbb{X}}=(\tilde{X}_1,\ldots,\tilde{X}_n)$ be a fuzzy
random sample [@puri1986] and
$\widetilde{\mathbbm{x}}=(\tilde{x}_1,\ldots,\tilde{x}_n)$ -- its actual
realization. This sample will be called the **primary sample** or the
**initial sample**. For the classical Effron's bootstrap, the bootstrap
samples (or **secondary samples**) are drawn randomly with replacement
from the primary sample. In this way we can create $b$ bootstrap samples
and the $i$-th element of the $j$-th secondary sample is denoted by
$\tilde{x}_{ij}^*$.

Because of the previously mentioned shortcomings of Efron's approach,
several modifications were proposed in the case of real-valued data. New
resampling methods for fuzzy data were introduced recently in
[@grzegorzewski2019; @grzegorzewski_ijcis2020; @grzegorzewski_amcs2020; @romaniuk2019; @romaniuk_hryniewicz].
All of them are implemented in FuzzyResampling package. We summarize
them briefly below. For a more detailed review, we refer the reader to
[@GrzegorzewskiRom2021].

The proposed approaches can be divided into two groups. In the first
one, following [\[eq:cslr\]](#eq:cslr){reference-type="eqref"
reference="eq:cslr"}, each TPFN $\tilde{x}_i$ is described by its
"characteristic points", like the left bound of the core
$lc_i= a_2 =c_i-s_i$, the core width $wc_i= a_3 - a_2 = 2s_i$, and the
spreads $l_i$ and $r_i$. Then, given a primary sample
$\widetilde{\mathbbm{x}}$, four sets are created:
$LC = \{ lc_1,\ldots,lc_n,\}$, $WC = \{ wc_1,\ldots,wc_n,\}$,
$L = \{ l_1,\ldots,l_n,\}$ and $R = \{ r_1,\ldots,r_n,\}$. If the
$\mathbf{d}$**-method** [@romaniuk_hryniewicz] is applied then four
numbers $lc^*, wc^*, l^*, r^*$ from the respective sets $LC, WC, L, R$
are drawn to construct a new bootstrapped element $\tilde{x}^*$. This
procedure is repeated $n$ times to obtain a whole secondary sample. For
the $\mathbf{w}$**-method** [@romaniuk_hryniewicz], instead of the equal
probabilities on the discrete sets, the special density $w(x)$ is used
to construct $x_i^*$. This leads to a more diversified secondary sample
than for the d-method. Both methods were also applied in [@8920048] for
interval-valued fuzzy numbers.

The second group of methods contains the following flexible bootstrap
algorithms: **VA-method** [@grzegorzewski2019; @grzegorzewski_amcs2020],
**EW-method** [@grzegorzewski_amcs2020], **VAF-method**
[@grzegorzewski_ijcis2020] and **VAA-method** [@GrzegorzewskiRom2021].
Contrary to $\mathbf{d}$**-method** or $\mathbf{w}$**-method**, flexible
approaches can be applied to primary samples of any fuzzy numbers, but
the generated outputs consist of TPFNs. However, the generated secondary
samples preserve the so-called canonical representations of the primary
observations. Our flexible methods differ in the type of preserved
representation, which is summarized in Table
[1](#tab101){reference-type="ref" reference="tab101"}.

Each of the flexible methods consists of four steps. Firstly, depending
on the particular method, some characteristics of fuzzy numbers -- like
the value $\mathrm{Val}(\tilde{x}_i)$, ambiguity
$\mathrm{Amb}(\tilde{x}_i)$ [@delgado], expected value
$\mathrm{EV}(\tilde{x}_i)$ (i.e. the middle point of the expected
interval of a fuzzy number [@Dubois; @Heilpern]), width
$\mathrm{w}(\tilde{x}_i)$ [@Chanas], fuzziness
$\mathrm{Fuzz} (\tilde{x}_i)$ [@delgado], left- and right-hand
ambiguities $\mathrm{Amb}_L (\tilde{x}_i), \mathrm{Amb}_U (\tilde{x}_i)$
-- are calculated for each observation $\tilde{x}_i$ of the primary
sample. What values are determined depends on the user's decision on
which values should be preserved during the generation of the bootstrap
samples. While some characteristics will be kept, others will be
randomly generated from the uniform distribution. Finally, the remaining
values describing a TPFN are directly calculated based on the formulas
depending on the resampling approach. In Table
[1](#tab101){reference-type="ref" reference="tab101"} we list some
flexible bootstrap methods along with an indication of which parameters
are preserved, which are randomly generated, and which are directly
calculated.

# Overview of FuzzyResampling package {#over}

Below we briefly discuss functions implemented in FuzzyResampling
package (version 0.6.0, available via CRAN). All further examples in R
can be self-repeated using a supplementary file.

## Generation of the initial sample {#genofinsa}

When the bootstrap is applied to solve any real-life problem the
provided data is automatically treated as the initial sample. However,
to perform any simulation study many synthetic samples are necessary, so
effective data generators from various distributions are then strongly
desirable. In the case of reasoning with imprecise data, we need an
algorithm which generates fuzzy numbers used for modeling such data. In
FuzzyResampling package two specialized functions to generate randomly
trapezoidal fuzzy numbers are available:

::: example
GeneratorNU (n, mu, sigma, a, b, increases = FALSE, \...)
GeneratorNExpUU (n, mu, sigma, lambda, b, c, increases = FALSE, \...)
:::

The third function, GeneratorFuzzyNumbers, can be used for various
random distributions describing the "true origin" of TPFN, the increases
of its core and the support. In this case, the respective functions
(e.g., rnorm) from stats package [@RMan], together with their
parameters' names, can be directly applied.

In both cases, to generate a TPFN, the parametrization described by
[\[eq:cslr\]](#eq:cslr){reference-type="eqref" reference="eq:cslr"} is
used. In particular, to obtain a single TPFN four values $c,s,l,r$ are
generated independently using random distributions described in Table
[2](#tab100){reference-type="ref" reference="tab100"}, where N(
mu,sigma) stands for the normal distribution with the mean mu and
standard deviation sigma, U (0, a) denotes the uniform distribution on
the interval (0, a), Exp ( lambda) stands for the exponential
distribution with the parameter lambda, etc. More details concerning
various types of simulated fuzzy numbers can be found in, e.g.,
[@grzegorzewski_ijcis2020; @10.1007/978-3-031-08974-9_39].

::: {#tab100}
  Function               $c$             $s$          $l$       $r$
  ----------------- -------------- --------------- --------- ---------
  GeneratorNU        N( mu,sigma)     U (0, a)      U(0, b)   U(0, b)
  GeneratorNExpUU    N( mu,sigma)   Exp ( lambda)   U(0, b)   U(0, c)

  : Distributions used to simulate fuzzy numbers.
:::

If we generate a sample of n fuzzy numbers using any of the considered
functions we receive the output as a matrix with n rows and four columns
corresponding to values $a_1, a_2, a_3, a_4$ defined in
[\[eq:TPFN\]](#eq:TPFN){reference-type="eqref" reference="eq:TPFN"}
(abbreviated further as "the ends") if the parameter increases is set to
FALSE, otherwise producing values $l, c-s, c+s, r$ described in
[\[eq:cslr\]](#eq:cslr){reference-type="eqref" reference="eq:cslr"}
(abbreviated further as "the increments"). It is worth noting that the
parameter increases plays the same role of indicating the form of the
output (or input) fuzzy numbers in all functions in this package.

As an example consider the following code generating a sample of $n=10$
trapezoidal fuzzy numbers in the "ends" mode, i.e. $a_1,a_2, a_3, a_4$:

::: example
\# seed PRNG \> set.seed(1234)

\> sample1 \<- GeneratorNU(10, mu = 0, sigma = 1, a = 0.2, b = 0.6) \>
head(sample1,2) \[,1\] \[,2\] \[,3\] \[,4\] \[1,\] -1.6023884 -1.2703882
-1.1158475 -1.0715795 \[2,\] -0.1709531 0.2168906 0.3304666 0.5162785
:::

## Resampling methods

To perform the classical Efron's bootstrap, the ClassicalBootstrap
function should be applied. Functions related to other methods (VA, EW,
etc.) have the common form XXXMethod, where XXX stands for the
respective method abbreviation. For instance, we write EWMethod in the
case of the EW approach. A general structure of these functions is
rather intuitive:

::: example
XXXMethod(initialSample, b = n, increases = FALSE)
:::

where initialSample denotes the name of a matrix of input fuzzy numbers,
b indicates the desired size of the bootstrap sample (if b is not
specified we assume it is equal to the initial sample $n$, i.e. the
number of rows in the input matrix), while with increases we set the
mode ("ends" or "increments") used for describing fuzzy numbers both in
the input and output matrices.

To generate the bootstrapped sample of $b=n=10$ values using the
classical Efron's approach based on the previously created initial
sample sample1:

::: example
\> set.seed(1234) \> \> sampleEfron \<- ClassicalBootstrap(sample1) \>
\> head(sampleEfron,2) \[,1\] \[,2\] \[,3\] \[,4\] \[1,\] -1.3584678
-0.8991919 -0.7285674 -0.2195319 \[2,\] 0.0427377 0.3439362 0.6579900
0.9603501
:::

Similarly, to perform the VA method for $b=20$:

::: example
\> set.seed(1234) \> \> sampleVA \<- VAMethod(sample1, 20) \> \>
head(sampleVA,2) \[,1\] \[,2\] \[,3\] \[,4\] \[1,\] -1.091883230
-1.0324841 -0.8074509 -0.06176483 \[2,\] 0.009038746 0.3607857 0.4974204
1.28148926
:::

## Calculation of the mid/spread distance

A distance between two fuzzy numbers often used in the statistical
context is the so-called mid/spread distance $D^{\lambda}_{\theta}$
proposed in [@Bertoluzza1995; @T09]. It can be designated by:

::: example
BertoluzzaDistance(fuzzyNumber1, fuzzyNumber2, theta = 1/3, increases =
FALSE)
:::

where fuzzyNumber1 and fuzzyNumber2 denote vectors containing the
respective fuzzy numbers, theta is the weight of the impact of the
distance between the mid-points of $\alpha$-cuts in contrast to the
distance between their spreads (usually theta=1/3 or theta=1).

To find the mid/spread distance between two fuzzy numbers from the
sample sample1 we apply:

::: example
\> BertoluzzaDistance(sample1\[1,\],sample1\[2,\]) \[1\] 1.488457
:::

## Estimation of SE/MSE

Bootstrap is often applied to estimate the standard error (SE) or the
mean squared error (MSE) of the considered estimator. If the resulting
estimator of the mean is given by a trapezoidal fuzzy number both SE and
MSE can be obtained with the following function:

::: example
SEResamplingMean(initialSample, resamplingMethod =
\"ClassicalBootstrap\", repetitions = 100, trueMean = NA, theta = 1/3,
increases = FALSE)
:::

where initialSample indicates a matrix containing the initial sample,
resamplingMethod denotes a resampling method, and repetitions stands for
the number of the bootstrap samples. If trueMean is not set then SE is
estimated by the formula $$\label{frachetse}
	\widehat{\mathrm{SE}}=\sqrt{\frac{1}{\text{repetitions}-1} \sum_{k=1}^{\text{repetitions}} D^2_{\theta} \Big( \bar{X}^{*i}, \bar{X}^{*}\Big)} ,$$
where $D_{\theta}$ is the mid/spread distance, while
$$\bar{X}^{*i} = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{j=1}^{n} X^{*ij}, \qquad \bar{X}^{*} = \frac{1}{\text{repetitions}} \sum_{i=1}^{\text{repetitions}} \bar{X}^{*i},$$
and where $X^{*ij}$ is the $j$-th fuzzy value in the $i$-th bootstrap
sample. Otherwise, MSE is estimated as follows $$\label{frachetmse}
	\widehat{\mathrm{MSE}}=\frac{1}{\text{repetitions}-1} \sum_{k=1}^{\text{repetitions}} D^2_{\theta} \Big( \bar{X}^{*i}, \mathbb{E}X\Big) ,$$
where $\mathbb{E}X$ is the Aumann-type mean [@puri1986] of the fuzzy
number given by trueMean expressed by the four values (depending on the
mode "ends" or "increments" specified in increases parameter).

To estimate SE using the classical bootstrap and the previously
generated sample1 we apply:

::: example
\> set.seed(1234) \> SEResamplingMean(sample1) $mean
[1] -0.70650791 -0.40296248 -0.22308095  0.05157294$SE \[1\] 0.05715056
:::

Here, mean is equal to $\bar{X}^{*}$ while SE gives
$\widehat{\mathrm{SE}}$.

On the other hand, the MSE based on the VA method can be estimated as
follows:

::: example
\> set.seed(1234) \> \> SEResamplingMean(sample1,resamplingMethod =
\"VAMethod\",trueMean = c(-0.4,-0.1,0.1,0.4)) $mean
[1] -0.4 -0.1  0.1  0.4$SE \[1\] 0.04421334
:::

where SE actually gives $\widehat{\mathrm{MSE}}$.

## Bootstrapped one-sample test for the mean

Bootstrap methods are often used in hypothesis testing with fuzzy data.
One of such tests, denoted further as the one-sample C-test
[@COLUBI2009344; @LUBIANO2016918], is designed to verify
$$\label{h0ctestw}
	H_0 : \mathbb{E} X = \mu_0 \quad\text{vs.}\quad H_1 : \mathbb{E} X \not = \mu_0 ,$$
where $\mu_0$ is a fixed fuzzy number assumed as the true fuzzy mean.
This test can be invoked with the following function:

::: example
OneSampleCTest(initialSample,mu_0,numberOfSamples = 100,theta = 1/3,
resamplingMethod = \"ClassicalBootstrap\",increases = FALSE)
:::

where initialSample is a matrix describing the initial sample, `mu_0` is
the hypothetical mean $\mu_0$, numberOfSamples is the number of
bootstrap samples and resamplingMethod specifies the resampling method.
As the output, we receive the estimated *p-value* which can be used to
make a final decision (i.e. to reject or not reject the null hypothesis
$H_0$).

To check whether the true mean of the population represented by sample1
is a TPFN $mu_0$ parametrized by $(-0.4,-0.1,0.1,0.4)$ we can apply the
C-test based on the classical bootstrap as follows:

::: example
\> set.seed(1234) \> OneSampleCTest(sample1, mu_0 =
c(-0.4,-0.1,0.1,0.4)) \[1\] 0.31
:::

To perform this test based on the VA method we apply:

::: example
\> set.seed(1234) \> \> OneSampleCTest(sample1, mu_0 =
c(-0.4,-0.1,0.1,0.4), + numberOfSamples = 1000, resamplingMethod =
\"VAMethod\") \[1\] 0.253
:::

In both cases, there is no reason to reject the null hypothesis because
the estimated p-values are greater than any reasonable significance
level (like the traditional 0.05).

## Bootstrapped two-sample test for the mean

A similar procedure can be applied to check whether there is a
significant difference between the means of the two independent fuzzy
samples. More precisely, we consider the two-sample C-test
[@LUBIANO2016918] to verify $$\label{h0ctestc2}
	H_0 : \mathbb{E} X_1 = \mathbb{E} X_2 \quad\text{vs.}\quad H_1 : \mathbb{E} X_1 \not = \mathbb{E} X_2 ,$$
where $\mathbb{E} X_1$ and $\mathbb{E} X_2$ are the Aumann-type means of
the first and second sample, respectively. Here the desired p-value can
be calculated by the following function

::: example
TwoSampleCTest(initialSample1,initialSample2,numberOfSamples = 100,
theta = 1/3,resamplingMethod = \"ClassicalBootstrap\",increases = FALSE)
:::

where initialSample1 and initialSample2 are matrices corresponding to
the first and the second initial sample, respectively, while other
parameters remain identical as for OneSampleCTest.

Given previously generated sample1 and sample2 simulated with a slight
shift (i.e. for mu = 0.2) we verify
[\[h0ctestc2\]](#h0ctestc2){reference-type="eqref"
reference="h0ctestc2"} using the two-sample C-test based on the
classical bootstrap. Thus we type the following commands:

::: example
\> set.seed(1234) \> sample2 \<- GeneratorNU(10, mu = 0.2, sigma = 1, a
= 0.2, b = 0.6) \> \> TwoSampleCTest(sample1, sample2,numberOfSamples =
1000) \[1\] 0.678
:::

Thus obtaining such a high p-value there is no reason to reject $H_0$.

# Comparison of the resampling methods with FuzzyResampling package

Now we numerically compare the introduced resampling methods with the
classical bootstrap using various statistical approaches like the
standard error estimation or the power analysis.

## Method comparison with SE/MSE

To compare the statistical properties of the considered resampling
methods we firstly use SE/MSE for the mean. In some papers, it is stated
that the proposed new resampling methods usually have smaller errors
than the classical bootstrap
[@grzegorzewski_amcs2020; @grzegorzewski_ijcis2020; @GrzegorzewskiRom2021].
To check this, one may use the following SEResamplingMean function

::: example
ComparisonSEMean (generator, sampleSize = 10, numberOfSamples = 100,
repetitions = 100,trueMean = NA, theta = 1/3, \...)
:::

where generator indicates the algorithm applied to simulate fuzzy
numbers (see Tab. [2](#tab100){reference-type="ref"
reference="tab100"}), \... specifies some additional parameters required
by generator and numberOfSamples stands for the number of experiment
repetitions performed to minimize the undesired influence of random
fluctuations.

To estimate SE for a small (e.g. $n=10$) or moderate (e.g. $n=50$)
initial sample size we proceed as follows:

::: example
\> set.seed(1234567)

\> outputSEsample3 \<- ComparisonSEMean(generator =
\"GeneratorNExpUU\",sampleSize = 10, + numberOfSamples =
10000,repetitions = 100,mu = 0,sigma = 4,lambda = 4,b = 0.4,c = 0.8)

\> round(outputSEsample3, digits = 5)

ClassicalBootstrap VAMethod EWMethod VAFMethod DMethod WMethod VAAMethod
0.10756 0.10757 0.10753 0.10751 0.10763 0.10664 0.10764
:::

As it can be seen the estimated SE for the new resampling methods may be
significantly lower (about¬†1%) than for the classical bootstrap. These
results confirm the remarks given in [@GrzegorzewskiRom2021] that "the
w-method is usually the best approach for small sample sizes, while the
VAF-method is the best for moderate and big samples. In general, when
considering various models, it appears that the VAF-method and EW-method
behave in a rather stable manner, while the behavior of the VAA-method
depends strongly on the type of data." Some other examples can be found
in the supplemental file.

A similar comparison of the bootstrap methods can be done using the MSE:

::: example
\> set.seed(1234567)

\> outputMSEsample2 \<- ComparisonSEMean(generator =
\"GeneratorNExpUU\",sampleSize = 10, + numberOfSamples = 10000,
repetitions = 100, trueMean = c(-0.45,-0.25,0.25,0.65), + mu = 0, sigma
= 4, lambda = 4, b = 0.4, c = 0.8)

\> round(outputMSEsample1, digits = 5)

ClassicalBootstrap VAMethod EWMethod VAFMethod DMethod WMethod VAAMethod
0.16495 0.16499 0.16482 0.16470 0.16496 0.16315 0.16519
:::

Here the relative difference is about 1.1% if the w-method is compared
with the classical bootstrap.

## Test size estimation

We can also compare the empirical size (i.e. the maximal percentage of
rejections if the null hypothesis holds) of the one-sample C-test based
on different resampling approaches (see also
[@grzegorzewski_ijcis2020]). To proceed with such a study, the following
special function based on OneSampleCTest is available:

::: example
ComparisonOneSampleCTest (generator,mu_0,shift=0,sampleSize =
10,numberOfSamples = 10, initialSamples = 100,theta = 1/3,significance =
0.05, \...)
:::

It generates a sequence of initial samples (their number is given in
initialSamples and the size is determined by sampleSize) for fuzzy
numbers of the type specified by generator. Then some deterministic
shift of the size shift is added to each fuzzy observation in these
samples. Next, the function OneSampleCTest is executed to calculate the
p-value for each combination of the initial sample and resampling
method. Then, by comparing the p-value with the assumed significance
level significance we make a decision whether to reject the null
hypothesis $H_0$ specified in
[\[h0ctestw\]](#h0ctestw){reference-type="eqref" reference="h0ctestw"}
or not. The output of this procedure is the percentage of rejections in
the sequence of experiments. To estimate the test size one should set
shift=0. All other parameters of this function are passed to
OneSampleCTest or the respective generator.

Let us consider the following simulation experiment:

::: example
\> set.seed(1234567)

\> outputCSizetest1 \<-
ComparisonOneSampleCTest(generator=\"GeneratorNU\", + mu_0 =
c(-0.4,-0.1,0.1,0.4), sampleSize = 10,numberOfSamples = 100, +
initialSamples = 1000,mu = 0, sigma = 1,a = 0.2,b = 0.6)

\> round(outputCSizetest1, digits = 4)

ClassicalBootstrap VAMethod EWMethod VAFMethod DMethod WMethod VAAMethod
0.038 0.035 0.040 0.035 0.037 0.040 0.034

\# check the distance to the \"true value\" 0.05 \>
round(outputCSizetest1-0.05, digits = 4)

ClassicalBootstrap VAMethod EWMethod VAFMethod DMethod WMethod VAAMethod
-0.012 -0.015 -0.010 -0.015 -0.013 -0.010 -0.016
:::

It can be seen that the empirical sizes of the C-test combined with the
new resampling methods might be closer to the assumed significance level
of 0.05 than obtained for Efron's bootstrap. Some other examples can be
found in the supplemental file. The plot showing the estimated
percentage of rejections as a function of the significance level is
shown in Fig. [\[fig1size\]](#fig1size){reference-type="ref"
reference="fig1size"}. Because the distance between these two values
(i.e. the percentage of rejections and the significance level) is
usually low, the respective differences are additionally plotted in Fig.
[1](#fig2size){reference-type="ref" reference="fig2size"} for all the
resampling methods.

<embed src="size_plot_1_v2.pdf" />
<embed src="size_plot_2_v2.pdf" />
<figcaption>Differences in test size between the resampling methods and
the significance level.</figcaption>
</figure>

Our experiments confirm the conclusion stated in
[@grzegorzewski_amcs2020] that the classical bootstrap was never the
winner in such comparisons. New resampling methods usually behave much
better -- especially the $d$-method and the VA-method. The EW-method
behaves always in a relatively stable manner and never drops below the
third place.

## Test power analysis

Our package also enables the power comparison for the one-sample C-test
combined with different resampling methods. This is possible by using
the ComparisonOneSampleCTest function, which determines the percentage
of the null hypothesis rejection under increasing shift added to the
initial sample:

::: example
ComparePowerOneSampleCTest (generator,mu_0,shiftVector,sampleSize = 10,
numberOfSamples = 10,initialSamples = 100,theta = 1/3,significance =
0.05, \...)
:::

This procedure produces a matrix with the successive shift values, set
in the vector shiftVector, specified in the rows and the corresponding
percentages of rejections for the respective resampling methods given in
columns.

Below we show how to apply this function to comparisons based on very
small samples ($n=5$). To minimize undesired random effects the
following experiment was repeated 10000 times:

::: example
\# prepare vector of shifts \> shifts \<- seq(0.1,1,by = 0.05)

\> set.seed(1234567)

\> outputCPowerTest1 \<-
ComparePowerOneSampleCTest(generator=\"GeneratorNU\", + mu_0 =
c(-0.4,-0.1,0.1,0.4),shiftVector = shifts,sampleSize = 5,numberOfSamples
= 100, + initialSamples = 10000,mu = 0,sigma = 1,a = 0.2,b = 0.6)

\> head(round(outputCPowerTest1, digits = 4),4)

ClassicalBootstrap VAMethod EWMethod VAFMethod DMethod WMethod VAAMethod
0.1 0.0274 0.0302 0.0305 0.0314 0.0288 0.0276 0.0278 0.15 0.0278 0.0321
0.0321 0.0305 0.0304 0.0293 0.0297 0.2 0.0315 0.0357 0.0337 0.0325

0.0366
:::

The results given both in the output matrix and in
Fig.¬†[\[fig1power\]](#fig1power){reference-type="ref"
reference="fig1power"} show that the new resampling methods have greater
power than the classical bootstrap approach. To better highlight the
results, differences between the power curves for each of the new
resampling methods and Efron's bootstrap are plotted in Fig.
[2](#fig2power){reference-type="ref" reference="fig2power"}. Observing
these results we can agree with the conclusions of simulations reported
in [@GrzegorzewskiRom2021], that "In general (i.e. including other
models) this method *(VA-method)* was usually one of the best,
especially for smaller sample sizes or a lower number of bootstrap
replications (e.g. $b=100$). The VAA-method or the EW-method were
usually just after VA-method; the d-method, w- and the VAA-method were
neither too good nor too bad, but the classical bootstrap (as compared
with other resampling methods) was usually the worse method in
hypotheses testing."

## Two-sample test -- a real-life case

Finally, we compare the resampling methods combined with the two-sample
C-test applied to some real-life imprecise data. Such data may appear
naturally wherever we deal with expert opinions expressed in everyday
language. In our study, we consider the opinions of the experts related
to the Gamonedo cheese quality (a kind of blue cheese produced in
Asturias, Spain). The inherently imprecise assessments were modeled by
the TPFNs [@ramos2019].

To check whether two given experts, say A and C, differ significantly in
their opinions, we verify the null hypothesis
[\[h0ctestc2\]](#h0ctestc2){reference-type="eqref"
reference="h0ctestc2"} of no difference [@grzegorzewski_amcs2020]. We
can perform the desired test using the following function based on
TwoSampleCTest:

::: example
CompareRealCaseTwoSample(numberOfSamples, numberOfIterations)
:::

which delivers p-values of the two-sample C-test for all resampling
methods. To eliminate undesired randomness each experiment (i.e. the
bootstrap procedure for the single test) is repeated numberOfIterations
times and then the obtained p-values are averaged. The parameter
numberOfSamples is passed directly to TwoSampleCTest.

Then the following function is applied:

::: example
\> set.seed(1234567) \> realCaseP \<-
CompareRealCaseTwoSample(numberOfSamples=100,numberOfIterations=10000)
\> \> round(realCaseP,5) ClassicalBootstrap VAMethod EWMethod VAFMethod
DMethod WMethod VAAMethod 0.82055 0.91213 0.88388 0.85542 0.82179
0.82212 0.85455
:::

Assuming any reasonable significance level, the null hypothesis $H_0$ is
not rejected. Thus, whichever resampling method is applied, we may
conclude that the given two experts do not differ significantly in their
opinions. However, the new resampling methods usually lead to greater
p-values than the classical bootstrap (i.e. we are "more sure" that
$H_0$ can be accepted).

# Conclusions

The main goal of the proposed resampling algorithms for fuzzy samples of
trapezoidal fuzzy numbers is to overcome the shortcomings typical to the
classical bootstrap. New approaches are implemented in FuzzyResampling
package and are supplemented with some ready-to-use functions useful in
statistical inference based on imprecise data. It is shown that, in some
cases analyzed in this paper and related literature, the suggested
bootstrap algorithms are more effective than the classical one.

Obviously, many problems are still open. New methods and algorithms that
would be helpful in solving many problems faced by practitioners are
still needed. In particular, an in-depth study on the so-called
"epistemic bootstrap" [@grzegorzewski2021] would be useful to handle
"epistemic data" instead of the "ontic data" [@Couso2014] discussed in
this paper.
