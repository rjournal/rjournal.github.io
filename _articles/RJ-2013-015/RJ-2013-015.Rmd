title: 'mpoly: Multivariate Polynomials in R'
abstract: The mpoly package is a general purpose collection of tools for symbolic
  computing with multivariate polynomials in R. In addition to basic arithmetic, mpoly
  can take derivatives of polyno mials, compute Gr√∂bner bases of collections of polynomials,
  and convert polynomials into a functional form to be evaluated. Among other things,
  it is hoped that mpoly will provide an R-based foundation for the computational
  needs of algebraic statisticians.
