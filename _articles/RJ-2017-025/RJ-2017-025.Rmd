title: 'autoimage: Multiple Heat Maps for Projected Coordinates'
abstract: 'Heat maps are commonly used to display the spatial distribution of a response
  observed on a two-dimensional grid. The autoimage package provides convenient functions
  for constructing multiple heat maps in unified, seamless way, particularly when
  working with projected coordinates. The autoimage package natively supports: 1.
  automatic inclusion of a color scale with the plotted image, 2. construction of
  heat maps for responses observed on regular or irregular grids, as well as non-gridded
  data, 3. construction of a matrix of heat maps with a common color scale, 4. construction
  of a matrix of heat maps with individual color scales, 5. projecting coordinates
  before plotting, 6. easily adding geographic borders, points, and other features
  to the heat maps. After comparing the autoimage packageâ€™s capabilities for constructing
  heat maps to those of existing tools, a carefully selected set of examples is used
  to highlight the capabilities of the autoimage package.'
