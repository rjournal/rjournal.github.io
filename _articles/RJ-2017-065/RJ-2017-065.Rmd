# Introduction

The Rocker project was launched in October 2014 as a collaboration
between the authors to provide high-quality Docker images containing the
R environment [@edd2014]. Since that time, the project has seen both
considerable uptake in the community and substantial development and
evolution. Here we seek to document the project's objectives and uses.

### What is Docker?

Docker is a popular open-source tool to create, distribute, deploy, and
run software applications using *containers*. Containers provide a
virtual environment (see @Clark2014 for an overview of common virtual
environments) requiring all operating-system components an application
needs to run. Docker containers are lightweight as they share the
operating system kernel, start instantly using a layered filesystem
which minimizes disk footprint and download time, are built on open
standards that run on all major platforms (Linux, Mac, Windows), and
provide an added layer of security by running an application in an
isolated environment [@what-docker]. Familiarity with a few key terms is
helpful in understanding this paper. The term "container" refers to an
isolated software environment on a computer. R users can think of
running a container as analogous to loading an R package; a container is
an active instance of a static Docker image. A Docker "image" is a
binary archive of that software, analogous to an R binary package: a
given version is downloaded only once, and can then be "run" to create a
container whenever it is needed. A "Dockerfile" is a recipe, the
source-code, to create a Docker image. Pre-built Docker images are
publicly available through Docker Hub, which plays a role for central
distribution similar to CRAN in our analogy. Development and
contributions to the Rocker project focus on the construction,
organization and maintenance of these Dockerfiles.

# Design principles and use cases

Docker gives users very convenient access to pre-configured and
pre-built *binary* images that "just work". This allows R users to
access a wider-variety of ready-to-use environments than provided by
either the R Project itself or, say, their distribution which will
generally focus on one (current) release. For example, R users on
Windows may run RStudio Server or Shiny Server locally just by launching
a single command (once Docker itself is installed). Another common
use-case is access to R-devel without affecting the local system. Here,
we detail some of the principal use cases motivating these containerized
versions of R environments, and the design principles that help make
them work.

### Portability: From laptop to cloud

One common use case for Rocker containers is to provide a fast and
reliable mechanism to deploy a custom R environment to a remote server,
such as Amazon Web Services Elastic Compute (AWS EC2), DigitalOcean,
NSF's Jetstream servers [@jetstream], or private or institutional server
hardware. Rocker containers are also easy to run locally on most modern
laptops using Windows, MacOS, or Linux-based operating systems. By
sharing volumes with the local host, users can still manipulate files
with familiar, native tools while performing computation through a
reproducible, containerized environhment [@Boettiger2015]. Being able to
test code in a predictable, pre-configured R environment on a local
machine and to then run the same code in an identical environment on a
remote server (*e.g.*, for access to greater RAM, more processors, or
merely to free up the local machine from a long-running computation) is
essential for low-friction scaling of analysis. Without such
containerization, getting code to run appropriately in a remote
environment can be a major undertaking, requiring both time and
knowledge many would-be users may not have.

For instance, on any platform with Docker installed, the following
Docker command will launch a Rocker container providing the RStudio
server environment over a web interface.

``` r
wget -qO- https://get.docker.com/ | sh 
sudo docker run -p 8787:8787 -e PASSWORD=<PICK-A-PASSWORD> rocker/rstudio
```

The `docker run` option `-p` sets the port on which RStudio will appear,
for which 8787 is the default (adding your user to the docker group
avoids the need for a `sudo` command to call `docker`:
`sudo usermod -g docker $USER`). Many academic and commercial cloud
providers make it possible to execute such code snippets when a
container is launched, without ever needing to `ssh` into the machine.
The user may log into the server merely by pasting its IP address or DNS
name (followed by the chosen port, *e.g.*, `:8787`) into a browser and
entering the appropriate password. This provides the user with a
familiar, interactive environment running on a remote machine while
requiring a minimum of expertise.

This portability is also valuable in an instructional context. Requiring
students to install all necessary software on personal laptops can be
particularly challenging for short workshops, where download and
installation time and troubleshooting across heterogeneous machines can
prove time consuming and frustrating for students and instructors alike.
By deploying a Rocker image or Rocker-derived image (see
*Extensibility*) on a cloud machine, an instructor can easily provide
all students access to the pre-configured software environment using
only the browser on their laptops. This strategy has proven effective in
our own experience in both workshops and semester-length courses.
Similar Docker-based cloud deployments have been scaled to courses of
100s of students, *e.g.*, at Duke [@Mine] and UC Berkeley [@data8].

## HPC application

The portability of Rocker images can be particularly valuable in High
Performance Computing contexts Setting up a specific R environment on
High Performance Computing platforms and other centrally administrated
multi-user machines or clusters has traditionally been challenging due
to restrictions on root access that may be needed to install certain
libraries. Versions of R and packages installed by the system
administrator may also lag behind the most recent releases. Deploying
Docker containers on HPC systems has previously been more very
problematic since most system administrators do not want to allow the
elevated user permissions the Docker runtime environment requires. To
work around this problem, Lawrence Berkeley National Labs (LBNL) has
made 'Singularity' [@singularity]: a container runtime environment that
users can both install and use to run most Docker containers without
requiring root privileges. Singularity has seen rapid adoption in the
HPC community (<http://singularity.lbl.gov/install-request>). Rocker
containers can be run through Singularity with a single command much
like the native Docker commands, *e.g.*

``` r
singularity exec docker://rocker/tidyverse:latest R
```

More details can be found in the Singularity documentation.

### Interfaces

An important aspect of the Rocker project design is the ability for
users to interact with the software on the container through either an
interactive shell session (such as the R shell or a bash shell), or
through a web browser accessing the RStudio(R) Server integrated
development environment (IDE). Traditional remote and high-performance
computing workflows for R users have usually required the use of `ssh`
and a terminal-only interface, posing a challenge for interactive
graphics and a barrier to users unfamiliar with these tools and
environments. Accessing an RStudio container through the browser removes
these barriers. Rocker images include the RStudio-server software
pre-installed and configured with the explicit permission of RStudio
Inc.

Users can access a `bash` shell running as root within a Rocker
container using

``` r
docker exec -ti <container-id> bash
```

which can be useful for administrative tasks such as installing system
dependencies. All Rocker images can also be run as an interactive R,
RScript or bash shell without running RStudio, which can be useful for
batch jobs or for anyone who prefers that environment.

As with any interactive Docker container, users should specify the
terminal (`-t`) and interactive (`-i`) flags, (here combined with
interactive as `-ti`), and specify the desired executable environment
(*e.g.*, `R`, though other common options could be `Rscript` or `bash`):

``` r
docker run --rm -ti rocker/tidyverse R
```

This example shows the use of the `--rm` flag to indicate that the
container should be removed when the interactive session is finished.
Details on sharing volumes, managing user permissions, and more can be
found on the Rocker website, <https://rocker-project.org>.

### Sandboxed

Another feature of Rocker containers is the ability to provide a
sandboxed environment, isolated from software and potentially from other
data on the machine. Many users are reluctant to upgrade their suite of
installed packages, which may break their existing code or even their R
environment if the installation goes poorly. However, upgrading packages
and/or the R environment is often necessary to run analyses from a
colleague, or access more recent methods. Rocker offers an easy
solution. For instance, a user can run R code requiring the most recent
versions of R and related packages inside a Rocker container without
having to upgrade their local installations first. Conversely, one could
use Rocker to run code on an older R release with prior versions of R
packages, again without having to make any alteration to one's local R
install. Another common use case is to access a container with support
for particular options such as using gcc or clang compiler sanitizers
[@edd_sanitizers]. These require R itself be built with specialized
settings that may not be not available or familiar to many R users on
their native system, but can be easily deployed by pulling the Rocker
images `rocker/r-devel-san` or `rocker/r-devel-ubsan-clang`.

This sandboxing feature is also valuable in the remote computing
context, allowing system administrators to grant users freedom to
install software which requires root privileges inside a container,
while not granting them root access on the host machine. Root access is
required to launch Docker containers, though not to access containers
already running and providing some service such as RStudio. Users
logging into a container through the RStudio interface do not by default
have root privileges, though are able to install R packages. Granting
these users root privileges in the container still leaves them sandboxed
from the host container. Sandboxing also serves an important function in
reproducible research by making it easier to test a specified
environment in isolation from the host machine. Unlike traditional
virtual machines, containers do not impose a large footprint of reserved
resources as a typical host can easily support 100s of containers
[@what-docker].

### Transparent

Users can easily determine the software stack installed on any Rocker
image by examining the associated Dockerfile recipe, which provides a
concise, human-readable record of the installation. All Rocker images
use automated builds through Docker Hub, which also acts as the central,
default repository distributing the images. Using automated builds
rather than uploading pre-built image binaries to Docker Hub avoids the
potential for the build not to match the recipe. The corresponding
Dockerfile is visible both on the Docker Hub and in the linked GitHub
repository, which provides a transparent versioned history of all
changes made to these recipes, as well as documentation, a community
wiki, and issue trackers for discussing proposed changes, bugs,
improvements to the Dockerfiles and troubleshoot any issues users may
encounter. Having these public source files built automatically by a
trusted provider (Docker Hub), rather than built locally and uploaded as
binaries, is also useful from a security perspective in avoiding
malware.

### Community optimized

Having a shared, transparent computational environment created by a
publicly hosted, reproducible recipe facilitates community input into
configuration details. R and many of its packages and related software
can be configured with a wide range of options, compilers, different
linear-algebra libraries and so forth. While this flexibility reflects
varying needs, many users rely on default settings which are most often
are optimized more for simplicity of installation rather than than
performance. The Rocker recipes reflect significant community input on
these choices. This helps create a more finely tuned, optimized
reference implementation of the R environment as well as a platform for
comparing and discussing these concerns which are often overlooked
elsewhere. Issues and Pull Requests on the Rocker repositories on GitHub
attest to some of these discussions and improvements. In particular,
input from the Docker Inc. employees through the official approval
process for the `r-base` image, expertise from the Debian R maintainer
and other Debian developers, and both direct and indirect feedback from
the experience and user-generated documentation from many early adopters
in the R community has helped shape and strengthen the project over the
past few years. Widespread use of the Rocker image helps promote both
testing of these choices and contributions, further tweaking the
configuration from many members of the R community.

### Versioned

Access to specific versions of software can be important for users who
need computational reproducibility more than having the latest release
of any piece of software, since subsequent releases can alter the
behavior of code, introduce errors or otherwise alter previous results.
The versioned stack (`r-ver`, `rstudio`, `tidyverse`, `verse`, and
`geospatial`) provides images which are intended to build an identical
software stack every time, regardless of the release of new libraries
and packages. Users should specify an R version tag in the Docker image
name to request a version stable image, *e.g.*, `rocker/verse:3.4.0`. If
no tag is explicitly requested, Docker will provide the image with the
tag `:latest`, which will always have the latest available versions of
the software (built nightly).

Users building on the version-tagged images will by default use the MRAN
snapshot mirror [@MRAN] associated with the most recent date for which
that image was current. This ensures that a Dockerfile building
`FROM rocker/verse:3.4.1` will only install R package versions that were
available on CRAN on 2017-06-30, *i.e.*, the day R 3.4.1 was released.
This default can of course be overwritten in the standard R manner,
*e.g.*, by specifying a different CRAN mirror explicitly in any command
to install packages, *e.g.*, `install.packages()`, or by adjusting the
default CRAN mirror in `options(repo=<CRAN-MIRROR>)` in an `.Rprofile`.
Note that the MRAN date associated with the current release (*e.g.*,
`3.4.2` at the time of writing) will continue to advance on the
Docker-hub image until the next R release. Software installed from
`apt-get` in these images will come from the the stable Debian release
(`stretch` or `jessie`) and thus not change versions (though it will
receive security patches). Packages installed from BioConductor using
the `bioclite()` utility will also install the version appropriate to
the version of R found on the system (the Bioconductor semi-annual
release model avoids the need for an MRAN mirror). Users installing
packages from GitHub or other sources can request a specific git release
tag or hash for a more reproducible build, or adopt an alternative
approach such as [*packrat*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=packrat)
[@packrat]. A more general discussion of the use and limitations of
Docker for computational reproducibility can be found in
[@Boettiger2015].

### Extensible

Any portable computational environment faces an inevitable tension
between the "kitchen sink problem" at one extreme, and the "discovery
problem" on the other. A kitchen sink image seeks to accommodate too
many use cases in a single image. Such images are inevitably very large
and thus slow or difficult to deploy, maintain and optimize. At the
other extreme, providing too many specialized images makes it more
difficult for a user to discover the one they need. The Rocker project
seeks to avoid both of these problems by providing a carefully-curated
suite of images that an be easily extended by individuals and
communities.

To make extensions transparent and persistent, Rocker images can be
extended by any user by writing their own Dockerfiles based on an
appropriate Rocker image. The Dockerfiles in the Rocker stack should
themselves provide a simple example of this, (as described in the
following section). A user begins by selecting an appropriate base image
for their needs: if the RStudio interface is desired, a user might start
with `FROM rocker/rstudio`; an image for testing an R package with
compiled code might use `FROM rocker/r-devel-san`, and an image for
reproducing a data analysis will probably select a stable version tag in
addition to an appropriate base library, *e.g.*,:
`FROM rocker/tidyverse:3.4.1`. Users can easily add additional software
to any running Rocker image using the standard R and Debian mechanisms.
Details on how to extend Rocker images can be found at
<https://rocker-project.org>.

Sharing these Dockerfiles can also facilitate the emergence of
extensions tuned to particular communities. For instance, the
`rocker/geospatial` image emerged from the input of a number of Rocker
users all adding common geospatial libraries and packages on top of the
existing Rocker images. This coalescence helped create a more fine-tuned
image with broad support for a wide range of commonly-used data formats
and libraries. Other community images are developed and maintained
independently of the Rocker project, such as the `popgen` image of
population-genetics-oriented software developed by the National
Evolutionary Synthesis Center (NESCent). Rocker images are also being
used as base Docker images in the NSF sponsored Whole Tale project for
reproducible computing [@wholetale], and are heavily used by the
[*rhub*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=rhub) project in automated
package testing [@rhub].

# Rocker organization and workflow

The Rocker project consists of a suite of images built automatically by
and hosted on the Docker Hub, <https://hub.docker.com/r/rocker>. Source
Dockerfiles, supporting scripts and documentation are hosted on GitHub
under the organization `rocker-org`, <https://github.com/rocker-org>.
The issue tracker and pull requests are used for community input,
discussions, and contributions to these images. The Rocker project wiki,
<https://github.com/rocker-org/rocker/wiki>, provides a place to
synthesize community-contributed documentation, use-cases, and other
knowledge about using the Rocker images.

### Images in the Rocker Project

The Rocker project aims to provide a small core of Docker images that
serve as convenient 'base' images on which other users can build custom
R environments by writing their own Dockerfiles, while also providing a
'batteries included' approach to images that can be used out of the box.
The challenges of balancing diverse needs driven by very different use
cases against the overarching goals of creating images that are still
sufficiently light-weight, easy to use, and easy to maintain is a
difficult art. The implementation in both individual Rocker images and
image stacks can never perfect that balance for everyone, but today
reflects the considerable community input and testing over the past few
years.

All Rocker images are based on the Debian Linux distribution. It
provides a small base image, the well-known `apt` package management
system, and a rich ecosystem of software libraries, making it the base
image of choice for Docker images, including many of the "official"
images maintained by Docker's own development team. The Debian platform
is also perhaps the best-supported Linux platform within the R
community, including an active `r-sig-debian` listserve. The relatively
long period between stable Debian releases (roughly two years recently)
means that software in the Debian stable (*e.g.*, `debian:jessie`,
`debian:stretch`) releases can lag significantly behind current releases
of popular software, including R. More recent versions of packages can
be found in the pre-release distribution, `debian:testing`, while the
very latest binary builds can be found on `debian:unstable`. The Rocker
project can be largely divided into two stacks which address different
needs, reflected in which Debian distribution they are based on. The
first stack is based on `debian:testing`. The second, more
recently-introduced stack, is based only on Debian stable releases.
Rocker images always point to specific stable releases (`jessie`,
`stretch`), and do not use the tag `debian:stable`, which is a rolling
tag that always points to the most recent stable version. The different
Rocker stacks have different aims and thus provide different images, as
shown in Tables 1 & 2 below.

### The `debian:testing`-based images

The `debian:testing` stack aims to make the most efficient use of
upstream builds: the pre-compiled `.deb` binaries provided by the Debian
repositories. It is both quicker and easier to install software from
binaries, since the package manager (`apt`) manages the necessary
(binary) dependencies and bypasses the time-consuming process of
compiling from source. Basing this stack on `debian:testing` means that
much more recent versions of commonly-used libraries and compilers are
available as binaries than would be found in a Debian stable release. In
order to provide *optional* access to the most recent available
binaries, this stack uses apt-pinning [@apt_pinning] to allow the `apt`
package manager to *selectively* install binaries from
`debian:unstable`, which represents the most recent set of packages
built for Debian. Similarly, recent versions of many popular R packages
can also be installed pre-built through the package manager, *e.g.*,
`apt-get install r-cran-xml`. This can be particularly helpful for
packages with external system dependencies (such as `libxml2-dev` in
this example) which cannot be installed from the R console as they are
system dependencies rather than R packages installed from within R. We
should note, however, that only about 500 of the over 11,000 CRAN
packages are available as Debian packages.

As the names `testing` and `unstable` imply, particular versions of
package can change as packages move from `unstable` into `testing`. New
versions are sent to `unstable` during the normal course of Debian
development. This can occasionally break a previously-working
installation command in a Dockerfile until the maintainer redirects the
package manager to install a package from the `unstable` sources that
could previously be installed from `testing`, or vice versa (using the
`-t` option in `apt`). That said, packages only migrate from `unstable`
to `testing` after a period of several days---and if the migration and
installation of the particular version is free of interactions with
other packages in their dependency graph. That way, `unstable` serves as
validation lab which leaves `testing` reasonably stable yet current.

Relative to `stable`, the `testing` stack thus offers some advantages as
almost all software can be installed through the package manager.
Installation of binary packages from `testing` generally provides the
most recent available software, and installs it quickly as a binary. On
the other hand, these Dockerfiles may require occasional maintenance
when packages migrate and/or versions change. The resulting images are
also inherently dynamic: rebuilding the same Dockerfile months or years
apart will generate images with significantly different versions of
software installed as the pool of underlying packages changes through
time.

### Images overview

The `debian:testing`-based stack currently includes seven images
actively maintained by the Rocker development team (Table 1). `r-base`
builds on `debian:testing`, and the other six in the stack each build
directly from `r-base`. The `r-base` image is unique in that it is
designated as the official image for the R language by the Docker
organization itself. This official image is reviewed and then built by
employees of Docker Inc. based on a Dockerfile maintained by the Rocker
team. Consequently, users should refer to this image in Docker commands
without an organization namespace, *e.g.*, `docker run -ti r-base` to
access the official image. All other images in the Rocker project are
not individually reviewed and built by Docker Inc. and must be
referenced using the `rocker` namespace, *e.g.*,
`docker run -ti rocker/r-devel`.

Several of the images in this stack are oriented towards the R
development community: `r-devel`, `drd`, `r-devel-san`, and
`r-devel-ubsan-clang` which all add a copy of the development version of
R side-by-side to the current release of R provided by `r-base`. On
these images, the development version is aliased to `RD` to distinguish
from the current release, `R`. As the names suggest, each provide
slightly different configurations. Of particular interest are the images
providing development R built with support for C/C++ address and
undefined-behavior sanitizers, which are somewhat difficult to configure
[@edd_sanitizers].

As these images focus on developers and/or as base images for custom
uses, this stack does not include many specific R packages. Additional
dependencies and packages can easily be installed from `apt`. R packages
not available in the `apt` repositories can be installed directly from
CRAN using either `R` or the `littler` scripts, as described in
<https://rocker-project.org/use>.

This stack also includes the images `shiny` and `rstudio:testing` that
provide Shiny server and RStudio server IDE from RStudio Inc, built on
the `r-base` image. RStudio and Shiny are registered trademarks of
RStudio Inc, and their use and the distribution of their software in
binary form on Docker Hub has been granted to the Rocker project by
explicit permission from RStudio. Users should review RStudio's
trademark use policy (<http://www.rstudio.com/about/trademark/>) and
address inquiries about further distribution or other questions to
[`permissions@rstudio.com`](mailto:permissions@rstudio.com). The Rocker
project also provides images with RStudio server and Shiny server in the
stable versioned stack.

**Build schedule**: The official `r-base` image is rebuilt by Docker
following any updates to the official `debian` images (roughly every few
weeks). The rest of the stack uses build triggers that rebuild the
images whenever `r-base` is updated or the Dockerfile sources are
updated on the corresponding GitHub repository. The only exception in
this stack is the `drd` image, which is rebuilt each week by a `cron`
trigger.

### The `debian:stable`-based stack

This stack emphasizes stability and reproducibility of the Docker build.
This stack was introduced much more recently (November 2016) in response
to considerable user input and requests. The key feature of this stack
is the ability to run older versions of R along with the
then-contemporaneous versions of R packages. A user specifies the
version desired using an image tag, *e.g.*, `rocker/r-ver:3.3.1` will
refer to an image with R version 3.3.1 installed. Omitting the tag is
equivalent to using the tag `latest`, which, as the name implies, will
always point to an image using the current R release. Thus, users who
want to create downstream Dockerfiles, which are based on the current
release at the time (but will continue to reconstruct the same
environment in the future after newer R versions are released), should
explicitly include the corresponding version tag, *e.g.*,
`rocker/r-ver:3.4.2` at the time of writing, and not the `latest` tag.
Users can also run the current development version of R using the tag
`devel`, which is built nightly from R-devel sources from `subversion`.

**MRAN archives**: To facilitate installation of only contemporaneous
versions of R packages on these images, the default CRAN mirror from
which to install R packages is fixed to a snapshot of CRAN corresponding
to the last date for which that version of R was current (*e.g.*,
`3.4.2` was released on 2017-09-28, thus `3.4.1` is pinned to the MRAN
snapshot for that date). These snapshots are provided by the MRAN
archive created by Revolution Analytics (now part of Microsoft). It
archives daily snapshots of all of CRAN from which a user can install
packages with the usual `install.packages()` function [@MRAN]. Users can
always override this default by passing any current CRAN repository
explicitly. Unlike CRAN, Bioconductor only updates its repositories
through bi-annual releases aligned to R's spring release schedule. Thus,
Bioconductor packages can be installed in the usual way using
`bioclite`, which automatically selects the Bioconductor release
corresponding to the version of R in use.

**Version tags**: The version tags are propagated throughout this stack:
*e.g.*, `rocker/tidyverse:devel` will provide the currently-released
versions of the R packages in the
[*tidyverse*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=tidyverse)
[@tidyverse-2017-125] installed on the nightly build of R-devel.
Developers building packages on this stack are encouraged to tag their
images accordingly as well. Table 3 indicates which versions of R are
currently available in the stack, going back to `3.1.0`. While older
versions may be added to the stack at a later date, we note that the
MRAN snapshots began in 2014-09-17 and thus go back only to the R `3.1`
era. Each tag must be built from a separate Dockerfile, enabling minor
differences in the build instructions to accommodate changing
dependencies. Dockerfiles for past versions (*e.g.*, prior to `3.4.2`
currently) are intended to remain static over the long term, while the
tag for the current version, `latest`, and `devel` may be tweaked to
accommodate new features or dependencies. Version tags also obey
semantics so that omitting the second or third position of the tag is
identical to asking for the most recent version: *i.e.*,
`rocker/verse:3.3` is the same as `rocker/verse:3.3.3`, and
`rocker/verse:3` is (at the time of writing), `rocker/verse:3.4.2`. This
is accomplished using post-build hooks in Docker Hub---see examples at
<https://github.com/rocker-org/rocker-versioned/> for details.

**Installation**: In this stack, the desired version of R is always
built directly from source rather than the `apt` repositories. Compilers
and dependencies are still installed from the stable `apt` repositories,
and thus lag behind the more recent versions found in the `testing`
stack. Version tags `3.3.3` and older are based on the Debian 8.0
release, code-named `jessie`, while `3.4.0` - `3.4.2`, `devel`, and
`latest` are based on Debian 9.0, `stretch`, (released 2017-06-17, while
R was at `3.4.0`), and thus have access to much newer versions of common
system dependencies and compilers. Dependencies needed to compile R that
are not required at runtime are removed once R is installed, keeping the
base images light-weight for faster download times. While most system
dependencies required by common R packages can still be installed from
the `apt` repositories, occasionally a more recent version must be
compiled from source (*e.g.*, the Gibbs Sampling program JAGS [@jags],
and the geospatial toolkit GDAL, must both be compiled from source on
`debian:jessie` images). In this stack, users should avoid installing R
packages using `apt` without careful consideration as this will install
a second (probably different) version of R from the Debian repositories,
and a dated version of the R package since any `r-cran-pkgname` package
in the Debian repositories will depend on `r-base` in `apt` as well.

**Build schedule**: All images are built automatically from their
corresponding Dockerfiles (found in the GitHub repositories
`rocker-org/rocker-versioned` and `rocker-org/geospatial`). A `cron` job
sends nightly build triggers to Docker Hub to rebuild the `latest` and
`devel` tagged images throughout the stack. To decrease load on the hub,
build triggers for the numeric version tags are sent monthly. Although
the Dockerfiles for older R versions install an almost-identical
software environment every time, the monthly rebuilding of these images
on Docker Hub ensures they continue to receive Debian security updates
from upstream, and proves the build recipe still executes successfully.
Note that rebuilding images with software from external repositories
never produces a bit-wise identical image, and thus the image identifier
hash will change at each build.

### Images overview

In this stack, each image builds on the previous image, rather than all
other images building directly on the base image, as in the `testing`
stack. Table 2 lists the names and descriptions of the five images in
this stack, along with image size and approximate download counts from
Docker Hub. Sizes reflect (compressed) cumulative size: a user who has
already downloaded the most recent version of `r-ver` and then pulls a
copy of `rstudio` image will only need to download the additional 115 MB
in the `rstudio` layers and not the full 334 MB listed. This linear
design limits flexibility (no option for `tidyverse` without `rstudio`)
but simplifies use and maintenance. While no single environment will be
optimal for everyone, both the packages selected in this stack and the
stack ordering reflect considerable community input and tuning.

The `rstudio` image includes a lightweight, easy-to-use and
docker-friendly `init` system, s6 [@s6] for running persistent services,
including the RStudio server. This system provides a convenient way for
downstream Dockerfile developers to add additional persistent services
(such as an `ssh` server) to a single container, or additional start-up
or shutdown scripts that should be run when a container starts up or
shuts down. The `rstudio` image uses such a start-up script to configure
user settings such as login password and permissions through
environmental variables at run time.

The `tidyverse` image contains all required and suggested dependencies
of the commonly-used `tidyverse` and `devtools` R packages, including
external database libraries (*e.g.*, MariaDB and PostgreSQL). Users
should consult the package Dockerfiles or `installed.packages()` list
directly for a complete list of installed packages. The `verse` library
adds commonly-used dependencies, notably a large but not comprehensive
LaTeX environment and Java development libraries. Previously, the Rocker
project provided the image `hadleyverse` which has since been divided
into `tidyverse` and `verse` based on community input.

:::

Several images in the `rocker-versioned` stack can be customized on
build when built locally (rather than pulling prebuilt images from
Docker Hub) by using the `--build-arg` option of `docker build`. In the
`r-ver` image, users can set `R_VERSION` and `BUILD_DATE` (MRAN default
snapshot). In the `rstudio` image users can set `RSTUDIO_VERSION`
(otherwise defaults to the most recent version), and the
`PANDOC_TEMPLATES_VERSION` .

This stack also makes use of Docker metadata labels defined by
<http://schema-label.org>, indicating image `license` (GPL-2.0),
`vcs-url` (GitHub repository), and `vendor` (Rocker Project). These
metadata can be altered or extended in downstream images.

# Conclusions

Over the past several years, Docker has seen immense adoption across
industry and academia. The Open Container initiative [@oci] now provides
an open standard that has further extended this container approach to
research environments through projects such as Singularity
[@singularity], allowing users to deploy containerized environments such
as Rocker on machines where they do not have root access, such as
clusters or private servers. Containerization promises to solve numerous
challenges such as portability and replicability in research computing,
which often relies on complex and heterogeneous software stacks
[@Boettiger2015]. Yet implementing such environments in containers is
not a trivial task, and not all implementations provide the same
usability, portability or reproducibility. Here we have detailed the
approach taken by the Rocker project in creating and maintaining these
environments through an open and community-driven process. This
structure of the Rocker project has evolved over three years of
operation while drawing in an ever-widening base of academic
researchers, university instructors and industry users. We believe this
overview will be instructive not only to users and developers interested
in the Rocker project, but as a model for similar efforts around other
environments or domains.
