title: A System for an Accountable Data Analysis Process in R
abstract: Efficiently producing transparent analyses may be difficult for beginners
  or tedious for the experienced. This implies a need for computing systems and environments
  that can efficiently satisfy reproducibility and accountability standards. To this
  end, we have developed a system, R package, and R Shiny application called adapr
  (Accountable Data Analysis Process in R) that is built on the principle of accountable
  units. An accountable unit is a data file (statistic, table or graphic) that can
  be associated with a provenance, meaning how it was created, when it was created
  and who created it, and this is similar to the ’verifiable computational results’
  (VCR) concept proposed by Gavish and Donoho. Both accountable units and VCRs are
  version controlled, sharable, and can be incorporated into a collaborative project.
  However, accountable units use file hashes and do not involve watermarking or public
  repositories like VCRs. Reproducing collaborative work may be highly complex, requiring
  repeating computations on multiple systems from multiple authors; however, determining
  the provenance of each unit is simpler, requiring only a search using file hashes
  and version control systems.
