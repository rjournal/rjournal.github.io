title: Dynamic Simulation and Testing for Single-Equation Cointegrating and Stationary
  Autoregressive Distributed Lag Models
abstract: While autoregressive distributed lagmodels allow for extremely flexible
  dynamics, interpreting the substantive significance of complex lag structures remains
  difficult. In this paper we discuss *dynamac* (dynamic autoregressive and cointegrating
  models), an `R` package designed to assist users in estimating, dynamically simulating,
  and plotting the results of a variety of autoregressive distributed lagmodels. It
  also contains a number of post-estimation diagnostics, including a test for cointegration
  for when researchers are estimating the error-correction variant of the autoregressive
  distributed lagmodel.

# Introduction

Many important social processes vary systematically over time. Models
designed to account for such dynamics have become more common in the
social sciences. Applied examples range from prime ministerial approval
[@clarke2000major], to the determinants of prison admission rates
[@jacobs1996toward], to preferences for different types of government
spending [@wlezien1995public], to how changing tax rates affect income
[@mertens2018marginal].

Dynamic processes take many forms. Some of these processes are
integrated, such that the current value ("realization") of a series is
an expression of all past values in the series plus some new innovation
(i.e. $y_t\sim I(1)$ if $y_t = y_{t-1} + \epsilon_t$). These series are
referred to as I(1), non-stationary, or having a "unit root."[^1] Other
processes revert back to some mean level over time. Since they are not
integrated, often these series are termed stationary, or I(0).
Stationary series are characterized by constant mean, variance, and
covariance; non-stationary series violate one or more of these
properties. An especially interesting relationship exists when two (or
more) integrated variables are in a long-run relationship with each
other, even if in the short term the series may move apart. Such series
are said to be cointegrated.[^2]

The job of properly modeling such a diverse set of dynamic processes is
challenging. Researchers want to test whether a theoretical regressor of
interest, $X$, has an effect on a dependent variable $y$, accounting for
each series' own dynamics. Moreover, these effects might occur in both
the short-run and long-run of the series. Additionally, in cases where
we have multiple I(1) variables, we must test whether the variables are
in a cointegrating relationship. Researchers still need a way to
interpret the effects of these complex models. When modeling dynamics,
then, we might be particularly drawn to a strategy that contributes to
each of these goals.

We advocate for one particular specification because of its
generalizability, flexibility and robustness to a variety of
data-generating proceeses: autoregressive distributed lag(ARDL) models.
ARDL models can account for multiple lags of independent variables,
either in levels or in first-differences, as well as multiple lags of
the dependent variable. Moreover, utilizing the ARDL-bounds testing
procedure of @pesaran2001bounds, we can test whether variables in the
ARDL model are also in a cointegrating relationship. However, the very
flexibility of this modeling strategy produces its own challenges. If
the researcher includes multiple lags (or differences, or lagged
differences) of some independent variable, it becomes increasingly
difficult to discern various effects of a change in $X$ on $y$, beyond
the individual coefficients estimated in the ARDL model. These are more
complicated than static models [@de2008taking], since they often involve
both short- and long-run effects of $X$ on $y$.[^3]

We introduce a new `R` package,
[*dynamac*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=dynamac) [@dynamacCRAN],
to help ameliorate these two challenges. The core of the package
consists of two functions: `pssbounds`, which implements the ARDL-bounds
testing procedure for cointegration [@pesaran2001bounds], and `dynardl`,
which estimates ARDL models and simulates the effect of some $X$ on $y$
by way of dynamic simulations. The simulations provided by the latter
function help provide substantive inferences of some $X$ on $y$ (1) in
both the short run *and* long run, (2) when $X$ appears in multiple
forms (such as first-differences, lagged first-differences, and/or
lagged levels), and (3) accounting for similar specifications of other
control variables $Z$. We also include functions to easily take the lag,
first-difference, and lagged-first difference of a series, as well as
post-estimation diagnostics users can employ to ensure residuals from
their resulting model are white noise. In doing so, we complement other
`R` packages designed to show substantive and statistical significance
of dynamic models [for instance, the
[*dynsim*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=dynsim) package,
@gandruddynsim; @gandrud2016tpm], as well as broader classes of models
such as those compatible with
[*Zelig*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=Zelig) [@imai2009zelig].

Below we explain the context of ARDL models generally, as well as
cointegration testing and the ARDL-bounds test in particular. We then
discuss *dynamac* functions to help estimate both the ARDL-bounds test
as well as the ARDL models (and their stochastic simulations). We
provide illustrative examples of each function, and conclude by offering
suggestions for future research.

# The general ARDL model

The autoregressive distributed lagmodel has a very general form:
$$\begin{aligned}
\label{eq:ardlgeneral}
\begin{split}
	y_t,\Delta y_t =  &\alpha_0 + \delta T + \sum_{p=1}^P \phi_p y_{t-p} + \sum_{l_1 = 0}^{L_1} \theta_{1l}x_{1,t-l_1} + \cdots + \sum_{l_k = 0}^{L_k} \theta_{kl}x_{t-l_k} + \\
	& \sum_{m=1}^M \alpha_m \Delta y_{t-m} + \sum_{q_1=0}^{Q_1} \beta_{1q_{1}} \Delta x_{1,t-q{_1}} + \cdots + \sum_{q_k=0}^{Q_k} \beta_{kq_k} \Delta x_{k,t-q{_k}} + \epsilon_t
\end{split}
\end{aligned}   (\#eq:ardlgeneral)$$

The left-hand side can be estimated either in levels ($y_t$) or in
first-differences ($\Delta y_t$). This may be a function of a constant,
a linear trend, up to $p$ lags of the dependent variable, a series of
lags for each of the $k$ regressors---appearing either contemporaneously
or with a lag---$m$ lagged first-differences of the dependent variable,
and contemporaneous and/or lagged first-differences of each of the
regressors. Lagged first-differences may enter into Equation
\@ref(eq:ardlgeneral) for theoretical reasons, or to help ensure that
the resulting residuals $\epsilon$ are white noise.[^4] Since this model
obviously results in a heavy parameterization, restrictions are often
imposed. Two of the most common restrictions are the ARDL(1,1) model
with all-stationary data:
$$\begin{aligned}
\label{eq:ardl11}
\begin{split}
	y_t =  &\alpha_0 + \phi_1 y_{t-1} + \theta_{1,0} x_{1,t} + \cdots + \theta_{k,0}x_{k,t} + \theta_{1,1} x_{1,t-1}  + \cdots+ \theta_{k,1}x_{k,t-1} + \epsilon_t %\\
	%& \sum_{m=1}^M \alpha_m \Delta y_{t-m} + \sum_{q_1=0}^{Q_1} \beta_{1q_{1}} \Delta x_{1,t-q{_1}} + \cdots + \sum_{q_k=0}^{Q_k} \beta_{kq_k} \Delta x_{k,t-q{_k}} + \epsilon_t
\end{split}
\end{aligned}   (\#eq:ardl11)$$

as well as its non-stationary and cointegrating variant, often referred
to as an error-correction model:[^5]
$$\begin{aligned}
\label{eq:ecm}
 \Delta y_t = \alpha_0 + \phi_1 y_{t-1} + \theta_{1,1}x_{1,t-1} + \cdots + \theta_{k,1}x_{k,t-1} + \beta_{1}\Delta x_{1,t} + \cdots + \beta_k \Delta x_{k,t} + \epsilon_t
 
\end{aligned}   (\#eq:ecm)$$
For clarity, lagged first-differences are not shown, although they may
be added to Equations \@ref(eq:ardl11) and \@ref(eq:ecm), either for
theoretical reasons or to purge autocorrelation from the residuals.[^6]

The strength and drawback of the ARDL model should be immediately
apparent: while researchers can specify a variety of lagged levels and
differences to account for theory as well as ensure white-noise (random)
residuals (that is, no residual autocorrelation), the same flexibility
can make inferences regarding the total effect of any individual $X$
variable difficult to discern. This is exacerbated even more when we
consider that these variables might have short-run and long-run effects.
In other words, an immediate change in an $X$ variable might have an
immediate impact in the contemporaneous period $t$, but if lagged values
of $X$ also appear in the model, this effect will persist for multiple
time periods. Moreover, if the dependent variable is entered into the
model in lagged levels through $\phi_p$, the effects of the independent
variable $X$ in some time period $t$ persist over time. There is a
cumulative---or long-run---effect across time, given a change in $X$ in
a single time period. In simple cases this can be calculated as a
non-linear combination of the lagged parameter estimate and the
parameter on the lagged dependent variable [@de2008taking]. Yet even
these calculations become tedious with multiple lags of the regressors
and the dependent variable.

We circumvent this difficulty by employing stochastic simulations rather
than direct interpretation of coefficients in order to show statistical
and substantive significance. Dynamic stochastic simulations provide an
alternative to direct hypothesis testing of coefficients, instead
focusing on simulating meaningful counterfactuals from model
coefficients many times and drawing inferences from the central
tendencies of the simulations. Such simulations are becoming
increasingly popular with increased computing power, as demonstrated in
the social sciences by recent methodological and applied work
[@tomz2003clarify; @breunig2012fiscal; @williams2012but; @philips2015ES; @philips2015dynamic; @gandruddynsim; @imai2009zelig].

Recall that the other challenge we wish to confront is that of
identifying cointegration in autoregressive distributed lagmodels in
error-correction form. In instances of small-sample data, especially of
time points $t$ of 80 or less, traditional tests like the Engle-Granger
"two-step" method [@engle1987co] or the @johansen1991estimation
[@johansen1995likelihood] approaches too often conclude cointegration
when it does not exist [@philips2016have]. An alternative test, proposed
by @pesaran2001bounds, is more conservative, meaning it does not
conclude cointegration when it does not exist, especially in small
samples. This test, which we call the ARDL-bounds test, is desirable for
the social sciences, where shorter time series (smaller samples) are
quite common. The difficulty of the ARDL-bounds test is that it requires
a specific form of the ARDL model and unique critical values. While
these are not insurmountable obstacles, the usefulness of the test would
be extended if software existed to get and test these critical values
for the user.

In *dynamac*, these challenges are resolved through `pssbounds` (named
for Pesaran, Shin and Smith, the authors of the test), which implements
the ARDL-bounds test for cointegration, and `dynardl`, which estimates
autoregressive distributed lagmodels and implements the stochastic
simulations we describe above. The commands also have the virtue of
working together: estimating an ARDL model in error-correction form with
`dynardl` by nature stores the values necessary to execute the
ARDL-bounds test with `pssbounds`. Below, we use a substantive example
to motivate our discussion of the package in greater detail.

# Modeling using *dynamac*

We illustrate the process---autoregressive distributed lagmodeling,
testing for cointegration with `pssbounds`, and interpretation of $X$
through stochastic simulations---using data originally from
@wrightpolitical on public concern about inequality in the United
States.[^7] For our example, assume that public concern about inequality
in the US, Concern (`concern`), is a function of the share of income
going to the top ten percent, Income Top 10 (`incshare10`). We also
hypothesize that the unemployment rate, Unemployment (`urate`), affects
concern over the short-run (i.e., is not cointegrating):
$$\begin{aligned}
\text{Concern}_t = f(\text{Income Top 10}_t + \Delta\text{Unemployment}_t)
\end{aligned}$$

Before estimating any model using *dynamac*, users should first check
for stationarity. A variety of unit root tests can be performed using
the [*urca*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=urca) package
[@pfaff2016package]. These suggest that all three series are integrated
of order I(1), as they appear integrated in levels but stationary in
first-differences ($\Delta$), shown in Table [1](#tab:unitroottests).

Given that all series appear to be I(1), we proceed with estimating a
model in `dynardl` in error-correction form, and then testing for
cointegration between concern about inequality and the share of income
of the top 10 percent. In general, we suggest using this
strategy---outlined in @philips2016have---along with alternative tests
for cointegration.[^8] Our error-correction model appears as:
$$\label{eq:wright1}
	\begin{split}
	\Delta\text{Concern}_t & = \alpha_0 + \phi_1\text{Concern}_{t-1} + \theta_1\text{Income Top 10}_{t-1} + \\
	& \beta_1\Delta\text{Income Top 10}_{t} + \beta_2 \Delta\text{Unemployment}_t + \epsilon_t
	\end{split}   (\#eq:wright1)$$
where we assume $\epsilon_t\sim N(0,\sigma^2)$. Now we estimate this
model with `dynardl`.

# Estimation using `dynardl`

The syntax for `dynardl`, the main function in the package, is as
follows:

-   `formula`, a formula of the type
    $y\sim x_1 + x_2 + x_3 + \ldots x_k$. Note the variables do not need
    to be lagged or differenced in the specification; these
    transformations will be handled automatically by `dynardl`.
-   `data`, an optional argument specifying a particular dataset in
    which the variables from `formula` can be found.
-   `lags`, a *list* of variables to be lagged and their corresponding
    lagged levels. For instance, if an analyst had two variables, $X_1$
    and $X_2$, that he or she wished to incorporate with a single lag at
    $t-1$, he or she would specify `lags = list("X1" = 1, "X2" = 1)`. If
    he or she wanted to incorporate multiple lags on $X_2$ from time
    periods $t-1$ and $t-2$, the code would appear as
    `lags = list("X1" = 1, "X2" = c(1, 2, ...)`, expanded for however
    many lags were desired.
-   `diffs`, a *vector* of variables to be differenced, i.e., included
    as $\Delta X_t$. Only first-differences are supported. For instance,
    if an analyst wanted to first-difference $X_1$ and $X_3$, he or she
    would include `diffs = c("X1", X3")`.
-   `lagdiffs`, a *list* of variables to be included with lagged
    first-differences. The syntax is identical to `lags`, but instead of
    incorporating lagged levels of the relevant variable $X_k$ at $t-1$,
    lagged differences $\Delta X_{k, t-1}$ are included. For instance,
    if the analyst wanted to include a first lagged difference of
    $X_{1,t}$ at $t-1$, he or she would include
    `lagdiffs = list("X1" = 1)`.
-   `levels`, a *vector* of variables to be included in levels
    contemporaneously---i.e., at time $t$. If the analyst wanted to
    include $X_{2}$ and $X_{3}$ in levels at time $t$, he or she would
    include `levels = c("X2", "X3")`.
-   `ec`, a TRUE/FALSE option for whether the model should be estimated
    in error-correcting form. If `ec = TRUE`, the dependent variable
    will be run in differences. The default is FALSE.
-   `trend`, a TRUE/FALSE option for whether a linear trend should be
    included in the regression. The default is FALSE.
-   `constant`, a TRUE/FALSE option for whether a constant should be
    included in the regression. The default is TRUE.
-   `modelout`, a TRUE/FALSE option for whether model output from the
    ARDL model should be printed in the console. The default is FALSE.
-   `simulate`, a TRUE/FALSE option for whether any shocks should be
    simulated. Since simulations are potentially computationally
    intensive, if the analyst is simply using `dynardl` to test for
    cointegration using the bounds procedure, or wishes to just view the
    model output, he or she might not wish to estimate simulations in
    the interim. The default is FALSE.[^9]

Reading the above, `dynardl` is simply an engine for regression, but one
that allows users to focus on theoretical specification rather than
technical coding. All variables in the model are entered into the
formula. In this sense, `dynardl` can be used in *any* ARDL context, not
just ones in which the user is also expecting cointegration testing or
dynamic simulations. We estimate our example model shown in Equation
\@ref(eq:wright1) using `dynardl` as follows:

``` r
	data(ineq)

	res1 <- dynardl(concern ~ incshare10 + urate, data = ineq,
		lags = list("concern" = 1, "incshare10" = 1),
		diffs = c("incshare10", "urate"),
		ec = TRUE, simulate = FALSE )

	[1] "Error correction (EC) specified;
	dependent variable to be run in differences."
```

We specify the formula by letting `dynardl` know what the dependent
variable and the regressors are. Next, in the `lags` option, we let the
program know we want a lag at $t-1$ for the dependent variable and for
Income Top 10.[^10] Since Unemployment did not appear in lag form in
Equation \@ref(eq:wright1), it does not appear in `lags`. In `diffs`, we
let `dynardl` know to include the first-difference for both Income Top
10 and Unemployment. The option `ec = TRUE` estimates the dependent
variable in error-correction form (i.e., takes the first-difference of
Concern), and the program will issue a message indicating to the user
that such a transformation has taken place.[^11] By setting
`simulate = FALSE`, we save on computing time by estimating the model
without performing stochastic simulations needed to make substantive
inferences through stochastic simulations, as shown in the next
sections. This is useful if the residuals of our first model indicate
residual autocorrelation and require respecification.

Presenting the model summary is the usual `summary(foo)`:

``` r
	summary(res1)

	Call:
	lm(formula = as.formula(paste(paste(dvnamelist), "~", paste(colnames(IVs),
	    collapse = "+"), collapse = " ")))

```

As shown from the regression results, `dynardl` has included a constant,
the lagged dependent variable, `l.1.concern`, the first difference of
the two regressors (Income Top 10 and Unemployment), as well as the lag
of Income Top 10.[^12] While changes in Income Top 10 affect changes in
Concern in the short-run, changes in Unemployment do not have a
statistically significant effect in the short-run. The lag of Income Top
10 is negative and statistically significant. Moreover, the parameter on
the lagged dependent variable is negative, between 0 and -1, and
statistically significant, giving us cursory evidence of a cointegrating
process taking place; we use a statistical test for this below.

# Post-estimation diagnostics

An essential component of ARDL modeling is ensuring that the residuals
from any ARDL estimation are white noise. One symptom of residual
autocorrelation in the presence of a lagged dependent variable (where
$\phi_1 \neq 0$) is that OLS will result in biased and inconsistent
estimates [c.f., @keele2006dynamic pp. 189-191]. Autocorrelation is
especially pernicious when using the ARDL-bounds cointegration test,
since the test relies on the assumption of, "serially uncorrelated
errors for the validity of the bounds tests" [@pesaran2001bounds
p. 311]. Moreover, a number of scholars stress that autocorrelation is
likely indicative of model misspecification more broadly---which may
cause omitted variable bias in addition to incorrect standard
errors---and thus testing for autocorrelation can help inform users as
to which covariates should be included or excluded, as well as the
correct dynamic specification [@mizon1995simple; @keele2006dynamic].

To assist users in model selection and residual testing, we offer
`dynardl.auto.correlated`. This function takes the residuals from an
ARDL model estimated by `dynardl` and conducts two tests for
autocorrelation---the Shaprio-Wilk test for normality and the
Breusch-Godfrey test for higher-order serial correlation---as well as
calculates the fit statistics for the Akaike information criterion
(AIC), Bayesian information criterion (BIC), and log-likelihood. The
arguments for this function are:

-   `x`, a `dynardl` model object.
-   `bg.type`, a character string, either `"Chisq"` or `"F"` of the type
    of Breusch-Godfrey test for higher-order serial correlation. This
    returns either the Chi-squared test statistic or the F statistic.
    The default is `"Chisq"`.
-   `digits`, an integer for the number of digits to round fit
    statistics to (by default, this is three digits).
-   `order`, an integer for the highest possible order of
    autocorrelation to test in the data. By default, this is computed by
    the length of the series.
-   `object.out`, a TRUE/FALSE option for whether to print this output
    into an object. This might be useful if the analyst is comparing
    multiple ARDL objects and testing for white-noise residuals on the
    basis of fit criteria like AIC. In this case, the analyst could
    assign the output to some object for later comparison.

To run this post-estimation diagnostics for our model above, we type:

``` r
	dynardl.auto.correlated(res1)

```

Given the results of the Breusch-Godfrey LM test for autocorrelation,
there appears to be some autocorrelation still in the residuals. To
mitigate this, we can add lagged first-differences to our model
[@philips2016have]. For instance, to add a lagged first-difference of
the dependent variable:

``` r
	res2 <- dynardl(concern ~ incshare10 + urate, data = ineq,
		lags = list("concern" = 1, "incshare10" = 1),
		diffs = c("incshare10", "urate"),
		lagdiffs = list("concern" = 1),
		ec = TRUE, simulate = FALSE)
```

For brevity the results are not shown here, but they indicate that AR(1)
autocorrelation is no longer present in the residuals after adding a
lagged first-difference of the dependent variable.

# Cointegration testing using `pssbounds`

Recall the definition of cointegration: two or more integrated series of
order I(1) are cointegrated if some linear combination of them results
in a stationary series.[^13] This means that they have some long-run
relationship; although temporary shocks may move the series apart, there
is an attracting force that brings them back into a stable equilibrium
relationship over the long-run. These movements are commonly referred to
as being "corrected" or "re-equilibrated"; cointegrated series do not
simply happen to move together, but are quite literally brought back
into long-run relationship by an attracting force. Since not all I(1)
series are cointegrating, failing to account for cointegration---in
other words, including I(1) series in an error-correction model when
they are not cointegrating---can lead to a drastic increase in Type I
error [c.f., @grant2016error].

A variety of cointegration tests have been proposed, which we do not
discuss here. Instead, we advocate for a test that has been shown to
demonstrate strong small sample properties [@philips2016have]; the
ARDL-bounds test for cointegration [@pesaran2001bounds]. The ARDL-bounds
procedure proceeds as follows. First, analysts must ensure that the
regressors are not of order I(2) or more, and that any seasonal
component of the series has been removed. Second, analysts must ensure
that the dependent variable $y$ is I(1). A wide variety of unit root
tests are designed to assist in this, including the Dickey-Fuller,
Elliott-Rothenberg-Stock, Phillips-Perron, and
Kwiatkowski-Phillips-Schmidt-Shin tests. We reference these tests in
Table [1](#tab:unitroottests).

Once the analyst ensures that the dependent variable $y$ is I(1), and
the independent variables are not of order I(2) and contain no seasonal
components, he or she estimates an ARDL model in error-correction
form.[^14] That form resembles Equation \@ref(eq:ardlecm), where the
dependent variable is run in differences:
$$\begin{aligned}
\label{eq:ardlecm}
\begin{split}
	\Delta y_t = & \alpha_0 + \phi_1 y_{t-1} + \theta_{1,1}x_{1,t-1} + \cdots + \theta_{k,1}x_{k,t-1} + \beta_{1}\Delta x_{1,t} + \cdots + \beta_k \Delta x_{k,t} +\\
	& \sum_{m=1}^M \alpha_m \Delta y_{t-m} + \sum_{q_1=1}^{Q_1} \beta_{1q_{1}} \Delta x_{1,t-q{_1}} + \cdots + \sum_{q_k=1}^{Q_k} \beta_{kq_k} \Delta x_{k,t-q{_k}} + \epsilon_t
\end{split}
\end{aligned}   (\#eq:ardlecm)$$

Two points are key. First, any independent variables that are
potentially I(1) must be entered in lagged levels at $t-1$. Second, the
resulting residuals of the ARDL model must be white noise in order to
perform the cointegration test (approximately normally distributed, with
no residual autocorrelation). If they are not, the analyst should
incorporate additional lags of the first difference of the variables
until they are [@philips2016have]. A variety of tests exist to help
determine whether the residuals are white noise, as well as aiding in
model specification, including information criteria (like SBIC and AIC),
Breusch-Godfrey tests, Durbin's Alternative test, and Cook-Weisberg.
Users can find most of these in `dynardl.auto.correlated`, discussed in
the previous section.

The special case of the ARDL model in Equation \@ref(eq:ardlecm) is that
the $X$ variables appearing in levels ($\theta_1 \ldots \theta_k$) are
the only ones that can possibly be in a cointegrating relationship with
the dependent variable $y$. The ARDL-bounds test for cointegration works
by using a Wald or F-test on the following restriction from Equation
\@ref(eq:ardlecm):
$$\begin{aligned}
\label{restrictftest}
H_0 : \phi_1 = \theta_{1,1} = \cdots = \theta_{k,1}= 0
\end{aligned}   (\#eq:restrictftest)$$

In other words, that the coefficients on variables appearing in first
lags are jointly equal to zero. The null hypothesis is that of no
cointegration. Rejecting the null hypothesis indicates there is a
cointegrating relationship between the series. In addition to the
F-test, a one-sided t-test may be used to test the null hypothesis that
the coefficient on the lagged dependent variable (in levels) is equal to
zero, or:
$$\begin{aligned}
\label{restrictttest}
H_0 : \phi_1 = 0
\end{aligned}   (\#eq:restrictttest)$$

The alternative to this test is that $\phi_1 < 0$, or that $y$ is
cointegrating with the regressors. This is known as the bounds t-test.

The procedure and tests themselves are relatively straightforward to
implement, but are complicated by two factors. The first is that
critical values for these tests are non-standard, meaning that they are
not readily testable in canned procedures. The correct (asymptotic)
critical values are provided by @pesaran2001bounds, and the small sample
critical values for the F-statistic are given by @narayan2005.[^15]
Moreover, the appropriate critical values depend on the "case" of the
regression: a combination of whether the regression includes a
(restricted) trend term (or not) and a (restricted) constant (or not).
As @philips2016have describes, whether the resulting F-statistic is
higher than the I(1) critical value, below the I(0) critical value, or
between the two, gives differential evidence on the integrated nature of
the $X$ variables and the potential cointegrating relationship between
them.

Just looking at the above discussion: even if the test is powerful, it
can be difficult to implement and interpret correctly. Accordingly, we
offer two functions to help implement the test and get dynamic
inferences. The first function, `dynardl`, estimates the ARDL
relationship described above (to obtain the resulting F-statistic and
t-statistic). The second function, `pssbounds`, takes the results of the
ARDL model and implements the ARDL-bounds test for cointegration,
providing the user with the correct critical values and an
easy-to-understand description of hypothesis testing.

To summarize, if we find that the dependent variable and regressors are
all I(1), they can only appear in lagged levels in the error-correction
model if there is evidence of cointegration. *dynamac* contains the
@pesaran2001bounds ARDL-bounds cointegration test to assist users in
testing for this. To implement the bounds testing procedure, we
introduce the function `pssbounds`. This function has the following
syntax:

-   `data`, an optional argument expecting a `dynardl` model, which
    calculates the following arguments for the user. If none is given,
    the user must supply each of the following:
-   `obs`, an integer for the number of observations in the model time
    series.
-   `fstat`, the $F$ statistic on the restriction that each of the first
    lags in the model (including the lagged dependent variable) are
    jointly equal to zero.
-   `tstat`, the $t$ statistic on the lagged dependent variable in the
    error-correction model.
-   `case`, a numeric 1-2-3-4-5 or numeral I-II-III-IV-V of the case of
    the regression.
    -   1: No intercept and no trend
    -   2: Restricted intercept and no trend
    -   3: Unrestricted intercept and no trend (the most common case)
    -   4: Unrestricted intercept and restricted trend
    -   5: Unrestricted intercept and unrestricted trend
-   `k`, the number of regressors appearing in first lags.
-   `digits`, an integer for the number of digits to round fit
    statistics to (by default, this is three digits).
-   `object.out`, a TRUE/FALSE option for whether to print this output
    into an object. The default is FALSE.

This command can be implemented in two ways. First, users can run the
appropriate model (following the instructions of @philips2016have) and
pass the relevant arguments---`obs`, `fstat`, `tstat`, `case`, and
`k`---to `pssbounds`. Alternatively---and as we advocate---users can
estimate the model using `foo <- dynardl(...)` and then,
post-estimation, run `pssbounds(foo)`.[^16]

Moving back to our example, to test for cointegration, we use the
`pssbounds` command:[^17]

``` r
	res2 <- dynardl(concern ~ incshare10 + urate, data = ineq,
		lags = list("concern" = 1, "incshare10" = 1),
		diffs = c("incshare10", "urate"),
		lagdiffs = list("concern" = 1),
		ec = TRUE, simulate = FALSE)

	pssbounds(res2)

```

The program displays the number of observations from the regression, the
number of regressors appearing in lagged levels (i.e., the cointegrating
equation), and the case (unrestricted intercept and no trend); all of
these are necessary to obtain the special critical values used by
@pesaran2001bounds.[^18] This situates the F-statistic and t-statistic
with the correct critical values for the appropriate test. Users are
then free to compare the test statistics to the critical values and make
the appropriate deduction regarding cointegration in the sample model.

In our example, since the value of the F-statistic exceeds the critical
value at the upper I(1) bound of the test at the 1% level, we may
conclude that Income Top 10 and Concern about inequality are in a
cointegrating relationship. As an auxiliary test, `pssbounds` displays a
one-sided test on the t-statistic on the lagged dependent variable.[^19]
Since the t-statistic of -3.684 falls below the 5% critical value I(1)
threshold, this lends further support for cointegration. Taken together,
these findings indicate that there is a cointegrating relationship
between concern about inequality and the income share of the top 10
percent, and that Equation \@ref(eq:ardlecm) is appropriately
specified.[^20]

# Gaining substantive and statistical significance of results using `dynardl`

Once users have decided on the appropriate theoretical
model---accounting for the appropriate lags of the independent
variables, first-differenced variables, and so on---and drawn
conclusions regarding cointegration using `pssbounds` (if applicable),
their resulting models might be somewhat complicated. Our solution to
inferences in the face of this complexity is the use of stochastic
simulations.[^21]

If a user runs `dynardl` with the argument `simulate = TRUE`, then the
following options become available:

-   `shockvar`, the independent variable to be shocked in the
    simulation. This is the independent variable for which we want to
    estimate an effect. Analysis should enter this in quotes, like
    `shockvar = "X1"`. This is the only option required without a
    default: we must know which variable we want inferences about.
-   `shockval`, the amount by which the independent variable should be
    shocked. The default is a standard deviation of the shock variable.
-   `time`, the time period within the `range` of the simulation when to
    shock the independent variable of interest (the `shockvar`). The
    default is 10.
-   `qoi`, whether we should summarize the response of the dependent
    variable with the mean or the median. Although the default is
    `mean`, if there is underlying skew in the distribution, it might be
    better summarized by `median` [@raineytransform].
-   `forceset`, a *list* of variables and their values that should be
    set to particular values during the simulations. By default,
    variables in levels are held at their means, and variables in
    differences are held at 0. If `forceset` is not specified, the
    simulation will be estimated using these default values. However, if
    the analyst wanted to investigate the change in $y$ when some
    variables are at different values, he or she should do this with
    `forceset`. These values can be any user-defined value, including
    means, medians, percentiles, or other values of interest. For
    instance, if $X_1$ was meant to be held at 3 (rather than the mean
    of $X_1$), the analyst would specify `forceset = list("X1" = 3)`.
-   `range`, an integer for how long the simulation is to run (the
    default is 20 periods)
-   `burnin`, the number of time periods before the range begins.
    `burnin` allows time for the variables to equilibriate. The default
    is 20. This means that 20 time periods are simulated, then the range
    of the simulation begins. Users are not shown the `burnin` time
    periods.
-   `sims`, the number of simulations to run. The quantities of interest
    are created from these simulations. The default number is 1000.
-   `sig`, an integer for any user-desired significance level in the
    form of $1 - p$. So if the user wants a $p$ value of 0.10, `sig`
    would be 90. The default level is 95.
-   `expectedval`, a TRUE/FALSE option for whether the expected values
    (which average errors within simulations) or predicted values (which
    do not) are desired. Unless the analyst has a strong reason to use
    expected values, we recommend using predicted values by including
    `expectedval = FALSE`, the default.

`dynardl` takes this set of arguments and generates the appropriate
autoregressive distributed laggiven the levels, lagged levels,
first-differences, and lagged first-differences of the variables
provided. Once this model is estimated using OLS, `dynardl` simulates
the quantities of interest. Specifically, the coefficients $\hat\beta$
are simulated as draws (with number of `sims`) from a multivariate
normal distribution with mean of $\hat\beta$ and variance from the
variance-covariance of the estimated model (using the
[*MASS*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=MASS) package from
@ripleyMASS). We introduce uncertainty into these simulations by
simulating $\hat\sigma^2$ scaled by random draws from the chi-squared
distribution. We then use this estimate of $\hat\sigma^2$ to add back in
fundamental random error to the predicted value of each simulation.
These predictions come from set levels of the independent variables: the
$X$ variables in levels are held at their means and other variables in
differences are held at 0. Users can override this default by specifying
a different value for any variable using `forceset`. Note that the
equation is given time to equilibriate (through the use of `burnin`
periods) before the independent variable is shocked.

Perhaps the most important argument is `shockvar`. This is the variable
for which the user wants some sort of inference regarding the effect of
an independent variable on the dependent variable: the response in the
dependent variable is created by shocking the `shockvar`. At time
`time`, the `shockvar` is "shocked" by the amount of `shockval`. This
shock is distributed appropriately, as defined by the model specified.
For instance, if the `shockvar` is entered into the model in lagged
levels at time $t-1$, that $X$ variable would be shocked at `time`
$+ 1$. Just like in an interactive model, one of the best ways to gain
inferences regarding the effect of $X$ on $y$ is by varying a single $X$
at a single point in time. Accordingly, only a single `shockvar` can be
specified.

The only thing left to resolve is what to do with our `sims`. We are not
particularly interested in any individual simulation in any individual
time period. Rather, we can get a sense of the central effect of the
`shockvar` on $y$ by doing some meaningful analysis across the
simulations within any time period. Accordingly, in `foo$simulation`,
`dynardl` stores the desired summary quantity of interest (either
`qoi = "mean"` or `qoi = "median"`) of $y$ in each time period. It also
stores the lower and upper percentiles for the 75%, 90% and 95%
intervals. Users can add additional intervals with `sig`. Additionally,
users can specify whether they want predicted values (the average across
the simulations within a time period) or expected values (where each
individual simulation essentially averages out fundamental error). This
is through the option `expectedval = FALSE` or `TRUE`, respectively; we
highly recommend the former.

Moving back to our substantive example, now that we have our model and
found the relationship to be cointegrating, we move onto interpreting
the results through dynamic simulations. Again, although analytic
calculations of short- and long-run effects are possible [c.f.,
@de2008taking], with a multitude of lags and lagged first differences,
the ability to interpret the effect on $y$, given a change in a
regressor, can become even more difficult. One of the easiest ways of
getting a sense of the effect of the `shockvar` on $y$ is through
plotting the simulation results
[@tomz2003clarify; @breunig2012fiscal; @williams2012but; @philips2015ES; @philips2015dynamic; @gandruddynsim; @blackwell2018apsr; @imai2009zelig].
To this end, we offer two more functions: `area.simulation.plot` and
`spike.simulation.plot`. The only difference is whether an area plot or
a spike plot is desired (both are illustrated below). The arguments for
both functions are:

-   `x`, a dynardl model object with a simulation to plot.
-   `response`, whether the the simulated response of the dependent
    variable should be plotted in absolute `levels` of the response, or
    in changes from the mean value of the dependent variable
    (`response = "mean.changes"`). The default is `response = "levels"`.
-   `bw`, whether the plot should be produced in black and white (for
    publications) or color. The default is `bw = FALSE` (a color plot).

To plot these simulations, all the researcher needs to do is imagine the
counterfactual he or she wishes to investigate. For instance, what is
the effect of a 7-percentage-point increase in Income Top 10 on Concern?
To examine statistical and substantive significance of this
counterfactual, we estimate the following model below and plot it. Note
that users may want to first set a seed in order to ensure that the
plots are reproducible, since the simulations are stochastic. The
resulting plot is shown in Figure [1](#fig:areaplot).

``` r
	set.seed(2059120)
	res3 <- dynardl(concern ~ incshare10 + urate, data = ineq,
		lags = list("concern" = 1, "incshare10" = 1),
		diffs = c("incshare10", "urate"),
		lagdiffs = list("concern" = 1),
		ec = TRUE, simulate = TRUE,
		shockvar = c("incshare10"), shockval = .07)

	area.simulation.plot(res3)
```

![Figure 1: Area plot produced using
`area.simulation.plot()`](areaplot.png){#fig:areaplot width="100%"
alt="graphic without alt text"}

The black dotted line shows the predicted value, while the colored
areas, from darkest to lightest, show the 75, 90, and 95 percentiles of
the predictions from the simulations, something akin to a credible
interval or confidence interval. The shock to Income Top 10 occurs by
default at $t=10$, though users can change this using the `time` option.
If instead we desire a spikeplot, we could type:

``` r
spike.simulation.plot(res3)
```

The resulting plot is shown in Figure [2](#fig:spikeplot).

![Figure 2: Spike plot produced using
`spike.simulation.plot()`](spikeplot.png){#fig:spikeplot width="100%"
alt="graphic without alt text"}

Figures [1](#fig:areaplot) and [2](#fig:spikeplot) both illustrate that
the immediate effect of a 7-percentage-point increase in Income Top 10
is to increase Concern by about 4 percentage points. Over time, this
effect decays, eventually moving Concern to a new value of 0.56 from its
pre-shock mean of 0.58. For clarity: these effects are produced by
estimating the model formula given by the user, taking the estimated
coefficients from the model, drawing a number of simulated coefficients
from a multivariate normal distribution with mean and variance given by
the estimated coefficients and variance-covariance from the model, and
using them to predict values of the dependent variable (and
incorporating fundamental error by drawing stochastic terms from
$\hat\sigma^2$). It then tracks the response in these predicted values
to simulated shifts in the independent variables. We might also note
that the dependent variable *could* still be responding: users could
increase the `range` of the simulation time periods to ensure that the
dependent variable has enough time to respond.

Users may have noticed fluctuations in the confidence intervals shown in
Figures [1](#fig:areaplot) and [2](#fig:spikeplot). This is due to the
stochastic sampling technique used to create these simulations. When
using `dynardl`, users have the option of increasing the number of
simulations performed using the `sims` option. This should have the
effect of smoothing out period-to-period fluctuations in the confidence
intervals, at the cost of increased computing time.

# Additional tools for dynamic analysis with *dynamac*

`dynardl` has a number of additional features users may find useful.
First, not only is it suitable for error-correction models; `dynardl`
can model a variety of stationary ARDL processes. To see this, we show a
simple example using data from @durr2000ideological, who examine how
ideological movements in the United States affect aggregate public
support for the Supreme Court. Our model is:
$$\begin{split}
\text{Supreme\ Court\ Support}_t = & \alpha + \phi_1 \text{Supreme\ Court\ Support}_{t-1} + \beta_1 \text{Ideological\ Divergence}_t + \\
&  \beta_2 \text{Congressional Approval}_t + \epsilon_t
	\end{split}$$
where support for the US Supreme Court (1973-1993) (`dcalc`) is a
function of a constant, the lag of Supreme Court Support, the
ideological divergence between the Supreme Court and the public
(Ideological Divergence, `iddiv`), and the level of Congressional
Approval (`congapp`).[^22] To estimate this model using `dynardl`, we
type:

``` r
	data(supreme.sup)

	res4 <- dynardl(dcalc ~ iddiv + congapp, data = supreme.sup,
		lags = list("dcalc" = 1),
		levels = c("iddiv", "congapp"),
		ec = FALSE, simulate = FALSE)

	[1] "Dependent variable to be run in levels."
```

Anytime we specify `levels`, any variables appearing in the list will be
included contemporaneously (i.e., appear at time $t$ without any lags or
differences) in the model. As with the error-correction specification,
we can obtain regression results by typing:

``` r
	summary(res4)

	Call:
	lm(formula = as.formula(paste(paste(dvnamelist), "~", paste(colnames(IVs),
		collapse = "+"), collapse = " ")))

	Residuals:

	F-statistic: 10.91 on 3 and 37 DF,  p-value: 2.833e-05
```

As the results show, the lag of Supreme Court Support is only weakly
related to Supreme Court Support. Moreover, as Ideological Divergence
grows, Supreme Court Support decreases. In contrast, as Congressional
Approval increases, Supreme Court Support also increases. We can also
bring a substantive interpretation to these effects by again using
stochastic simulations. We can investigate the counterfactual of a
15-percentage-point decrease in Congressional Approval on Supreme Court
Support. Moreover, we demonstrate the difference between the number of
simulations used to generate predictions in Figure [3](#fig:simcomp).

``` r
	# 1000 sims
	res4 <- dynardl(dcalc ~ iddiv + congapp, data = supreme.sup,
		lags = list("dcalc" = 1),
		levels = c("iddiv", "congapp"),
		ec = FALSE, simulate = TRUE,
		shockval = -15, shockvar = c("congapp"))

	# 15000 sims
	res5 <- dynardl(dcalc ~ iddiv + congapp, data = supreme.sup,
		lags = list("dcalc" = 1),
		levels = c("iddiv", "congapp"),
		ec = FALSE, simulate = TRUE,
		shockval = -15, shockvar = c("congapp"),
		sims = 15000)

	par(mfrow = c(2, 1))
	area.simulation.plot(res4)
	area.simulation.plot(res5)
```

![Figure 3: Effect of a 15-percentage-point decrease in Congressional
Approval; 1000 simulations (default) (top) and 15000
(bottom)](simulationnumber.png){#fig:simcomp width="100%"
alt="graphic without alt text"}

The effect of the 15-percentage-point decrease in Congressional Approval
is about a 10-point decrease in Supreme Court Support. To uncover this
effect, the upper plot uses 1000 simulations, while the bottom uses
15000 and results in a much smoother measure of uncertainty in
predictions across the simulated timeframe, with only a slight increase
in estimation time.[^23] Of course, it is important to note that
simulations do not *lower* uncertainty (simulating more values does not
decrease the underlying variance). More simulations just improve and
smooth our estimates within each time period.

While the default range for simulations is 20 time periods, with a shock
occurring at time $t=10$---as shown in Figure [3](#fig:simcomp) for
instance---users can change these using the `time` and `range` options.
In addition, `dynardl` offers the ability to set variables at particular
values other than their means throughout the simulation through the
option `forceset`.[^24] This would be ideal when the mean value is not
particularly intuitive or of substantive interest, such as when dealing
with a dichotomous variable. Instead, users can specify particular
values using the option `forceset`. As an example of this, we
re-estimate the model from above, but extend the total simulation range
to $t=50$, the shock time to $t=20$, and set both Congressional Approval
and Ideological Divergence to their 75th percentiles instead of their
means:

``` r
	res6 <- dynardl(dcalc ~ iddiv + congapp, data = supreme.sup,
		lags = list("dcalc" = 1),
		levels = c("iddiv", "congapp"),
		ec = FALSE, simulate = TRUE,
		shockval = -15, shockvar = c("congapp"),
		sims = 15000, time = 20, range = 50,
		forceset = list("iddiv" = 0.22, "congapp" = 72))

	spike.simulation.plot(res6)
```

The results of a 15-percentage-point drop in Congressional Approval on
Supreme Court Support are shown in Figure [4](#fig:longrange). It is
clear that there is a relatively quick negative effect on Supreme Court
Support in response to a drop in Congressional Approval, and Supreme
Court Support remains at around 88 for the rest of the time periods.

`forceset`](longrange.png){#fig:longrange width="100%"

*dynamac* also offers a few ancillary functions to help assist in
dynamic modeling using autoregressive distributed lagmodels and
`dynardl` in particular. These include three basic time-series operators
to lag, difference, and lag-difference variables. Users are free to
utilize these functions outside of estimating the models.

For lagging variables, we use `lshift(x, l)`, where `x` is the variable
to be lagged and `l` is the number of periods to be lagged. If a user
wanted a second lag (that is $X_{t - 2}$, he or she would use
`lshift(X, 2)`:

``` r
	head(ineq$incshare10)
	[1] 0.3198 0.3205 0.3198 0.3182 0.3151 0.3175

	head(lshift(ineq$incshare10, 2)) # second lag
	[1]     NA     NA 0.3198 0.3205 0.3198 0.3182
```

For differencing variables, we use `dshift(x)`, where `x` is the
variable to be first-differenced:

``` r
	head(dshift(ineq$incshare10))
	[1]      NA  0.0007 -0.0007 -0.0016 -0.0031  0.0024
```

For lag-differencing variables, we use `ldshift(x, l)`, where `x` is the
variable to be lag-differenced and `l` is the number of periods for the
difference to be lagged. If a user wanted for the difference of $X$ from
two time periods ago ($\Delta X_{t-2}$) to be calculated, he or she
would use `ldshift(X, 2)`:

``` r
	head(ldshift(ineq$incshare10, 2))
	[1]      NA      NA      NA  0.0007 -0.0007 -0.0016
```

# Additional example: the GDP-energy nexus

As a final example, we model the relationship between a country's energy
consumption and its economic output. There is a substantial body of
literature that focuses on both the short-and long-run effects between
energy and GDP---as well as the directionality of the
relationship---making it a prime candidate for time series analysis
[@ozturk2010literature; @tugcu2012renewable]. In fact, a number of
articles utilize the bounds testing approach discussed above [e.g.,
@odhiambo2009energy; @fuinhas2012energy]. In the analysis below, we
focus on two key variables: the natural log of gross domestic product
(in constant 2010 US dollars) and the log of energy consumption (in
million tons of oil equivalent). These data are for the French economy,
measured annually from 1965 to 2017.[^25] For this example, we assume
that energy consumption, `lnenergy`, drives GDP, `lnGDP_cons2010USD`,
not the other way around.

As Figure [5](#fig:francefig) suggests, both series appear
non-stationary, with probably a trend as well. Unit-root tests (not
shown) confirm that both series contain a unit root. Therefore, we
proceed to estimate an ARDL model in error-correction form with a
deterministic trend, test for cointegration, and interpret the results.

```

As is clear from the regression results, there appears to be a fairly
slow rate of re-equilibration when the two series are out of their
long-run equilibrium relationship, as shown by the coefficient on the
lagged dependent variable. Moreover, both the first-difference and lag
of the log of energy consumption, as well as the trend variable, are
statistically significant. Before proceeding to test for cointegration,
we ensure the residuals are white-noise using `dynardl.auto.correlated`:

``` r
	dynardl.auto.correlated(res7)

	 ------------------------------------------------------
	 Breusch-Godfrey LM Test
	 Test statistic: 2.563
	 p-value: 0.109
	 H_0: no autocorrelation up to AR 1

	 ------------------------------------------------------
	 Shapiro-Wilk Test for Normality
	 Test statistic: 0.971
	 p-value: 0.241
	 H_0: residuals are distributed normal

	 ------------------------------------------------------
	 Log-likelihood: 162.789
	 AIC: -313.578
	 BIC: -301.87
	 Note: AIC and BIC calculated with k = 5 on T = 52 observations.

	 ------------------------------------------------------
```

The Breusch-Godfrey test suggests there is no residual autocorrelation
of order AR(1), and the residuals are approximately normally
distributed. In addition, using the information criteria reported in
`dynardl.auto.correlated`, we find that the model with a trend term
estimated above is more consistent with the data than one without (these
results are not reported here). Given that the model appears to be
well-specified, we proceed to test for cointegration. Note that the
program automatically selects critical values from "Case 5", an
unrestricted intercept and trend:

```

Since the F-statistic (i.e., the test that all variables appearing in
lagged levels are equal to zero) is larger than the I(1) critical value
in the table at the 5% level, we conclude that cointegration between
energy consumption and economic output exists. In addition, the
one-sided t-test of the coefficient on the lagged dependent variable
also supports the conclusion of cointegration. Given our model results,
and finding evidence of cointegration, we turn to a substantive
interpretation of our findings: what would be the effect of a one
standard deviation decrease in energy consumption on GDP?

``` r
	res7 <- dynardl(lnGDP_cons2010USD ~ lnenergy, data = france.data,
                lags = list("lnGDP_cons2010USD" = 1, "lnenergy" = 1),
                diffs = c("lnenergy"), trend = TRUE,
                ec = TRUE, simulate = TRUE, shockvar = "lnenergy", shock = -0.2289)

```

As shown by the spikeplot in Figure [6](#fig:francespike), the pre-shock
(i.e., any prediction before $t=10$) values are consistently increasing
over time; this is due to the trend term. At $t=10$, the one standard
deviation decrease in energy consumption occurs. This effect does not
result in a statistically significant decrease in the contemporaneous
period, but continues to lower GDP until two periods after the shock
occurs. Moreover, it is not until 10 years after this hypothetical shock
that GDP returns to its pre-shock level.

# Conclusion

In this paper we have introduced *dynamac*, a suite of functions
designed to assist applied time series analysts. This centers around
`dynardl`, a multipurpose function to estimate autoregressive
distributed lag models. This flexible program models both stationary
ARDL relationships as well as cointegrating ones, and it allows users to
easily change model specifications (e.g., lags, differences, and
lag-differences). We also include two post-estimation diagnostic
commands to check for white-noise residuals and cointegration. Last,
through several applied examples we have shown the advantages of dynamic
simulation for interpreting the substantive significance of the results
of single-equation time series models, something users can easily do
using *dynamac*.

There are a number of interesting potential future research areas. Most
useful would be extending ARDL modeling to the panel context. While
other packages are designed to handle multiple panels [c.f.,
@gandrud2016tpm], the ability to incorporate models that account for
unit heterogeneity, such as random or fixed intercepts, would prove
useful to users. In addition, adding the ability to estimate alternative
models in the dynamic panel data context, such as those that account for
causal feedback and time-varying covariates [@blackwell2018apsr], or
generalized method of moments (GMM) estimators, would also assist
practitioners.
:::

[^1]: A unit-root is one common form of non-stationarity; a series could
    be non-stationary due to a linear trend, for instance.

[^2]: Stationary variables cannot be in cointegrating relationships, as
    their long-run response is to return to their mean value, not a
    linear combination of some other series.

[^3]: See @beck2011modeling or @blackwell2018apsr for a discussion of
    this in the cross-sectional time series context.

[^4]: i.e., $\epsilon\sim N(0,\sigma^2)$. We discuss the importance of
    white-noise residuals below.

[^5]: Of course, all-stationary series may be estimated in an
    error-correction model as well [@de2008taking].

[^6]: i.e., users could add:
    $\sum_{m=1}^M \alpha_m \Delta y_{t-m} + \sum_{q_1=0}^{Q_1} \beta_{1q_{1}} \Delta x_{1,t-q{_1}} + \cdots + \sum_{q_k=0}^{Q_k} \beta_{kq_k} \Delta x_{k,t-q{_k}}$.

[^7]: Available at: <http://dx.doi.org/10.7910/DVN/UYUU9G>. For
    simplicity, we use a smaller version of Wright's dataset with
    missing values at the beginning of the series removed.

[^8]: These include the @johansen1995likelihood cointegration test
    (available in *urca*) or the proposed test by @engle1987co, among
    others.

[^9]: For this first example, we will treat this option as FALSE.

[^10]: If we wanted further lags, we could specify it here, for instance
    `lags = list("concern" = c(1,2), "incshare10" = 2, "urate" = 2)`
    would add lags at $t-1$ and $t-2$ for concern, and at $t-2$ for
    `incshare10` and `urate`.

[^11]: Setting this option to `FALSE` would estimate the dependent
    variable in levels. If `ec = TRUE`, the saved object will also
    contain `$pssbounds`, described below.

[^12]: Lagged variables are denoted by `l.X.variable`, where `X` is the
    lag. First-differences are denoted by `d.variable`. Lagged
    first-differences are denoted by `l.d.X.variable`, where `X` is the
    lag.

[^13]: For instance, given $y_t = \kappa_0 + \kappa_1x_t + z_t$,
    cointegration would exist if $z_t\sim$I(0). Higher orders of
    cointegration may also be cointegrating---something known as
    multicointegration---but these are not supported by the ARDL-bounds
    test.

[^14]: Note this does not require the analyst to make the sharp
    distinction between an I(0) or an I(1) regressor, a special benefit
    of the ARDL-bounds procedure. This is especially useful when "near
    integrated" series can appear to be integrated in small samples even
    though, if we were to observe more innovations, the series would
    ultimately return to some mean value (that is, it would be
    stationary).

[^15]: No small-sample critical values are given for the t-test, so it
    should not be used to conclusively decide whether a cointegrating
    relationship exists; rather, only for confirmatory evidence.

[^16]: As described earlier, this only applies to models where
    `ec = TRUE`, as only error-correcting models can potentially be
    cointegrating.

[^17]: To re-emphasize, this test is inappropriate if the residuals are
    not white-noise [@pesaran2001bounds p. 311]. Therefore, it is
    crucial to users to first test for stationarity, run `dynardl`, and
    adjust their model as needed before testing for cointegration.

[^18]: @pesaran2001bounds provide asymptotic critical values. We use
    small-sample critical values, calculated by @narayan2005, when
    available.

[^19]: We call this an auxiliary test since only asymptotic critical
    values are available, while small sample critical values are
    available for most F-tests. When not available, `pssbounds` issues a
    warning note.

[^20]: Had we not found evidence of cointegration, (either the
    F-statistic fell between or below the I(1) and I(0) critical
    values), we could adjust our model accordingly, as outlined by
    @philips2016have.

[^21]: If users are aiming for analysis to be able to be repeated, they
    should set a seed before engaging in stochastic simulations.

[^22]: As stressed in previous sections, stationarity testing is
    recommended on all dependent and independent variables before
    determining whether a stationary or error-correcting ARDL model
    should be estimated. This is a stylized example only meant to
    demonstrate additional capabilities of *dynamac*.

[^23]: For comparison, in this model, 1000 simulations took 3.98
    seconds, while 15,000 took 4.12 seconds.

[^24]: Recall that, by default, variables in levels are set to their
    means throughout the simulation (unless shocked), while variables in
    differences are set to zero.

[^25]: GDP data are from the World Bank World Development Indicators.
    Data on energy consumption are from the BP Statistical Review of
    World Energy (June 2018), available at:
    <https://www.bp.com/en/global/corporate/energy-economics/statistical-review-of-world-energy.html>.
