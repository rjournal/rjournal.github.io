title: Dynamic Simulation and Testing for Single-Equation Cointegrating and Stationary
  Autoregressive Distributed Lag Models
abstract: While autoregressive distributed lag models allow for extremely flexible
  dynamics, interpret ing the substantive significance of complex lag structures remains
  difficult. In this paper we discuss dynamac (dynamic autoregressive and cointegrating
  models), an R package designed to assist users in estimating, dynamically simulating,
  and plotting the results of a variety of autoregressive distributed lag models.
  It also contains a number of post-estimation diagnostics, including a test for cointegration
  for when researchers are estimating the error-correction variant of the autoregressive
  distributed lag model.
