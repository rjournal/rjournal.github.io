title: Measurement Units in R
abstract: We briefly review SI units, and discuss R packages that deal with measurement
  units, their compatibility and conversion. Built upon udunits2 and the UNIDATA udunits
  library, we introduce the package units that provides a class for maintaining unit
  metadata. When used in expression, it automatically converts units, and simplifies
  units of results when possible; in case of incompatible units, errors are raised.
  The class flexibly allows expansion beyond predefined units. Using units may eliminate
  a whole class of potential scientific programming mistakes. We discuss the potential
  and limitations of computing with explicit units.
