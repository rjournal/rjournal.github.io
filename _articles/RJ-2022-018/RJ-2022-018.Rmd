title: 'starvars: An R Package for Analysing Nonlinearities in Multivariate Time Series'
abstract: ' Although linear autoregressive models are useful to practitioners in different
  fields, often a nonlinear specification would be more appropriate in time series
  analysis. In general, there are many alternative approaches to nonlinearity modelling,
  one consists in assuming multiple regimes. Among the possible specifications that
  account for regime changes in the multivariate framework, smooth transition models
  are the most general, since they nest both linear and threshold autoregressive models.
  This paper introduces the [starvars](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=starvars)
  package which estimates and predicts the Vector Logistic Smooth Transition model
  in a very general setting which also includes predetermined variables. In comparison
  to the existing R packages, starvars offers the estimation of the Vector Smooth
  Transition model both by maximum likelihood and nonlinear least squares. The package
  allows also to test for nonlinearity in a multivariate setting and detect the presence
  of common breaks. Furthermore, the package computes multi-step-ahead forecasts.
  Finally, an illustration with financial time series is provided to show its usage. '
