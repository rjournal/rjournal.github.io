title: 'RobustGaSP: Robust Gaussian Stochastic Process Emulation in R'
abstract: Gaussian stochastic process (GaSP) emulation is a powerful tool for approximating
  compu tationally intensive computer models. However, estimation of parameters in
  the GaSP emulator is a challenging task. No closed-form estimator is available and
  many numerical problems arise with standard estimates, e.g., the maximum likelihood
  estimator. In this package, we implement a marginal posterior mode estimator, for
  special priors and parameterizations. This estimation method that meets the robust
  parameter estimation criteria was discussed in Gu et al. (2018); mathematical reasons
  are provided therein to explain why robust parameter estimation can greatly improve
  predictive performance of the emulator. In addition, inert inputs (inputs that almost
  have no effect on the variability of a function) can be identified from the marginal
  posterior mode estimation at no extra computational cost. The package also implements
  the parallel partial Gaussian stochastic process (PP GaSP) emulator (Gu and Berger
  (2016)) for the scenario where the computer model has multiple outputs on, for example,
  spatial-temporal coordinates. The package can be operated in a default mode, but
  also allows numerous user specifications, such as the capability of specifying trend
  functions and noise terms. Examples are studied herein to highlight the performance
  of the package in terms of out-of-sample prediction.
