title: 'abctools: An R Package for Tuning Approximate Bayesian Computation Analyses'
abstract: Approximate Bayesian computation (ABC) is a popular family of algorithms
  which perform approximate parameter inference when numerical evaluation of the likelihood
  function is not possible but data can be simulated from the model. They return a
  sample of parameter values which produce simulations close to the observed dataset.
  A standard approach is to reduce the simulated and observed datasets to vectors
  of summary statistics and accept when the difference between these is below a specified
  threshold. ABC can also be adapted to perform model choice. In this article, we
  present a new software package for R, abctools which provides methods for tuning
  ABC algorithms. This includes recent dimension reduction algorithms to tune the
  choice of summary statistics, and coverage methods to tune the choice of threshold.
  We provide several illustrations of these routines on applications taken from the
  ABC literature.
