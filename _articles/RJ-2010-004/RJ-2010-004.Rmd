# Introduction

Our CShapes project [@weidmann10geography] provides electronic maps of
the international system for the period 1946--2008 in a standard
Geographic Information System (GIS) format. Most existing GIS maps
consider only contemporary country configurations and do not include
information on changes in countries and borders over time. Beyond the
value of more accurate historical maps in their own right for
visualization, such maps can also help improve statistical analyses.
Comparative research in the social sciences often considers
country-level characteristics such as total population, economic
performance, or the degree to which a country's political institutions
can be characterized as democratic. Many theories relate such outcomes
to other characteristics of individual countries, and typically ignore
how possible interdependence between countries may also determine
outcomes. However, over recent years there has been more attention to
the spatial relationship between observations. For example, the level of
democracy in a country can be strongly influenced by how democratic its
neighbors are [@gled:2002]. Similarly, conflict diffusion across
national boundaries implies that the risk of civil war in a country will
be partly determined by conflict in its immediate proximity
[@gleditsch07transnational]. Tobler's [-@tobler70computer 236] *First
Law of Geography* states that "everything is related to everything else,
but near things are more related than distant things". To the extent
that this applies to the international system, we need to--at a
theoretical level--specify the transnational mechanisms that cause these
interdependencies, and--at an analytical level--our empirical techniques
must properly incorporate spatial interdependence among observations.

The CShapes dataset and the R package
[*cshapes*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=cshapes) presented in
this article help address the second task. Assessing spatial dependence
in the international system requires measures of the connections and
distances between our units of analysis, i.e., states. There exist
various data collections that provide different indicators of spatial
interdependence: a contiguity dataset [@gochman:1991], the
minimum-distance database by @gled:ward:2001:jpr, a dataset of shared
boundary lengths [@furlong03boundary], and distances between capitals
[@gleditsch08distance]. However, although all of these collections
entail indicators from a map of the international system at a given
point in time, these databases provide the final indicators in fixed
form rather than directly code the information from the underlying maps.

Our CShapes project takes a different approach and provides electronic
maps of the international system for the period 1946--2008 from which
such geographical indicators can be coded directly. The R package
[*cshapes*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=cshapes) allows computing
important distance measures directly from these maps. This approach has
several advantages over the existing spatial indicators mentioned above.
First, it ensures that the computed indicators are comparable, since
they all refer to the same geopolitical entities. Second, maintaining
and updating the dataset becomes much more convenient: If a change
occurs in the international system -- such as for example the
independence of Montenegro in 2006 -- we only need to update the
electronic maps and re-run the computations in order to get up-to-date
distance measures as of 2006. Third, the availability of electronic maps
opens up new possibilities for visualization of country-level variables.

In the remainder of this article we provide a brief overview of the
underlying spatial dataset of country boundaries, describing our coding
approach and the data format. We then turn to the
[*cshapes*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=cshapes) package for R,
and describe three main applications the package can be used for: (i)
visualizing country data as maps, (ii) computing new spatial indicators
for countries, and (iii) creating weights matrices for spatial
regression models.

# The CShapes Dataset

## Coding Criteria

Creating the CShapes dataset requires us to define coding rules with
respect to three questions: (i) what constitutes an independent state,
(ii) what is its spatial extent, and (iii) what constitutes a
territorial change to a state. The following paragraphs summarize our
approach. For a more detailed discussion, we refer the reader to
@weidmann10geography.

#### What is a state?

There are various criteria for defining states. Research in Political
Science often relies on the list of independent states provided by the
*Correlates of War, 2008* (COW) project. This list relies on several
criteria, including recognition by the UK and France, membership in the
League of Nations and the United Nations, as well as other ad-hoc
criteria. An alternative *Gleditsch and Ward* (GW)
[-@gleditsch99interstate] list of independent states addresses some
limitations of the COW list, and has also gained a wide acceptance in
the research community. As a result, we have made CShapes compatible
with both the COW and GW state lists.

#### What is the spatial extent of a state?

In many cases, the territory of a state comprises several (and possibly
disjoint) regions with different status. For colonial states, an obvious
distinction can be made between the "homeland" of a state and its
dependent territories or colonies. Territory can also be disputed
between states, such as for example the Golan Heights in the border
region between Syria and Israel, or territory claimed may not be
directly controlled or accepted by other states, as in the case of
claims in Antarctica. As there are many such cases it is often
impossible to allocate particular territories to states. To avoid this
difficulty, we only code the core territories of state, without
dependent territories or disputed regions.

#### What constitutes a territorial change?

Given the spatial extent of a state, we need to define the territorial
changes that should be reflected in the dataset. Our data encompass
three types of changes are given in the dataset. First, new states can
become independent, as in the case of the the secession of Eritrea from
Ethiopia in 1993. Second, states can merge, as in the case of the
dissolution of the (Eastern) German Democratic Republic in 1990 and its
ascension to the (Western) German Federal Republic. Third, we may have
territorial changes to a state that do not involve the emergence or
disappearance of states.

CShapes includes all changes of the first two types. To keep the effort
manageable, we only code changes of the third type that (i) affect the
core territory of a state, and (ii) affect an area of at least 10,000
square kilometers. Our coding here is based on an existing dataset of
territorial changes by @tir98territorial.

## Implementation

Geographic data are typically stored in one of two formats: raster and
vector data. Raster data represent continuous spatial quantities, such
as territorial elevation, while vector data are used to capture discrete
spatial entities ("features"), such as cities, rivers or lakes. There
are three basic types of vector data: points, lines and polygons. The
latter are the most appropriate for representing state boundaries. Apart
from the spatial features themselves, vector data formats store
non-spatial information related to them in an *attribute table*. For
example, in a dataset of point features representing cities, we could
store the name and population of each city in the attribute table.

![Figure 1: []{#fig:shpexample label="fig:shpexample"} CShapes vector
data representation as polygons with lifetimes [from
@weidmann10geography].](shpexample.png){#fig:shpexample width="100%" alt="graphic without alt text"}

In CShapes, we use polygons to represent state boundaries at a given
time, and supplement the temporal information for these polygons in the
attribute table. This is done by assigning a lifetime (i.e., a start day
and an end day) to each polygon. By filtering the "active" polygons for
a given date, it is possible to get a snapshot of the international
system for this date. Figure [1](#fig:shpexample) illustrates the
CShapes data representation with each polygon's lifetime in the
attribute table. The attribute table also contains the country
identifier according to the COW and GW lists, as well as the location of
the state capital in latitude/longitude coordinates. This information is
required for the calculation of capital distances between states (see
below). The CShapes vector dataset is provided in the shapefile format
[@esri98shapefile], which can be used directly in standard GIS
applications. However, in order to provide a more accessible interface
to the data and to enable additional computations, we have developed the
[*cshapes*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=cshapes) R package
introduced in the next section.

# The cshapes R Package and Applications

The [*cshapes*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=cshapes) package for
R has two main purposes: first, to make the CShapes data available for
use within R, and second, to perform additional operations on the data,
in particular weights matrix computation for spatial regression
modeling. In the following, we introduce the basic functionality of the
package and later demonstrate its use through three illustrative
applications.

## Accessing the Data

In R, basic support for spatial data is provided by the
[*sp*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=sp) package, which includes a
set of classes both for vector and raster data. Other packages add
functionality to work with these classes, as for example the
[*maptools*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=maptools) package for
reading/writing shapefiles, drawing maps, or the
[*spdep*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=spdep) package for spatial
regression. For an introduction to R's spatial features, we refer to the
overview in @bivand06implementing, and to @bivand08applied for a
detailed introduction.
[*cshapes*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=cshapes) draws on these
packages in making the historical country boundaries available for use
within R. The `cshp()` function is a convenience method to load the
spatial dataset and returns a `SpatialPolygonsDataFrame`, which can be
used to access and modify both the polygons and the attached attribute
table. As an example to illustrate this, we first demonstrate how to
extract country boundaries for a given point in time, and later use
these data to visualize data, in this case the regime type of countries.

``` r
# load country border as of 2002
> cmap.2002 <- cshp(date=as.Date("2002-1-1"))
```

We can now join the extracted polygons for this date with supplementary
information about countries. The Polity IV database [@marshall08polity]
provides a summary indicator about regime type. The indicator ranges
from -10 to 10, with low values corresponding to autocratic regimes, and
high values corresponding to democratic systems. For the example below,
the Polity dataset is downloaded and filtered to retain only the 2002
values. Furthermore, the `polity.2002` data frame contains only two
columns, the COW country identifier (ccode) and the regime type
indicator (polity2). In order to match this information, we first need
to match country identifiers from cshapes with those in the Polity
dataset. As the Polity data is not available for all countries in 2002,
we do not get a regime type value for each country in `cmap.2002`.

``` r
# download dataset, filter scores for 2002
> polity.file <- paste(tempdir(),
+ "p4v2008.sav",  sep="/")
> download.file("http://www.systemicpeace.org/
+ inscr/p4v2008.sav", polity.file)
> polity <- read.spss(polity.file, to.data.frame=T)
> polity.2002 <- polity[polity$year==2002,]
> polity.2002 <- subset(polity.2002,
+ !is.na(polity2), select=c(ccode, polity2))

# match country identifiers from both datasets
> o <- match(cmap.2002$COWCODE, polity.2002$ccode)

# order polity dataset accordingly
polity.2002 <- polity.2002[o,]

# set row names, required for spCbind function
row.names(polity.2002) <- cmap.2002$FEATUREID

# append using spCbind
cmap.2002.m <- spCbind(cmap.2002, polity.2002)
```

## Drawing Maps

The above created dataset with appended regime type scores for 2002 can
now be used for visualizing regime type across space. As described in
@bivand08applied [ch. 3], the
[*classInt*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=classInt) package is
useful for creating maps with color shadings. The literature commonly
distinguishes between three regime types: autocracies (Polity scores -10
through -7), anocracies (scores -6 through 6) and democracies (scores 7
through 10), a typology we employ for our example. Using the
`classIntervals()` and `findColors()` functions, we divide regime type
scores into three different classes and assign colors of different
intensity, where more autocratic countries are displayed using darker
colors. The following example shows the code necessary to generate the
map in Figure [2](#fig:politymap).

``` r
# generate a color palette
> pal <- grey.colors(3, 0.25, 0.95)

# find the class intervals and colors
> breaks <- classIntervals(cmap.2002.m$polity2,
+ n=3, style="fixed", fixedBreaks=c(-10, -6, 7, 10))
> colors <- findColours(breaks, pal)

# create plot and add legend
> plot(cmap.2002.m, bty="n", col=colors)
> legend(x="bottomleft",
+ legend=c("Autocracy", "Anocracy", "Democracy"),
+ fill = attr(colors, "palette"),
+ bty = "n", title="Regime type")
```

scores according to the Polity dataset for
2002.](politymap.png){#fig:politymap width="100%" alt="graphic without alt text"}

## Spatial Variables for Countries

As an example of spatial characteristics that can be calculated using
[*cshapes*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=cshapes) we consider the
distance between a country's capital and its geographical center. The
extent to which a country contains extensive peripheries or hinterlands
is often held to be an important influence on state consolidation and
the risk of conflict [@herbst00states; @buhaug08disaggregating]. A
simple measure of unfavorable geography can be derived from comparing
the position of a state capital relative to the geographic center of a
country. Figure [3](#fig:capcentexamples) shows the borders of two
African countries, the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Nigeria, as
well as their capitals and their polygon centroids. In the Democratic
Republic of the Congo (left), the capital Kinshasa is located in the far
West of the country, which creates large hinterlands in the East.
Nigeria (right) has a more balanced configuration, with the capital
Abuja located close to the centroid.

![Figure 3: []{#fig:capcentexamples label="fig:capcentexamples"}
Illustration of the measure of deviation between the geographic centroid
of a polygon and the capital. Left: Democratic Republic of Congo, right:
Nigeria [from
@weidmann10geography].](capcentexamples.png){#fig:capcentexamples
width="100%" alt="graphic without alt text"}

For a systematic statistical test, we compute the capital--centroid
deviation from the capital to the polygon centroid for each
country/year. We do not show the complete regression analysis here, but
focus on the computation of this indicator. We first obtain the
centroids for all polygons using the `coordinates()` function in the
[*sp*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=sp) package. We then apply a
newly created function called `distance()` to each polygon. This
function is essentially a wrapper around the `spDistsN1` function from
the [*sp*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=sp) package and computes
the distance between each polygons's centroid and its capital. The
capital longitude and latitude is obtained directly from the respective
polygon's attributes (the CAPLONG and CAPLAT fields). Note that since
the CShapes dataset is unprojected, we need to set the `longlat=TRUE`
parameter in the `spDistsN1` function in order to obtain great circle
distances.

``` r
> cmap <- cshp()
> centroids <- coordinates(cmap)
> distance <- function(from.x, from.y, to.x, to.y) {
+ from <- matrix(c(from.x, from.y), ncol=2, nrow=1)
+ spDistsN1(from, c(to.x, to.y), longlat = TRUE)
+ }
> cmap$capcentdist <- mapply(distance, centroids[,1],
+ centroids[,2], cmap$CAPLONG, cmap$CAPLAT)

```

## Computing Country Distances

Spatial statistical applications typically require that we first specify
spatial structure. One way to represent this is by means of a matrix
indicating adjacency or distance between any two observations $i,j$. A
matrix of this kind can then be transformed into a weights matrix that
assigns a higher weight to spatially close observations. As discussed
above, there are many advantages to computing these distances directly
from a spatial dataset such as CShapes, which is why we provide a
dynamic way of distance computation in our package, rather than offering
pre-computed distances. This also makes it possible to compute these
matrices for arbitrary points in time.

With countries as the unit of analysis, distance matrices are typically
based on one of three types of distance [@ward:gled:2008]. First, we can
consider the distance between the capital cities of two countries.
Second, rather than capitals, we can use the geographical center point
of a country for distance computation. This center point or centroid is
the country's geometric center of gravity. Third, we can measure the
minimum distance between two countries, i.e. the distance between two
points, one from each country, that are closest to each other.
@gled:ward:2001:jpr discuss the relative advantages of different
measures in greater detail. Computing distances between predetermined
points as in the first two alternatives is straightforward; we only need
to take into account that the CShapes dataset is unprojected, which is
why we compute great circle distances. Finding the minimum distance,
however, is more complicated as we need to consider the shape and
position for two countries to find the closest points.

#### The `distmatrix()` function.

[*cshapes*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=cshapes) computes
distance matrices of all three types with its `distmatrix()` function.
Capital and centroid distances are easy to compute, as there is only one
point per polygon used for the computation. Obtaining the minimum
distance is more difficult. Given two countries, we need to compute the
distance of each point on one of the polygons to all lines in the other
polygon. This procedure must be repeated for each pair of countries.
Because the computational costs of this procedure, the
[*cshapes*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=cshapes) package
implements three ways for speeding up this computation. First, we
implement the distance computation in Java, using the
[*rJava*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=rJava) package for
interfacing and the Java Topology Suite[^1] (JTS) for handling spatial
data in Java. Second, we resort to computing distances between pairs of
points in the two polygons, rather than between points and lines. Third,
we reduce the number of points in a polygon, which results in fewer
comparisons to be made. The polygon simplification is readily
implemented in JTS according to the algorithm proposed by
@douglas73algorithms. The accuracy of the simplification can be
controlled by a threshold parameter that indicates the maximum allowed
deviation of the simplified shape from the original one. Figure
[4](#fig:simplifyexample) shows an example of the shapes generated by
the polygon simplification, using our default threshold (0.1).

![Figure 4: []{#fig:simplifyexample label="fig:simplifyexample"} Result
of the polygon simplification procedure using the Douglas-Peucker
algorithm. The shaded areas show the borders between Portugal and Spain
according to the original, detailed dataset. The solid line shows these
boundaries after the simplification process, where twisted segments have
been replaced by straight ones, while preserving the basic shape of a
country.](simplifyexample.png){#fig:simplifyexample width="100%" alt="graphic without alt text"}

`distmatrix()` is the
[*cshapes*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=cshapes) function to
generate distance matrices. It returns a symmetric matrix $D_{i,j}$,
where the entries $d_{i,j}$ correspond to the distance between countries
$i$ and $j$ in kilometers, and all $d_{i,j}=0$. The rows and columns are
labeled by the respective country identifier, according to the COW or GW
coding system. Since the layout of the international system changes over
time, the first parameter of the function specifies the date at which
the matrix should be computed. The country coding system to be used is
set by the `useGW` parameter, which defaults to the Gleditsch and Ward
system. The distance type is specified by the `type` parameter that has
three possible values: `capdist`, `centdist` and `mindist`. Furthermore,
the `tolerance` parameter sets the threshold for the Douglas-Peucker
polygon simplification described above. This parameter only affects
minimum distance computation. The default value of this parameter is
0.1, and a value of 0 disables polygon simplification. Below, we compare
the execution time obtained with default polygon simplification to no
simplification.[^2]

``` r
> system.time(dmat.simple <- distmatrix(
+ as.Date("2002-1-1"), type="mindist"))
   user  system elapsed
223.286   0.842 224.523

> system.time(dmat.full <- distmatrix(
+ as.Date("2002-1-1"), type="mindist",
+ tolerance=0))
    user   system  elapsed
12452.40    48.67 12686.44

> cor(as.vector(dmat.simple),
+ as.vector(dmat.full))
[1] 0.9999999
```

Because of the quadratic scaling of the minimum distance computation,
the reduction in computational costs achieved by the simplification
procedure is extremely high. Whereas default polygon simplification
allows us to compute the complete matrix in less than four minutes, the
same procedure on the full dataset takes about four hours. Still, the
inaccuracies introduces by the simplification are very small; the
computed distance matrices correlate at 0.999.

#### Computing spatial weights.

Once a distance matrix has been computed, we can transform it to
different weights matrices, depending on the respective application.
Weights matrices based on spatial adjacency assign a weight of 1 to all
entries with $d_{i,j} \le t$ for a distance threshold $t$. Empirical
research suggests that it is helpful for many applications to have a
relatively inclusive threshold $t$ (for example, 900 km) to determine
relevant neighboring states, in order to prevent excluding states that
are not directly contiguous yet in practice often have high levels of
interaction [@gled:2002]. Alternatively, we can transform a distance
matrix into a continuous weights matrix by inverting the $d_{i,j}$. The
following code illustrates how to generate weights from
[*cshapes*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=cshapes) distance
matrices.

``` r
> dmat <- distmatrix(as.Date("2002-1-1"),
+ type="mindist")

# adjacency matrix, 900 km threshold
> adjmat <- ifelse(dmat > 900, 0, 1)
> diag(adjmat) <- 0

# inverse distance
> invdmat <- 1/dmat
> diag(invdmat) <- 0

# save matrix for later use
> write.table(adjmat, "adjmat2002.txt",
+ row.names=T, col.names=T)

# load matrix
> adjmat <- read.table("adjmat2002.txt",
+ header=T, check.names=F)
```

#### Integration with [*spdep*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=spdep).

[*spdep*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=spdep) is one of R's most
advanced packages for spatial statistical analysis. It relies on two
basic representations for spatial structure: neighbor lists for discrete
neighborhood relationships, and weights lists for storing spatial
weights between observations. Using functions from the
[*spdep*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=spdep) package, it is
possible to convert the matrices created by
[*cshapes*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=cshapes). The following
code demonstrates how to do this.

``` r
# neighbor list from adjacency matrix:
# create a weights list first...
> adjmat.lw <- mat2listw(adjmat,
+ row.names=row.names(dmat))

# ... and retrieve neighbor list
> adjmat.nb <- adjmat.lw$neighbours

# weights list from weights matrix
> invdmat.lw <- mat2listw(invdmat,
+ row.names=row.names(invdmat))
```

The neighbor lists obtained from
[*cshapes*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=cshapes) can then be used
to fit spatial regression models using
[*spdep*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=spdep).

# Conclusions

Accurate historical maps are essential for comparative cross-national
research, and for incorporating spatial dependence into applied
empirical work. Our CShapes dataset provides such information in a
standard GIS format for the period 1946--2008. In this paper, we have
introduced our [*cshapes*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=cshapes)
package that provides a series of tools for useful operations on these
data within R. Our package supplements the existing valuable packages
for spatial analysis in R, and we hope that the package may facilitate
greater attention to spatial dependence in cross-national research.
