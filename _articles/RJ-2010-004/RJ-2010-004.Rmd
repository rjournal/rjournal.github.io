title: Mapping and Measuring Country Shapes
abstract: The article introduces the cshapes R package, which includes our CShapes
  dataset of contemporary and historical country boundaries, as well as computational
  tools for computing geographical measures from these maps. We provide an overview
  of the need for considering spatial dependence in comparative research, how this
  requires appropriate historical maps, and detail how the cshapes associated R package
  cshapes can contribute to these ends. We illustrate the use of the package for drawing
  maps, computing spatial variables for countries, and generating weights matrices
  for spatial statistics.
