title: 'ROCnReg: An R Package for Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve Inference
  With and Without Covariates'
abstract: |
  This paper introduces the package ROCnReg that allows estimating the pooled ROC
   curve, the covariate-specific ROC curve, and the covariate-adjusted ROC curve by different methods,
   both from (semi) parametric and nonparametric perspectives and within Bayesian and frequentist
   paradigms. From the estimated ROC curve (pooled, covariate-specific, or covariate-adjusted), several
   summary measures of discriminatory accuracy, such as the (partial) area under the ROC curve and the
   Youden index, can be obtained. The package also provides functions to obtain ROC-based optimal
   threshold values using several criteria, namely, the Youden index criterion and the criterion that
   sets a target value for the false positive fraction. For the Bayesian methods, we provide tools for
   assessing model fit via posterior predictive checks, while the model choice can be carried out via
   several information criteria. Numerical and graphical outputs are provided for all methods. This is
   the only package implementing Bayesian procedures for ROC curves.
