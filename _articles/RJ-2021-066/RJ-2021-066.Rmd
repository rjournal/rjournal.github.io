title: 'ROCnReg: An R Package for Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve Inference
  With and Without Covariates'
abstract: This paper introduces the package ROCnReg that allows estimating the pooled
  ROC curve, the covariate-specific ROC curve, and the covariate-adjusted ROC curve
  by different methods, both from (semi) parametric and nonparametric perspectives
  and within Bayesian and frequentist paradigms. From the estimated ROC curve (pooled,
  covariate-specific, or covariate-adjusted), several summary measures of discriminatory
  accuracy, such as the (partial) area under the ROC curve and the Youden index, can
  be obtained. The package also provides functions to obtain ROC-based optimal threshold
  values using several criteria, namely, the Youden index criterion and the criterion
  that sets a target value for the false positive fraction. For the Bayesian methods,
  we provide tools for assessing model fit via posterior predictive checks, while
  the model choice can be carried out via several information criteria. Numerical
  and graphical outputs are provided for all methods. This is the only package implementing
  Bayesian procedures for ROC curves.
