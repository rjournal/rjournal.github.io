title: Six Years of Shiny in Research - Collaborative Development of Web Tools in
  R
abstract: The use of Shiny in research publications is investigated over the six and
  a half years since the appearance of this popular web application framework for
  R, which has been utilised in many varied research areas. While it is demonstrated
  that the complexity of Shiny applications is limited by the background architecture,
  and real security concerns exist for novice app developers, the collaborative benefits
  are worth attention from the wider research community. Shiny simplifies the use
  of complex methodologies for people of different specialities, at the level of proficiency
  appropriate for the end user. This enables a diverse community of users to interact
  efficiently, and utilise cutting edge methodologies. The literature reviewed demonstrates
  that complex methodologies can be put into practice without insisting on investment
  in professional training, for a comprehensive understanding from all participants.
  It appears that Shiny opens up concurrent benefits in communication between those
  who analyse data and other disciplines, that would enrich much of the peer-reviewed
  research.
