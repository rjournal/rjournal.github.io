title: 'ExactCIdiff: An R Package for Computing Exact Confidence Intervals for the
  Difference of Two Proportions'
abstract: Comparing two proportions through the difference is a basic problem in statistics
  and has applications in many fields. More than twenty confidence intervals (Newcombe,
  1998a,b) have been proposed. Most of them are approximate intervals with an asymptotic
  infimum coverage probability much less than the nominal level. In addition, large
  sample may be costly in practice. So exact optimal confidence intervals become critical
  for drawing valid statistical inference with accuracy and precision. Recently, Wang
  (2010, 2012) derived the exact smallest (optimal) one-sided 1 − α confidence intervals
  for the difference of two paired or independent proportions. His intervals, however,
  are computer-intensive by nature. In this article, we provide an R package ExactCIdiff
  to implement the intervals when the sample size is not large. This would be the
  first available package in R to calculate the exact confidence intervals for the
  difference of proportions. Exact two-sided 1 − α interval can be easily obtained
  by taking the intersection of the lower and upper one-sided 1 − α/2 intervals. Readers
  may jump to Examples 1 and 2 to obtain these intervals.
