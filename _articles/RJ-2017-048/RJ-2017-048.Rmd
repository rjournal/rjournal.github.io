title: 'liureg: A Comprehensive R Package for the Liu Estimation of Linear Regression
  Model with Collinear Regressors'
abstract: The Liu regression estimator is now a commonly used alternative to the conventional
  ordinary least squares estimator that avoids the adverse effects in the situations
  when there exists a considerable degree of multicollinearity among the regressors.
  There are only a few software packages available for estimation of the Liu regression
  coefficients, though with limited methods to estimate the Liu biasing parameter
  without addressing testing procedures. Our liureg package can be used to estimate
  the Liu regression coefficients utilizing a range of different existing biasing
  parameters, to test these coefficients with more than 15 Liu related statistics,
  and to present different graphical displays of these statistics.
