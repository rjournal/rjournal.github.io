title: 'rTableICC: An R Package for Random Generation of 22K and RC Contingency Tables'
abstract: In this paper, we describe the R package rTableICC that provides an interface
  for random generation of 2×2×K and R×C contingency tables constructed over either
  intraclass-correlated or uncorrelated individuals. Intraclass correlations arise
  in studies where sampling units include more than one individual and these individuals
  are correlated. The package implements random generation of contingency tables over
  individuals with or without intraclass correlations under various sampling plans.
  The package include two functions for the generation of K 2×2 tables over product-multinomial
  sampling schemes and that of 2×2×K tables under Poisson or multinomial sampling
  plans. It also contains two functions that generate R×C tables under product-multinomial,
  multinomial or Poisson sampling plans with or without intraclass correlations. The
  package also includes a function for random number generation from a given probability
  distribution. In addition to the contingency table format, the package also provides
  raw data required for further estimation purposes.
