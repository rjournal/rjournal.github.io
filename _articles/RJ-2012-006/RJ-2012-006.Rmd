title: 'xgrid and R: Parallel Distributed Processing Using Heterogeneous Groups of
  Apple Computers'
abstract: The Apple Xgrid system provides access to groups (or grids) of computers
  that can be used to facilitate parallel processing. We describe the *xgrid* package
  which facilitates access to this system to undertake independent simulations or
  other long-running jobs that can be divided into replicate runs within R. Detailed
  examples are provided to demonstrate the interface, along with results from a simulation
  study of the performance gains using a variety of grids. Use of the grid for "embarassingly
  parallel" independent jobs has the potential for major speedups in time to completion.
  Appendices provide guidance on setting up the workflow, utilizing add-on packages,
  and constructing grids using existing machines.

# Introduction

Many scientific computations can be sped up by dividing them into
smaller tasks and distributing the computations to multiple systems for
simultaneous processing. Particularly in the case of embarrassingly
parallel [@wilk:alle:1999] statistical simulations, where the outcome of
any given simulation is independent of others, parallel computing on
existing grids of computers can dramatically increase computation speed.
Rather than waiting for the previous simulation to complete before
moving on to the next, a grid controller can distribute tasks to agents
(also known as nodes) as quickly as they can process them in parallel.
As the number of nodes in the grid increases, the total computation time
for a given job will generally decrease. Figure [1](#fig:input1)
provides a conceptual model of this framework.

![Figure 1: Conceptual model of the Apple Xgrid framework (derived from
graphic by F. Loxy)](images/xgridframework.png){#fig:input1 width="100%"
alt="graphic without alt text"}

Several solutions exist to facilitate parallel computation within R.
@GridR developed [*GridR*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=GridR), a
condor-based environment for settings where one can connect directly to
agents in a grid. The [*Rmpi*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=Rmpi)
package [@Rmpi] is an R wrapper for the popular Message Passing
Interface (MPI) protocol and provides extremely low-level control over
grid functionality. The *rpvm* package [@rpvm] provides a connection to
a Parallel Virtual Machine [@PVM]. The
[*snow*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=snow) package [@snow]
provides a simpler implementation of *Rmpi* and *rpvm*, using a
low-level socket functionality. The
[*multicore*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=multicore) package
[@multicore] provides several functions to divide work between a single
machine's multiple cores. Starting with release 2.14.0, *snow* and
*multicore* are available as slightly revised copies within the
*parallel* package in base R.

The Apple Xgrid [@AppleXgridSystem] technology is a parallel computing
environment. Many Apple Xgrids already exist in academic settings, and
are straightforward to set up. As loosely organized clusters, Apple
Xgrids provide *graceful degradation*, where agents can easily be added
to or removed from the grid without disrupting its operation. Xgrid
supports heterogeneous agents (also a plus in many settings, where a
single grid might include a lab, classroom, individual computers, as
well as more powerful dedicated servers) and provides automated
housekeeping and cleanup. The Xgrid Admin program provides a graphical
overview of the controller, agents and jobs that are being managed
(instructions on downloading and installing this tool can be found in
Appendix C).

We created the [*xgrid*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=xgrid)
package [@xgrid] to provide a simple interface to this distributed
computing system. The package facilitates use of an Apple Xgrid for
distributed processing of a simulation with many independent
repetitions, by simplifying job submission (or grid stuffing) and
collation of results. It provides a relatively thin but useful layer
between R and Apple's `xgrid` shell command, where the user constructs
input scripts to be run remotely. A similar set of routines, optimized
for parallel estimation of JAGS (just another Gibbs sampler) models is
available within the
[*runjags*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=runjags) package
[@runjags]. However, with the exception of *runjags*, none of the
previously mentioned packages support parallel computation over an Apple
Xgrid.

We begin by describing the *xgrid* package interface to the Apple Xgrid,
detailing two examples which utilize this setup, summarizing simulation
studies that characterize the performance of a variety of tasks on
different grid configurations, then close with a summary. We also
include a glossary of terms and provide three appendices detailing how
to access a grid using R (Appendix A), how to utilize add-on packages
within R (Appendix B), and how to construct a grid using existing
machines (Appendix C).

# Controlling an Xgrid using R

To facilitate use of an Apple Xgrid using R, we created the *xgrid*
package, which contains support routines to split up, submit, monitor,
then retrieve results from a series of simulation studies.

The `xgrid()` function connects to the grid by repeated calls to the
`xgrid` command at the Mac OS X shell level on the client. Table
[1](#tab:xgridcommand) displays some of the actions supported by the
`xgrid` command and their analogous routines in the *xgrid* package.
While users will ordinarily not need to use these routines, they are
helpful in understanding the workflow. These routines are designed to
call a specified R script with suitable environment (packages, input
files) on a remote machine. The remote job is given arguments as part of
a call to `R CMD BATCH`, which allow it to create a unique location to
save results, which are communicated back to the client by way of R
object files created with the R `saveRDS()` function. Much of the work
involves specifying a naming structure for the jobs, to allow the
results to be automatically collated.

The `xgrid()` function is called to start a series of simulations. This
function takes as arguments the R script to run on the grid (by default
set to `job.R`), the directory containing input files (by default set to
`input`), the directory to save output created within R on the agent (by
default set to `output`), and a name for the results file (by default
set to `RESULTS.rds`). In addition, the total number of iterations in
the simulation (`numsim`) and number of tasks per job (`ntask`) can be
specified. The `xgrid()` function divides the total number of iterations
into `numsim/ntask` individual jobs, where each job is responsible for
calculating the specified number of tasks on a single agent (see
FigureÂ [1](#fig:input1)). For example, if 2,000 iterations are desired,
these could be divided into 200 jobs each running 10 of the tasks. The
number of active jobs on the grid can be controlled using the `throttle`
option (by default, all jobs are submitted then queued until an agent is
available). The `throttle` option helps facilitate sharing a large grid
between multiple users (since by default the Apple Xgrid system provides
no load balancing amongst users).

::: {#tab:xgridcommand}
  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Action       R Function         Description
  ------------ ------------------ -------------------------------------------
  submit       `xgridsubmit()`    submit a job to the grid controller

  attributes   `xgridattr()`      check on the status of a job

  results      `xgridresults()`   retrieve the results from a completed job

  delete       `xgriddelete()`    delete the job
  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

  : Table 1: Job actions supported by the `xgrid` command and their
  analogous functions in the *xgrid* package
:::

The `xgrid()` function checks for errors in specification, then begins
to repeatedly call the `xgridsubmit()` function for each job that needs
to be created. The `xgrid()` function also calls `xgridsubmit()` to
create a properly formatted `xgrid -job submit` command using Mac OS X
through the R `system()` function. This has the effect of executing a
command of the form `R CMD BATCH file.R` on the grid, with appropriate
arguments (the number of repetitions to run, parameters to pass along
and the name of the unique filename to save results). The results of the
`system()` call are saved to be able to determine the identification
number for that particular job. This number can be used to check the
status of the job as well as retrieve its results and delete it from the
system once it has completed.

Once all of the jobs have been submitted, `xgrid()` then periodically
polls the list of active jobs until they are completed. This function
makes a call to `xgridattr()` and determines the value of the
`jobStatus` attribute. The function waits (sleeps) between each poll, to
lessen load on the grid.

When a job has completed, its results are retrieved using
`xgridresults()` then deleted from the system using `xgriddelete()`.
This capability relies on the properties of the Apple Xgrid, which can
be set up to have all files created by the agent when running a given
job copied to the `output` directory on the client computer. When all
jobs have completed, the individual result files are combined into a
single data frame in the current directory. The `output` directory has a
complete listing of the individual results as well as the R output from
the remote agents. This directory can be useful for debugging in case of
problems and the contents are typically accessed only in those cases.

To help demonstrate how to access an existing Xgrid, we provide two
detailed examples: one involving a relatively straightforward
computation assessing the robustness of the one-sample t-test and the
second requiring use of add-on packages to undertake simulations of a
latent class model. These examples are provided as vignettes within the
package. In addition, the example files are available for download from
<http://www.math.smith.edu/xgrid>.

# Examples

## Example 1: Assessing the robustness of the one-sample t-test

The t-test is remarkedly robust to violations of its underlying
assumptions [@sawi:blai:1992]. However, as @Hesterberg argues, not only
is it possible for the total non-coverage to exceed $\alpha$, the
asymmetry of the test statistic causes one tail to account for more than
its share of the overall $\alpha$ level. Hesterberg found that sample
sizes in the thousands were needed to get symmetric tails.

In this example, we demonstrate how to utilize an Apple Xgrid cluster to
investigate the robustness of the one-sample t-test, by looking at how
the $\alpha$ level is split between the two tails. When the number of
simulation iterations is small ($<100,000$), this study runs very
quickly as a loop in R. Here, we provide the computation of a study
consisting of $10^6$ iterations. A more efficient alternative would be
to use `pvec()` or `mclapply()` of the *multicore* package to distribute
this study over the cores of a single machine. However for the purposes
of illustration, we conduct this simple statistical investigation over
an Xgrid to demonstrate package usage, and to compare the results and
computation time to the same study run with a `for` loop on a local
machine.

Our first step is to set up an appropriate directory structure for our
simulation (see Figure [5](#fig:input2); Appendix A provides an overview
of requirements). The first item is the folder `input`, which contains
two files that will be run on the remote agents. The first of these
files, `job.R` (FigureÂ [2](#code:job.R)), defines the code to run a
particular task, `ntask` times.

In this example, the `job()` function begins by generating a sample of
`param` exponential random variables with mean 1. A one-sample t-test is
conducted on this sample and logical (`TRUE/FALSE`) values denoting
whether the test rejected in that tail are saved in the vectors
`leftreject` and `rightreject`. This process is repeated `ntask` times,
after which `job()` returns a data frame with the rejection results and
the corresponding sample size.

The folder `input` also contains `runjob.R`

generated by `xgrid()` and passes them to `job()`. The results from the
completed job are saved as `res0`, which is subsequently saved to the

The next item in the directory structure is `simulation.R`
(FigureÂ [4](#code:simulation.R)), which contains R code to be run on the
client machine using `source()`. The call to `xgrid()` submits the
simulation to the grid for calculation, which includes passing `param`
and `ntask` to `job()` within `job.R`. Results from all jobs are
returned as one data frame, `res`. The call to `with()` summarizes all
results in a table and prints them to the console.

Here we specify a total of $10^6$ simulation iterations, to be split
into twenty jobs of $5 \times 10^4$ simulations each. Note that the
number of jobs is calculated as the total number of simulation
iterations (`numsim`) divided by the number of tasks per job (`ntask`).
Each simulation iteration has a sample size of `param`.

The final item in the directory structure is `output`. Initially empty,
results returned from the grid are saved here (this directory is
automatically created if it does not already exist).

Figure [5](#fig:input2) displays the file structure within the directory
used to access the Xgrid.

Jobs are submitted to the grid by running `simulation.R`. In this
particular simulation, twenty jobs are submitted. As jobs are completed,
the results are saved in the `output` folder then removed from the grid.

Figures [6](#fig:input3) and [7](#fig:input4) display management tools
available using the Xgrid Admin interface.

In addition to returning a data frame ($10^6$ rows and 3 columns) with
the collated results, the `xgrid()` function saves this object as a file
(by default as `res` in the file `RESULTS.rds`).

  true data derive from 4 distinct and equiprobable classes, simulation
  sample size 300), reprinted from @swanson. Note that a perfect
  criterion would have "100%" under class 4.
:::

In terms of our motivating example, when the underlying data are
normally distributed, we would expect to reject the null hypothesis 2.5%
of the time on the left and 2.5% on the right. The simulation yielded
rejection rates of 6.5% and 0.7% for left and right, respectively. This
confirms Hesterberg's argument regarding lack of robustness for both the
overall $\alpha$-level as well as the individual tails.

Regarding computation time, this simulation took 48.2 seconds (standard
deviation of 0.7 seconds) when run on a heterogeneous mixture of twenty
iMacs and Mac Pros. When run locally on a single quad-core Intel Xeon
Mac Pro computer, this simulation took 592 seconds (standard deviation
of 0.4 seconds).

## Example 2: Fitting latent class models using add-on packages

Our second example is more realistic, as it involves simulations that
would ordinarily take days to complete (as opposed to seconds for the
one-sample t-test). It involves study of the properties of latent class
models, which are used to determine better schemes for classification of
eating disorders [@keel]. The development of an empirically-created
eating disorder classification system is of public health interest as it
may help identify individuals who would benefit from diagnosis and
treatment.

As described by @collinslanza, latent class analysis (LCA) is used to
identify subgroups in a population. There are several criteria used to
evaluate the fit of a given model, including the Akaike Information
Criterion (AIC), the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC), the
Consistent Akaike Information Criterion (cAIC), and the Sample Size
Adjusted Bayesian Information Criterion (aBIC). These criteria are
useful, but further guidance is needed for researchers to choose between
them, as well as better understand how their accuracy is affected by
methodological factors encountered in eating disorder classification
research, such as unbalanced class size, sample size, missing data, and
under- or overspecification of the model. @swanson undertook a
comprehensive review of these model criteria, including a full
simulation study to generate hypothetical data sets, and investigated
how each criterion behaved in a variety of statistical environments. For
this example, we replicate some of their simulations using an Apple
Xgrid to speed up computation time.

Following the approach of Swanson et al., we generated "true models"
where we specified an arbitrary four-class structure (with balanced
number of observations in each class). This structure was composed of 10
binary indicators in a simulated data set of size 300. The model was
fitted using the `poLCA()` function of the
[*poLCA*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=poLCA) (polytomous latent
class analysis) package [@poLCA]. Separate latent class models were
fitted specifying the number of classes, ranging from two to six. For
each simulation, we determined the lowest values of BIC, AIC, cAIC and
aBIC and recorded the class structure associated with that value.

Swanson and colleagues found that for this set of parameter values, the
AIC and aBIC picked the correct number of classes more than half the
time (see Table [2](#tab:poLCAresults)).

This example illustrates the computational burden of undertaking
simulation studies to assess the performance of modern statistical
methods, as several minutes are needed to undertake each of the single
iterations of the simulation (which may explain why Swanson and
colleagues only ran 100 simulations for each of their scenarios).

A complication of this example is that fitting LCA models in R requires
the use of add-on packages. For instance, we use *poLCA* and its
supporting packages with an Apple Xgrid to conduct our simulation. When
a simulation requires add-on packages, they must be preloaded within the
job and shipped over to the Xgrid. The specific steps of utilizing
add-on packages are provided in Appendix B.

### Simulation results

To better understand the potential performance gains when running
simulations on the grid, we assessed the relative performance of a
variety of grids with different characteristics and differing numbers of
tasks per job (since there is some overhead to the Apple Xgrid system).
One grid was a single quad-core Intel Xeon Mac Pro computer (two
quad-core processors, for total of 8 processors, each rated at 3 GHz,
total 24 GHz). The other was a grid of eleven rack-mounted quad-core
Intel servers (a total of 88 processors, each rated at 2.8 GHz, total
246.4 GHz). For comparison, we also ran the job directly within R on the
Mac Pro computer (equivalent to `ntask = 1000, numjobs = 1`), as well as
on the 88 processor grid but restricting the number of active jobs to 66
or 77 using the `throttle` option within `xgrid()`. For each setup, we
varied the number of tasks (`ntask`) while maintaining 1,000 simulations
for each scenario (`ntask * numjobs = 1000`).

For simulations with a relatively small number of tasks per job and a
large number of jobs, the time to submit them to the grid controller can
be measured in minutes; this overhead may be nontrivial. Also, for
simulations on a quiescent grid where the number of jobs is not evenly
divisible by the number of available processors, some part of the grid
may be idle near the end of the simulation and the elapsed time longer
than necessary.

Each simulation was repeated three times and the mean and standard
deviation of total elapsed time (in hours) was recorded. Table
[3](#tab:timingresults) displays the results.

As expected, there was considerable speedup by using the grid. When
moving from a single processor to 8, we were able to speed up our
simulation by 34 hours -- a 78% decrease in elapsed time
\[(43.98-9.84)/43.98\]. We saw an even larger decrease of 98% when
moving to 88 (somewhat slower) processors. There were only modest
differences in the elapsed time comparing different configurations of
the number of tasks per job and number of jobs, indicating that the
overhead of the system imposes a relatively small cost. Once the job
granularity is sufficiently fine, performance change is minimal.

# Summary

We have described an implementation of a "grid stuffer" that can be used
to access an Apple Xgrid from within R. Xgrid is an attractive platform
for scientific computing because it can be easily set up, and it handles
tedious housekeeping and collation of results from large simulations
with relatively minimal effort. Core technologies in Mac OS X and easily
available extensions simplify the process of creating a grid. An Xgrid
may be configured with little knowledge of advanced networking
technologies or disruption of networking activities.

Another attractive feature of this environment is that the Xgrid
degrades gracefully. If an individual agent fails, then the controller
will automatically resubmit the job to another agent. Once all of the
submitted jobs are queued up on a controller, the `xgrid()` function can
handle temporary controller failures (if the controller restarts then
all pending and running jobs will be restarted automatically). If the
client crashes, the entire simulation must be restarted. It may be
feasible to keep track of this state to allow more fault tolerance in a
future release.

A limitation of the Apple Xgrid system is that it is proprietary, which
may limit its use. A second limitation is that it requires some effort
on the part of the user to structure their program in a manner that can
be divided into chunks then reassembled. Because of the relatively thin
communication connections between the client and controller, the user is
restricted to passing configuration via command line arguments in R,
which must be parsed by the agent. Results are then passed back via the
filesystem. In addition to the need for particular files to be created
that can be run on the client as well as on the controller, use of the
Apple Xgrid system may also require separate installation of additional
packages needed for the simulation (particularly if the user does not
have administrative access or control of the individual agents).

However, as demonstrated by our simulation studies, the Apple Xgrid
system is particularly well-suited for embarrassingly parallel problems
(e.g.Â simulation studies with multiple independent runs). It can be set
up on a heterogeneous set of machines (such as a computer classroom) and
configured to run when these agents are idle. For such a setup, the
overall process load tends to balance if the simulation is broken up
into sufficiently fine grained jobs, as faster agents will take on more
than their share of jobs.

The Xgrid software is available as an additional download for Apple
users as part of Mac OS X Server, and it is straightforward to set up a
grid using existing computers (instructions are provided in Appendix C).
In our tests, it took approximately 30 minutes to set up an Apple Xgrid
on a simple network consisting of three computers.

Our implementation provides for three distinct authentication schemes
(Kerberos, clear text password, or none). While the Xgrid system
provides full support for authentication using Kerberos, this requires
more configuration and is beyond the scope of this paper. The system
documentation [@AppleXgridSystem] provides a comprehensive review of
administration using this mechanism. If the `auth = "Password"` option
is used, then the `XGRID_CONTROLLER_PASSWORD` environment variable must
be set by the user to specify the password. As with any shared
networking resource, care should be taken when less secure approaches
are used to access the controller and agents. Firewalling the Xgrid
controller and agents from outside networks may be warranted.

There are a number of areas of potential improvement for this interface.
It may be feasible to create a single XML file to allow all of the
simulations to be included as multiple tasks within a single job. This
has the potential to decrease input/output load and simplify monitoring.

As described previously, the use of parallel computing to speed up
scientific computation using R by use of multiple cores, tightly
connected clusters, and other approaches remains an active area of
research. Other approaches exist, though address different issues. For
example, the *GridR* package does not support access through the `xgrid`
command and requires access to individual agents. The *runjags* package
provides an alternative interface that is particularly well suited for
Bayesian estimation using Gibbs sampling.

Our setup focuses on a simple (but common) problem: embarrassingly
parallel computations that can be chopped into multiple tasks or jobs.
The ability to dramatically speed up such simulations within R by
running them on a designated grid (or less formally on a set of idle
machines) may be an attractive option in many settings with Apple
computers.

# Glossary

Agent

:   A member of a grid that performs tasks distributed to it by the
    controller (also known as a node). An agent can be its own
    controller.

Apple Remote Desktop (ARD)

:   An application that allows a user to monitor or control networked
    computers remotely.

Bonjour networking

:   Apple's automatic network service discovery and configuration tool.
    Built on a variety of commonly used networking protocols, Bonjour
    allows Mac computers to easily communicate with each other and with
    a large number of compatible devices, with little to no user
    configuration required.

Client

:   A computer that submits jobs to the controller for grid processing.

Controller

:   A computer (running OS X Server or XgridLite) that accepts jobs from
    clients and distributes them to agents. A controller can also be an
    agent within the grid.

Embarassingly parallel

:   A computation that can be divided into a series of independent tasks
    where little or no communication is required.

Grid

:   More general than an Apple Xgrid, a group of machines (agents),
    managed by a controller, which accept and perform computational
    tasks.

Grid stuffer

:   An application that submit jobs and retrieves their results through
    the `xgrid` command. The `xgrid()` function within the *xgrid*
    package implements a grid stuffer in R.

Job

:   A group of one or more tasks submitted by a client to the
    controller.

Mac OS X Server

:   A Unix server operating system from Apple, that provides advanced
    features for operating an Xgrid controller (for those without Mac OS
    X Server, the XgridLite panel provides similar functionality for
    grid computing).

plist file

:   Short for "property list file". On Mac OS computers, this is an XML
    file that stores user- or system-defined settings for an application
    or extension. For example, the "Preferences" pane in an application
    is linked to a plist file such that when Preferences are changed,
    their values are recorded in the plist file, to be read by other
    parts of the application when running.

Preference pane

:   Any of the sections under the Mac OS X System Preferences, each
    controlling a different aspect of the operating system (desktop
    background, energy saving preferences, etc.) or of user-installed
    programs. XgridLite is a preference pane, since it is simply a GUI
    for core system tools (such as the `xgridctl` command).

Processor core

:   Independent processors in the same CPU. Most modern computers have
    multi-core CPUs, usually with 2 or 4 cores. Multi-core systems can
    execute more tasks simultaneously (in our case, multiple R runs at
    the same time). Multi-core systems are often able to manage tasks
    more efficiently, since less time is spent waiting for a core to be
    ready to process data.

Task

:   Sub-components of jobs. A job may contain many tasks, each of which
    can be performed individually, or may depend on the results of other
    tasks or jobs.

Xgrid

:   Software and distributed computing protocol developed by Apple that
    allows networked computers to contribute to distributed
    computations.

XgridLite

:   Preference pane authored by Ed Baskerville. A free GUI to access
    Xgrid functionality that is built into all Mac OS X computers. Also
    facilitates configuration of controllers (similar functionality is
    provided by Mac OS X Server).

# Appendix A: Accessing the Apple Xgrid using R

This section details the steps needed to access an existing Xgrid using
R. All commands are executed on the client.

## Install the package from CRAN

The first step is to install the package from CRAN on the client
computer (needs to be done only once)

``` r
install.packages("xgrid")
```

## Determine hostname and access information for the Apple Xgrid

The next step is to determine the access procedures for your particular
grid. These include the hostname (specified as the `grid` option) and
authorization scheme (specified as the `auth` option).

## Create directory and file structure

An overview of the required directory structure is provided in
FigureÂ [5](#fig:input2).

The `input` folder contains two files, `job.R` and `runjob.R`. The file
`job.R` contains the definition for the function `job()`. This function
expects two arguments: `ntask`, which specifies the number of tasks per
job, and `param`, used to define any parameter of interest. Note that
`job()` must have `ntask` and `param` as arguments, but can be modified
to take more. This function returns a data frame, where each row is the
result of one task. The file `runjob.R` (running on the agent) receives
three arguments when called by `xgrid()` (running on the client):
`ntask`, `param`, and `resfile` (see description of `simulation.R`
below). The arguments `ntask` and `param` are passed to `job()`, and the
data frame returned by `job()` is saved to the folder `output`, with
filename specified by `resfile`.

The folder `output` will contain the results from the simulations. If
created manually, it should be empty. If not created manually, the
function `xgrid()` will create it.

The script `simulation.R` accesses the controller by calling `xgrid()`
and allows the user to override any default arguments.

### Call `xgrid()` within `simulation.R`

After loading the *xgrid* package and calling the `xgrid()` function as
described in `simulation.R`, results from all `numsim` simulations are
collated and returned as the object `res`. This object is also saved as
the file `RESULTS.rds`, at the root of the directory structure. This can
be analyzed as needed.

# Appendix B: Using additional packages with the Apple Xgrid

One of the strengths of R is the large number of add-on packages that
extend the system. If the user of the grid has administrative privileges
on the individual machines then any needed packages can be installed in
the usual manner.

However, if no administrative access is available, it is possible to
utilize such packages within this setup by manually installing them in
the `input/rlibs` directory and loading them within a given job.

This appendix details how to make a package available to a job running
on a given agent.

1.  Install the appropriate distribution file from CRAN into the
    directory `input/rlibs`. This can be done by using the `lib`
    argument of `install.packages()`. For instance, in Example 2 we can
    install *poLCA* by using the call
    `install.packages("poLCA", lib = "~/.../input/rlibs")`, where
    `~/.../` emphasizes use of the absolute path to the `rlibs`
    directory.

2.  Access the add-on package within a job running on an agent. This is
    done by using the `lib.loc` option within the standard invocation of
    `library()`. For instance, in Example 2 this can be done by using
    the call `library(poLCA, lib.loc="./rlibs")`.

It should be noted that the package will need to be shipped over to the
agent for each job, which may be less efficient than installing the
package once per agent in the usual manner (but the latter option may
not be available unless the grid user has administrative access to the
individual agents).

# Appendix C: Xgrid setup

In this section we discuss the steps required to set up a new Xgrid
using XgridLite under Mac OS X 10.6 or 10.7. We presume some background
in system administration and note that installation of a grid will
likely require the assistance of technical staff.

Depending on the nature of the network and machines involved, different
Xgrid-related tools can be used, including Mac OS X Server and
XgridLite. Mac OS X Server has several advantages, but for the purposes
of this paper, we restrict our attention to XgridLite.

## Anatomy of an Apple Xgrid

It is important to understand the flow of information through an Apple
Xgrid and the relationship between the different computers involved. The
centerpoint of an Apple Xgrid is the controller (Figure
[1](#fig:input1)). When clients submit jobs to the grid, the controller
distributes them to agents, which make themselves available to the
controller on the local network (using Apple's Bonjour network
discovery). That is, rather than the controller keeping a master list of
which agents are part of the grid, agents detect the presence of a
controller on the network and, depending on their configuration, make
themselves available for job processing.

This loosely coupled grid structure means that if an agent previously
involved in computation is unavailable, the controller simply passes
jobs to other agents. This functionality is known as graceful
degradation. Once an agent has completed its computation, the results
are made available to the controller, where the client can retrieve
them. As a result, the client never communicates directly with agents,
only with the controller.

## Downloading XgridLite

XgridLite (<http://edbaskerville.com/software/xgridlite>) is free and
open-source software, released under the GNU GPL (general public
license), and installed as a Mac OS X preference pane. Once it is
installed, it is found in the "Other" section (at the bottom) of the
System Preferences (Apple menu $\rightarrow$ System Preferences).

## Downloading server tools

Although not necessary to install and operate an Apple Xgrid, the free
Apple software suite called Mac OS X Server Tools is extremely useful.
In particular, the Xgrid Admin application (see Figure [6](#fig:input3))
allows for the monitoring of any number of Apple Xgrids, including
statistics on the grid such as the number of agents and total processing
power, as well as a list of jobs which can be paused, stopped,
restarted, and deleted. Most "grid stuffers" (our system included) are
designed to clean up after themselves, so the job management functions
in Xgrid Admin are primarily useful for monitoring the status of jobs.

## Setting up a controller

Figure [8](#fig:controller) displays the process of setting up a grid
controller within XgridLite. To start the Xgrid controller service,
simply click the "Start" button. Authentication settings are configured
with the "Set Client Password\..." and "Set Agent Password\..." buttons.
From the XgridLite panel, you can also reset the controller or turn it
off.

![Figure 8: Setting up a
controller](images/xgridlite.png){#fig:controller width="100%"
alt="graphic without alt text"}

Unlike many other client-server relationships, the Xgrid controller
authenticates to the client, rather than the other way around. That is,
the password entered in the XgridLite "Set Agent Password\..." field is
*provided* to agents, not required of them. Individual agents must be
configured to require that particular password (or none at all) in order
to join the Xgrid.

## Setting up agents

To set up an agent to join the Xgrid, open the Sharing preferences pane
("Internet & Wireless" section in OS 10.6) in System Preferences (see
Figures [9](#fig:sharing1) and [10](#fig:sharing2)). Select the "Xgrid
Sharing" item in the list on the left. Click the "Configure\..." button.
From here, you can choose whether the agent should join the first
available Xgrid, or a specific one. The latter of these options is
usually best -- the drop-down menu of controllers will auto-populate
with all that are currently running.

![Figure 9: Sharing setup to configure an agent for
Xgrid](images/sharingprefs1.png){#fig:sharing1 width="100%"
alt="graphic without alt text"}

![Figure 10: Specifying the controller for an
agent](images/sharingprefs2.png){#fig:sharing2 width="100%"
alt="graphic without alt text"}

If there are multiple controllers on a network, you may want to choose
one specifically so that the agent does not default to a different one.
You may also choose whether or not the agent should accept tasks when
idle. Then click "Done" and choose the desired authentication method
(most likely "Password" or \[less advisable\] "None") in the main
window. If applicable, enter the password that will be required of the
controller. Then, select the checkbox next to the "Xgrid Sharing" item
on the left. The agent needs to be restarted to complete the process.

Note that a controller can also be an agent within its grid. However, it
is important to consider that if the controller is also an agent, this
has the potential to slow a simulation.

## Automation

For those with more experience in system administration and access to
Apple Remote Desktop (ARD) or secure shell (SSH) on the agent machines
(or work with an administrator who does), the process of setting up
agents can be automated. R can be installed remotely (allowing you to be
sure that it is installed in the same location on each machine), the
file that contains Xgrid agent settings can be pushed to all agents and,
finally, the agent service can be activated. We will not discuss the ARD
remote package installation process in detail here, but a full
explanation can be found in the Apple Remote Desktop Administrator Guide
at <http://images.apple.com/remotedesktop/pdf/ARD_Admin_Guide_v3.3.pdf>.

The settings for the Xgrid agent service are stored in the plist file
located at `/Library/Preferences/com.apple.xgrid.agent.plist`. These
settings include authentication options, controller binding, and the
number of physical processor cores the agent should report to the
controller (see the note below for a discussion of this value, which is
significant). The simplest way to automate the creation of an Apple
Xgrid is to configure the agent service on a specific computer with the
desired settings and then push the above plist file to the same relative
location on all agents. Keep the processor core settings in mind; you
may need to push different versions of the file to different agents in a
heterogeneous grid (see Note 3 below). Once all agents have the proper
plist file, run the commands `xgridctl agent enable` and
`xgridctl agent on` on the agents.

## Notes

1.  Mac OS X Server provides several additional options for setting up
    an Xgrid controller. These include Kerberos authentication and
    customized Xgrid cache files location. Depending on your network
    setup, these features may bolster security, but we will not explore
    them further here.

2.  R **must** be installed in the same location on each agent. If it is
    installed locally by an end-user, it should default to the proper
    location, but it is worth verifying this before running tasks,
    otherwise they may fail. As mentioned previously, installing R
    remotely using ARD is an easy way to ensure an identical
    instantiation on each agent.

3.  The reported number of processor cores (the `ProcessorCount`
    attribute) is significant because the controller considers it the
    maximum number of tasks the agent can execute simultaneously. On Mac
    OS X 10.6, agents by default report the number of cores (not
    processors) that they have (see discussion at
    <http://lists.apple.com/archives/Xgrid-users/2009/Oct/msg00001.html>).
    The `ProcessorCount` attribute can be modified depending on the
    nature of the grid. Since R uses only 1 processor per core, this may
    leave many processors idle if the default behavior is not modified.

4.  Because Xgrid jobs are executed as the user "nobody" on grid agents,
    they are given lower priority if the CPU is not idle.
