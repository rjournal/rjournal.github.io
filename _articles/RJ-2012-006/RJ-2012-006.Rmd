title: 'xgrid and R: Parallel Distributed Processing Using Heterogeneous Groups of
  Apple Computers'
abstract: The Apple Xgrid system provides access to groups (or grids) of computers
  that can be used to facilitate parallel processing. We describe the xgrid package
  which facilitates access to this system to undertake independent simulations or
  other long-running jobs that can be divided into replicate runs within R. Detailed
  examples are provided to demonstrate the interface, along with results from a simulation
  study of the performance gains using a variety of grids. Use of the grid for “embarassingly
  parallel” independent jobs has the potential for major speedups in time to completion.
  Appendices provide guidance on setting up the workflow, utilizing add-on packages,
  and constructing grids using existing machines.
