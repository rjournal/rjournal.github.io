title: 'Vdgraph: A Package for Creating Variance Dispersion Graphs'
abstract: This article introduces the package Vdgraph that is used for making variance
  dispersion graphs of response surface designs. The package includes functions that
  make the variance dispersion graph of one design or compare variance dispersion
  graphs of two designs, which are stored in data frames or matrices. The package
  also contains several minimum run response surface designs (stored as matrices)
  that are not available in other R packages.
