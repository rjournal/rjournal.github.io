title: 'Vdgraph: A Package for Creating Variance Dispersion Graphs'
abstract: This article introduces the package [*Vdgraph*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=Vdgraph)
  that is used for making variance dispersion graphs of response surface designs.
  The package includes functions that make the variance dispersion graph of one design
  or compare variance dispersion graphs of two designs, which are stored in data frames
  or matrices. The package also contains several minimum run response surface designs
  (stored as matrices) that are not available in other R packages.

# Introduction

Response surface methods consist of (1) experimental designs for
collecting data to fit an approximate relationship between the factors
and the response, (2) regression analyses for fitting the model and (3)
graphical and numerical techniques for examining the fitted model to
identify the optimum. The model normally used in response surface
analysis is a second order polynomial, as shown in Equation
(\@ref(eq:eq1)).

$$y=\beta_0+\sum_{i=1}^{k} \beta_i x_i +\sum_{i=1}^{k} \beta_{ii} x_i^2+\sum \sum_{i<j}^{k} \beta_{ij}x_ix_j
\label{eq:eq1}  (\#eq:eq1)  $$

The fitted equation is examined in order to predict the factor
coordinates of the maximum or minimum response within the experimental
region, or to simply explore the relationship between the factors and
response.

Since it is not known in advance what neighborhood will be of most
interest in the design space, a desirable response surface design will
be one that makes the variance of a predicted value as uniform as
possible throughout the experimental region. Standard response surface
designs, such as the uniform precision central composite design, are
constructed so that the variance of a predicted value will be near
constant within a coded radius of one from the center of the design.

One way to visualize the uniformity of the variance of a predicted value
for designs with more than two factors is to use the variance dispersion
graph proposed by
@RH:Myers+GG:Vining+A:Giovannitti-Jensen+SL:Myers:1992.

# Variance of a predicted value

The variance of a predicted value at a point $(x_1,\cdots,x_k)$ in the
experimental region is given by Equation (\@ref(eq:eq2))
$$\label{eq:eq2}
\text{Var}[\hat{y}(\mathbf{x})]=\sigma^2 \mathbf{x}^{\prime}(\mathbf{X}^{\prime} \mathbf{X})^{-1} \mathbf{x}  (\#eq:eq2)  $$
where $\mathbf{X}$ is the design matrix for the quadratic model in
Equation (\@ref(eq:eq1)), $\sigma^2$ is the variance of the experimental
error, and
$$\mathbf{x}=[1,x_1,\cdots,x_k,x_1^2,\cdots,x_k^2,x_1x_2,\cdots]$$ is a
vector valued function of the coordinates (of the point in the
experimental region) whose elements correspond to the columns of the
design matrix $\mathbf{X}$.

  : Table 1: Face Center Cube Design or $3^2$ Design
:::

For the face-centered cube design, or $3^2$ design shown in Table
[1](#tab:t1), Figure [1](#figure:onecolfig1) is a contour plot of the
scaled variance of a predicted value in the range of
$-1.5\leq x_1 \leq1.5, -1.5\leq x_2 \leq1.5$. The scaled variance of a
predicted value is $N\text{Var}[\hat{y}(\mathbf{x})]/\sigma^2$, where
$N$ is the number of points in the experimental design.

![Figure 1: Contour plot of
$N\text{Var}[\hat{y}(\mathbf{x})]/\sigma^2$](ContourNew.png){#figure:onecolfig1
width="100%" alt="graphic without alt text"}

As seen in Figure [1](#figure:onecolfig1), the variance of a predicted
value increases faster along the line $x_2=0$ than along the line
$x_2=-x_1$. This is easy to visualize in two dimensions, but would be
more difficult to see in higher dimensions.

# Variance dispersion graphs

A variance dispersion graph allows one to visualize the uniformity of
the scaled variance of a predicted value in multidimensional space. It
consists of three curves: the maximum, the minimum and the average
scaled variance of a predicted value on a hypersphere. Each value is
plotted against the radius of the hypersphere. Figure
[2](#figure:onecolfig2) shows the variance dispersion graph of the
design shown in Table [1](#tab:t1).

In this figure it can be seen that the maximum scaled variance of a
predicted value is near 14 at a radius of 1.4 in coded units, while the
minimum scaled variance is less than 10 at the same radius. This is the
same phenomenon that can be seen in the contour plot of the scaled
variance of a predicted value shown in Figure [1](#figure:onecolfig1).
The path of the maximum and minimum variance through the design space
will be determined by the design and may not follow straight lines as
shown in the specific example in this contour plot.

![Figure 2: Variance dispersion graph for the design in Table
1.](Vdgrapha.png){#figure:onecolfig2 width="100%" alt="graphic without alt text"}

Unlike the contour plot of the scaled prediction variance, the variance
dispersion graph has the same format for a $k$ dimensional response
surface design as for a two dimensional design like Table [1](#tab:t1).

Recent textbooks such as @DC:Montgomery:2005,
@RH:Myers+DC:Montgomery:2009, and @Lawson:2010 illustrate variance
dispersion graphs as a tool for judging the merits of a response surface
design. These graphs can be produced in commercial software such as *SAS
ADX* [see @SAS:2010] and *Minitab* [see @Minitab:2010] by using a
downloadable macro [see @Santiago:2009].

# The Vdgraph package

@G:Vining:1993, and @G:Vining:1993b published FORTRAN code for creating
variance dispersion graphs. Vining's code obtains the maximum and
minimum prediction variance on hyperspheres using a combination of a
grid search and Nelder-Mead search as described by [@CookNacht:1980].
The package [*Vdgraph*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=Vdgraph)
[@Vd:2011] incorporates this code in R functions that make the graphs.

The package includes the function `Vdgraph` for making a variance
dispersion graph of one design and the function `Compare2Vdg` for
comparing the variance dispersion graphs of two designs on the same
plot. The package also includes several minimum run response surface
designs stored as matrices. These include Hartley's small composite
design for 2 to 6 factors, Draper and Lin's small composite design for 5
factors, the hexagonal rotatable design for 2 factors and Roquemore's
hybrid designs for 3 to 6 factors.

# Examples

The first example shown below illustrates the use of the R function
`Vdgraph` to make variance dispersion graphs of a three factor
Box-Behnken design created by the `bbd` function in the R package
[*rsm*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=rsm) [see @Lenth:2009].

The result from the first example (shown above) includes a listing of
the coordinates of the plot and the graph shown in Figure
[3](#figure:onecolfig3).

The second example illustrates the use of `Compare2Vdg` by comparing the
variance dispersion graph of Draper and Lin's small composite design for
5 factors (`SCDDL5`) [@DrapLin:1990] with Hartley's Small Composite
Design (`SCDH5`) [@Hartley:1959]. Hartley's small composite design
requires only 28 runs by utilizing a $\frac{1}{2}$ fraction of the
factorial portion of the design.

  : Table 2: Draper and Lin"s Small Composite Design for 5 Factors
:::

Although Draper and Lin's design (shown in Table [2](#tab:t2) with
$\alpha=1.86121$) further reduces the number of runs to 23, by
substituting a 12 run Plackett-Burman design in the factorial portion,
its variance dispersion graph reveals that the variance of a predicted
value is not nearly as uniform as it is for the Hartley's design.

``` r
> data(SCDH5)
> data(SCDDL5)
> Compare2Vdg("Hartley's Small Composite-5 fac",SCDH5,
> +"Draper and Lin's Small Composite-5 fac",SCDDL5)
```

![Figure 4: Comparison of Two Variance Dispersion
Graphs.](CompVdg.png){#figure:onecolfig4 width="100%" alt="graphic without alt text"}

As seen in Figure [4](#figure:onecolfig4), Hartley's small composite
design for 5 factors is rotatable since the three blue curves for the
max, min and average scaled prediction variance coincide. The scaled
variance of a predicted value for Hartley's design is near the minimum
scaled variance of a predicted value for Draper and Lin's design
throughout the experimental region.
