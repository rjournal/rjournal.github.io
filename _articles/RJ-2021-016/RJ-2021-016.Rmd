title: 'NTS: An R Package for Nonlinear Time Series Analysis'
abstract: Linear time series models are commonly used in analyzing dependent data
  and in forecasting. On the other hand, real phenomena often exhibit nonlinear behavior
  and the observed data show nonlinear dynamics. This paper introduces the R package
  NTS that offers various computational tools and nonlinear models for analyzing nonlinear
  dependent data. The package fills the gaps of several outstanding R packages for
  nonlinear time series analysis. Specifically, the NTS package covers the implementation
  of threshold autoregressive (TAR) models, autoregressive conditional mean models
  with exogenous variables (ACMx), functional autoregressive models, and state-space
  models. Users can also evaluate and compare the performance of different models
  and select the best one for prediction. Furthermore, the package implements flexible
  and comprehensive sequential Monte Carlo methods (also known as particle filters)
  for modeling non-Gaussian or nonlinear processes. Several examples are used to demonstrate
  the capabilities of the NTS package.
