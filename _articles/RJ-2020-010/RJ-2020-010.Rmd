title: 'gk: An R Package for the g-and-k and Generalised g-and-h Distributions'
abstract: 'The g-and-k and (generalised) g-and-h distributions are flexible univariate
  distributions which can model highly skewed or heavy tailed data through only four
  parameters: location and scale, and two shape parameters influencing the skewness
  and kurtosis. These distributions have the unusual property that they are defined
  through their quantile function (inverse cumulative distribution function) and their
  density is unavailable in closed form, which makes parameter inference complicated.
  This paper presents the gk R package to work with these distributions. It provides
  the usual distribution functions and several algorithms for inference of independent
  identically distributed data, including the finite difference stochastic approximation
  method, which has not been used before for this problem.'
