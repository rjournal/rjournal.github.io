title: Who Did What? The Roles of R Package Authors and How to Refer to Them
abstract: 'Computational infrastructure for representing persons and citations has
  been available in R for several years, but has been restructured through enhanced
  classes "person" and "bibentry" in recent versions of R. The new features include
  support for the specification of the roles of package authors (e.g. maintainer,
  author, contributor, translator, etc.) and more flexible formatting/printing tools
  among various other improvements. Here, we introduce the new classes and their methods
  and indicate how this functionality is employed in the management of R packages.
  Specifically, we show how the authors of R packages can be specified along with
  their roles in package ‘DESCRIPTION’ and/or ‘CITATION’ files and the citations produced
  from it. R packages are the result of scholarly activity and as such constitute
  scholarly resources which must be clearly identifiable for the respective scientific
  communities and, more generally, today’s information society. In particular, packages
  published by standard repositories can be regarded as reliable sources which can
  and should be referenced (i.e. cited) by scientific works such as articles or other
  packages. This requires conceptual frameworks and computational infrastructure for
  describing bibliographic resources, general enough to encompass the needs of communities
  with an interest in R. These needs include support for exporting bibliographic metadata
  in standardized formats such as BIBTEX (Berry and Patashnik, 2010), but also facilitating
  bibliometric analyses and investigations of the social fabric underlying the creation
  of scholarly knowledge. The latter requires a richer vocabulary than commonly employed
  by reference management software such as BIBTEX, identifying persons and their roles
  in relation to bibliographic resources. For example, a thesis typically has an author
  and advisors. Software can have an (original) author and a translator to another
  language (such as from S to R). The maintainer of an R package is not necessarily
  an author. In this paper, we introduce the base R infrastructure (as completely
  available in R since version 2.14.0) for representing and manipulating such scholarly
  data: objects of class "person" (hereafter, per son objects) hold information about
  persons, possibly including their roles; objects of class "bibentry" (hereafter,
  bibentry objects) hold bibliographic information in enhanced BIBTEX style, ideally
  using person objects when referring to persons (such as authors or editors). Furthermore,
  we indicate how this functionality is employed in the management of R packages,
  in particular in their ‘CITATION’ and ‘DESCRIPTION’ files.'
