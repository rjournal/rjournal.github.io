title: Retrieval and Analysis of Eurostat Open Data with the eurostat Package
abstract: The increasing availability of open statistical data resources is providing
  novel opportunities for research and citizen science. Efficient algorithmic tools
  are needed to realize the full potential of the new information resources. We introduce
  the eurostat R package that provides a collection of custom tools for the Eurostat
  open data service, including functions to query, download, manipulate, and visualize
  these data sets in a smooth, automated and reproducible manner. The online documentation
  provides detailed examples on the analysis of these spatio-temporal data collections.
  This work provides substantial improvements over the previously available tools,
  and has been extensively tested by an active user community. The eurostat R package
  contributes to the growing open source ecosystem dedicated to reproducible research
  in computational social science and digital humanities.
