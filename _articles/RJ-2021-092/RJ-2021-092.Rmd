# Introduction

Single-index quantile regression [@wu_single-index_2010] generalizes the
seminal work of linear quantile regression of [@koenker_regression_1978]
by projecting the $d$-dimensional covariate $\textbf{ x}$ to a
univariate index $\textbf{ x}\mathbf{\beta}$ and allowing a flexible
univariate function $g(\textbf{ x}\mathbf{\beta}).$ Quantile regression
is often of great interest, especially when heterogeneity is present.
Applications lie in a variety of fields, such as growth curves and
reference charts in medicine; survival analysis when a given covariate
may have a different effect on individuals with different levels of
risks; value at risk calculation and wage and income studies in
financial economics; high peak electricity demand in terms of weather
characteristics in utility and energy; modeling rainfall, river flow,
and air pollution in environmental modeling (see a survey
in@yu_quantile_2003).

Single-index quantile regression (SIQR) is a flexible semiparametric
quantile regression model for analyzing heterogeneous data. The SIQR
model has some appealing features: (i) It can provide a comprehensive
view of the conditional distribution of a response variable given
$d$-dimensional covariates by examining the full spectrum of conditional
quantiles. This is especially important for complex heterogeneous data.
(ii) The single-index structure is flexible to accommodate nonlinearity
while avoiding the curse of dimensionality. It can also implicitly model
some interactions among the covariates. Some interesting interpretations
of the single-index parameter may be preserved. (iii) The quantile
regression approach is robust to heavy-tailed distributions.

We present a package *SIQR* in R that implements the iterative local
linear approach to the single-index quantile regression in
[@wu_single-index_2010]. The unknown univariate function is estimated by
local linear estimation. The key algorithm can be decomposed into two
efficient estimation steps on augmented data through local linear
approximation and some equivalent formulation of the expected loss.
Essentially, it iterates between two linear quantile regressions
utilizing the state-of-the-art R package *quantreg*.

We apply our R package, *SIQR*, to the well-known Boston Housing data
(1978) that is available in the R default library. The data has a total
of 506 observations, and the response variable of interest is the median
price of owner-occupied homes on the census tracts in suburban Boston
from the 1970 census. The response variable and some covariates are
left-skewed. Clearly, quantile regression is a natural tool to analyze
the data (e.g., @chaudhuri_average_1997; @yu_local_2004;
@wu_single-index_2010; @kong_single-index_2012). We organize the rest of
the paper as follows. In the next section, we review the SIQR models.
Next, we discuss the estimation algorithms implemented in this package.
The section following describes the main features of the functions
provided. Section "Real Data Analysis and Simulation" illustrates the
use of *SIQR* in R for Boston housing data and a simulation study. The
last section concludes the paper.

# An overview for single-index quantile regression

## Data structure and model settings

We develop an R package for the single-index quantile regression for
semiparametric estimation with $d$-dimensional covariates. Let $Y$ be
the response variable and $\textbf{ X}$ be the covariate vector. Suppose
there are $n$ observations $\bigl\{(\textbf{ x}_i,y_i)\bigr\}_{i=1}^n$
of $(\textbf{ X}=\textbf{ x},Y=y)$. Given $\tau\in(0,1)$ and covariates
$\textbf{ x}_i$, the single-index quantile model for the $\tau$-th
conditional quantile of the $i$-th observation is
$$\label{eq:siqr}
q_{\tau}(Y=y_i | \textbf{ X}=\textbf{ x}_i) = g_\tau (\textbf{ x}_i \mathbf{\beta}_{\tau}),   (\#eq:siqr)$$
where $y_i$ is a real valued response, covariate $\textbf{ x}_i$ is a
$d$-dimensional row vector, the single-index parameter
$\mathbf{\beta}_{\tau}$ is a column vector in $\textbf{ R}^d$, and the
univariate function $g_{\tau}: \textbf{ R}\rightarrow \textbf{ R}$ is
subject to different $\tau$. For identifiability, the single index
parameter $\|\mathbf{\beta}_{\tau}\|= 1$ and the first non-zero element
of $\mathbf{\beta}_{\tau}$ is positive [@yu_penalized_2002]. The
projection $\textbf{ x}\mathbf{\beta}$ is often termed as the \"single
index\". When $g_{\tau}$ is linear, single-index quantile regression
model (\@ref(eq:siqr)) reduces to the seminal work of linear quantile
regression of [@koenker_regression_1978].

## Review of local linear estimation for single-index quantile regression {#sec:single-index-model}

We implement the local linear estimation for single-index quantile
regression (\@ref(eq:siqr)) [@wu_single-index_2010]. For notational
convenience, we omit the subscript $\tau$ in $g_\tau$ and
$\mathbf{\beta}_{\tau}$. The true parameter vector $\mathbf{\beta}$ is
the minimizer of
$$\label{eq loss1}
 E\left[\rho_\tau\left(y-g(\textbf{ x}\mathbf{\beta})\right)\right] ,   (\#eq:eq-loss1)$$
where $\rho_\tau(u)=|u|+(2\tau-1)u$ is the loss function, often termed
as the "check\" function in quantile regression. $g(\cdot)$ is the
unknown univariate function. Constraint
$\|\mathbf{\beta}\|=1, \beta_1>0$ is imposed for identifiability. The
above expected loss can be equivalently written as
$$\label{eq loss2}
E\left\{E\left[\rho_\tau\left(y-g(\textbf{ x}\mathbf{\beta})\right)|\textbf{ x}\mathbf{\beta}\right]\right\},   (\#eq:eq-loss2)$$
where
$E\left[\rho_\tau\left(y-g(\textbf{ x}\mathbf{\beta})\right)|\textbf{ x}\mathbf{\beta}\right]$
is the conditional expected loss and $g(\cdot)$ is the $\tau$th
conditional quantile given the single-index parameter $\mathbf{\beta}$.

We adopt a local linear approximation. In particular, for
$\textbf{ x}_i\mathbf{\beta}$ \"close" to $u$, we can approximate the
$\tau$th conditional quantile at $\textbf{ x}_i\mathbf{\beta}$ linearly
via
$$g(\textbf{ x}_i\mathbf{\beta})\approx g(u)+g'(u)(\textbf{ x}_i\mathbf{\beta}-u)=a+b(\textbf{ x}_i\mathbf{\beta}-u),$$
where we define $a{\equiv}g(u)$ and $b{\equiv}g'(u)$.

Now, we can minimize the sample analogue of (\@ref(eq:eq-loss1)) below
as in [@yu_local_1998] with respect to $(a, b)$ with local linear
estimation
$$\label{eq condloss}
  \sum_{i=1}^n\rho_\tau\left(y_i-a-b(\textbf{ x}_i\mathbf{\beta}-u)\right)K\left(\frac{\textbf{ x}_i\mathbf{\beta}-u}{h}\right),   (\#eq:eq-condloss)$$
where $K(\cdot)$ is the kernel function and $h$ is the bandwidth.

We further average (\@ref(eq:eq-condloss)) over $u$ and obtain the
sample analog of (\@ref(eq:eq-loss2)). The objective function below is
used to estimate our single-index quantile regression
modelÂ (\@ref(eq:siqr)),
$$\label{eq total loss}
\sum_{j=1}^n\sum_{i=1}^n\rho_\tau\left(y_i-a_j-b_j(\textbf{ x}_i\mathbf{\beta}-\textbf{ x}_j\mathbf{\beta})\right)\omega_{ij},   (\#eq:eq-total-loss)$$
where
$$\label{eq wij} \omega_{ij}=\frac{K_h(\textbf{ x}_i\mathbf{\beta}-\textbf{ x}_j\mathbf{\beta})}{\sum_{k=1}^n K_h(\textbf{ x}_k\mathbf{\beta}-\textbf{ x}_j\mathbf{\beta})}   (\#eq:eq-wij)$$
and $K_h(\cdot)=K(\cdot/h)/h.$ We implement minimizing
(\@ref(eq:eq-total-loss)) iteratively with a detailed algorithm
described next.

Bandwidth is a critical smoothing parameter that tunes the smoothness of
the fitted function in local estimation. We implement the choice of the
optimal bandwidth $h_\tau$ as advocated in [@wu_single-index_2010]
through a computationally-expedient rule-of-thumb:
$$\label{eq approx hp}
h_{\tau}=h_m\left\{\tau(1-\tau)/\phi\left(\Phi^{-1}(\tau)\right)^2\right\}^{1/5},   (\#eq:eq-approx-hp)$$
where $\phi(\cdot)$ is the probability density function and
$\Phi(\cdot)$ is the cumulative distribution function of the standard
normal distribution. Here,
$h_m= \Bigl\{ \frac{[ \int K^2(v)dv ] [var(y|\textbf{ x}\mathbf{\beta}=u)]}{n [ \int v^2 K(v)dv ]^2 [\frac{d^2}{d u^2}E(y|\textbf{ x}\mathbf{\beta}=u)]^2 [f_{U_0}(u)]} \Bigr\}^{1/5}$
is the optimal bandwidth in mean regression, which is easily obtainable
from many existing packages [@ruppert_effective_1995].

## Algorithm

We present the main algorithm for fitting the single-index quantile
regression (SIQR) with local linear estimation in detail as following:

**Input:** Quantile level $\tau\in(0,1)$, $d$-dimensional covariate
vector $\textbf{ X}=\mathbf{x}$, and a response vector $Y=\mathbf{y}$.\
**Output:** The estimated quantile single-index parameter
$\widehat{{\mathbf{\beta}}}_{\tau}$ and fitted conditional quantile
$\hat{q}_{\tau}(Y =\textbf{ y}| \textbf{ X}=\textbf{ x})$. The
univariate function estimate $\hat{g}_{\tau}(\cdot).$\

1.  Obtain an initial estimate $\hat{\mathbf{\beta}}^{(0)}$ of the
    quantile single-index parameter $\mathbf{\beta}$ from a linear
    quantile regression model (default) or a user-provided initial list.
    Standardize the initial estimate such that
    $||{\hat {\mathbf{\beta}}}^{(0)}||=1$ and
    ${\hat {\beta}}^{(0)}_1>0.$

2.  Given $\hat {\mathbf{\beta}}$, obtain
    $\{{\hat a}_j, {\hat b}_j\}_{j=1}^n$ by solving a series of the
    following
    $$\label{eq:step2}
    		\min_{(a_j, b_j)}\sum_{i=1}^n\rho_\tau\left(y_i-a_j-b_j(\textbf{ x}_i-\textbf{ x}_j){\hat{\mathbf{\beta}}}\right)\omega_{ij},   (\#eq:step2)$$
    where the weights $\omega_{ij}$ is defined in (\@ref(eq:eq-wij)).
    The bandwidth $h$ is chosen optimally following a rule-of-the-thumb
    criterion in (\@ref(eq:eq-approx-hp)).

3.  Given $\{{\hat a}_j, {\hat b}_j \}_{j=1}^n$, obtain
    ${\hat{\mathbf{\beta}}}$ by solving
    $$\label{eq:step3}
    \min_{\mathbf{\beta}}\sum_{j=1}^n\sum_{i=1}^n\rho_\tau\left(y_i-{\hat a}_j-{\hat b}_j (\textbf{ x}_i-\textbf{ x}_j)\mathbf{\beta}\right)\omega_{ij},    (\#eq:step3)$$
    with $\omega_{ij}$ evaluated at ${\mathbf{\beta}}$ and $h$ from step
    2.

4.  Repeat Steps 2 and 3 until convergence.

5.  Finally, we estimate $g(\cdot)$ at any $u$ by
    $\hat{g}(\cdot;h, \hat{\mathbf{\beta}})=\hat{a}$, where
    $$\label{eq final link}
    	    (\hat{a},\hat{b})=\arg\min_{(a, b)}\,\sum_{i=1}^n\rho_\tau\left(y_i-a-b(\textbf{ x}_i{\hat{\mathbf{\beta}}}-u)\right)K_h(\textbf{ x}_i\hat{\mathbf{\beta}}-u).   (\#eq:eq-final-link)$$
    Obtain the final fitted conditional quantile
    $\hat{q}_{\tau}(Y =\textbf{ y}| \textbf{ X}=\textbf{ x})$ from
    modelÂ (\@ref(eq:siqr)).

The above algorithm effectively decomposes (\@ref(eq:eq-total-loss))
into two steps that can be achieved by two standard linear quantile
regression procedures in Steps 2 and 3. In Step 3, we further note that
(\@ref(eq:step3)) can be written as
$$\begin{aligned}
	\hat{\mathbf{\beta}}&=&\arg\min_{\mathbf{\beta}} \sum_{j=1}^n\sum_{i=1}^n\rho_\tau\left(y_i-{\hat a}_j-{\hat b}_j(\textbf{ x}_i-\textbf{ x}_j)\mathbf{\beta}\right)\omega_{ij}
	\\&=&\arg\min_{\mathbf{\beta}}\sum_{j=1}^n\sum_{i=1}^n\rho_\tau\left(y_{ij}^*-{\textbf{ x}_{ij}^*}\mathbf{\beta}\right)\,\omega_{ij},
\end{aligned}$$
where $y_{ij}^*=y_i-{\hat a}_j$,
$\textbf{ x}_{ij}^*={\hat b}_j(\textbf{ x}_i-\textbf{ x}_j)$, and
$\omega_{ij}$ evaluated at the previous step, $i,j=1,\cdots,n$. Given
${\hat a}_j$'s and ${\hat b}_j$'s, we can estimate $\mathbf{\beta}$
through usual linear quantile regression without intercept
(*regression-through-origin*) on $n^2$ \"observations\"
$\{y_{ij}^*,{\textbf{ x}}_{ij}^*\}_{i,j=1}^n$ with known weights
$\{\omega_{ij}\}_{i,j=1}^n$ evaluated at the estimate of
$\mathbf{\beta}$ from the previous iteration.

We can see that (\@ref(eq:step3)) is an alternative to
(\@ref(eq:step2)). Adopting (\@ref(eq:step3)) yields some advantages:
(i) It uses all the data and is more efficient in estimation; (ii) The
double sum in (\@ref(eq:step3)) effectively increases the \"augmented\"
sample size to $n^2$, similar to the minimum average variance estimation
(MAVE) in the mean regression [@xia_semi-parametric_2006].

# The SIQR package

The R package *SIQR* consists of one core estimation function `siqr` and
some supporting functions such as visualization tool `plot.siqr` and
summary function `summary.siqr`. The R package SIQR depends on the R
packages *stats*,
[*quantreg*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=quantreg),
[*KernSmooth*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=KernSmooth).

## Main fitting function

The main estimation function `siqr` implements the iterative local
linear approach to the single-index quantile regression in
[@wu_single-index_2010].

The usage and input arguments of the main fitting function `siqr` are
summarized as follows:

``` r
  siqr(y, X, tau=0.5, h=NULL, beta.initial=NULL, se.method = NULL, maxiter=30, tol=1e-8)
```

This function takes two required arguments: the response variable y in
vector format, the covariate matrix X. Please note that all the input
covariates are required to be numeric variables.

This function also takes several optional arguments for finer controls.
The optional argument `tau` is the quantile index, which specifies the
left-tail probability. The default value of `tau` is 0.5, which refers
to a single-index median regression. The optional argument `h` is the
bandwidth in local linear quantile regression. Users can either provide
a bandwidth or let the algorithm decide the optimal bandwidth as
advocated in [@wu_single-index_2010] by setting this argument to NULL as
default. The optional argument `beta.initial` is a numeric vector of the
same length as the dimensionality of covariates. The users can use this
argument to pass in any appropriate user-defined initial single-index
coefficients based on prior information or domain knowledge. The default
value is NULL, which instructs the function to estimate the initial
single-index coefficients by linear quantile regression. The optional
argument `se.method` is a character variable that specifies the method
to obtain the standard error of estimated single-index coefficients. The
default value is NULL to skip the calculation of standard error while
the bootstrap-based method is available with \"bootstrap\". The optional
argument `maxiter` and `tol` are control parameters that specify the
criteria to terminate the iteration process. Although the algorithm
normally converges quickly, the default `maxiter` and `tol` are set to
30 and 1e-8, respectively.

## Other functions

We also provide several supporting functions:

``` r
  summary.siqr(siqr.object)
  print.summary.siqr(siqr.object)
```

The functions `summary.siqr` and `print.summary.siqr` provide detailed
information related to the fitted model and summarize the results as
illustrated in the next section. These two functions can be called
directly by applying functions print and summary to the siqr.object.

``` r
  plot.siqr(siqr.object, data.points = TRUE, bootstrap.interval=FALSE)
```

This function plots the fitted quantiles against the single-index term
from an SIQR-fitted model object. By default, this function will also
plot the observed data points in addition to the fitted quantiles to
visualize the fitness of the model. One can remove the data points by
setting the optional argument `data.points` to FALSE. Pointwise
confidence interval will be added to the plot if the optional argument
`bootstrap.interval` is set to TRUE.

``` r
  simulation_data <- generate.data(n, true.theta=NULL, sigma=0.1, 
  setting="setting1", ncopy=1)
```

To help perform simulation studies, the function `generate.data`
generates a size $n$ data from two different settings: (i) a sine-bump
model; and (ii) a location-scale model as in [@wu_single-index_2010].
Users can define the single-index coefficients $\boldsymbol{\beta}$ via
the argument `true.beta` and the noise level via `sigma`. If no
`true.beta` was provided, the function will use
$(1,1,1)^{\intercal} / \sqrt{3}$ for setting 1 and
$(1,2)^{\intercal} / \sqrt{5}$ for setting 2 as the default. The last
optional argument `ncopy` generates multiple copies of data for Monte
Carlo simulations.

# Real Data and Simulations

### Boston Housing data

We consider the Boston housing data to demonstrate the real data
application of the proposed R package *SIQR*. This dataset contains the
median value of houses (in \$1000's), medv, in 506 tracts in Boston and
13 other socio-demographic related variables. This data has been
investigated by many studies. Heterogeneity and some non-linear
dependence of medv on predictor variables have been found by previous
researchers. The dataset is maintained at the StatLib library of
Carnegie Mellon University and can be found at the R built-in package
*MASS*.

We focus on the following four covariates: RM, the average number of
rooms per dwelling; TAX, the full-value property tax (in \$) per
\$10,000; PTRATIO, the pupil-teacher ratio by town; and LSTAT,
percentage of the lower status of the population as in
[@opsomer_fully_1998], [@yu_local_2004], and [@wu_single-index_2010].
Following previous studies, we take logarithmic transformations on TAX
and LSTAT and center the dependent variable medv around zero.

We use the following codes to load data from *MASS* and pre-process as
discussed above. We fit a single-index quantile regression with
$\tau = 0.25,0.50,0.75$ to the data and report fitted single-index
coefficients for each variable.

``` r
  library(SIQR)
  #load data from MASS
  library(MASS)
  medv<- Boston$medv
  RM <- Boston$rm
  logTAX <- log(Boston$tax)
  PTRATIO <- Boston$ptratio
  logLSTAT <- log(Boston$lstat)

  X <- cbind(RM,logTAX,PTRATIO,logLSTAT)
  y0 <- medv - mean(medv)
  beta0 <- NULL
  tau.vec <- c(0.25,0.50,0.75)
  est.coefficient <- matrix(NA, nrow = length(tau.vec), ncol = 5)
  est.coefficient[,1] <- tau.vec
  for (i in 1:length(tau.vec)){
  est <- siqr(y0,X,beta.initial = beta0, tau=tau.vec[i],maxiter = 30,tol = 1e-8)
  est.coefficient[i,2:5] <- est$beta
  }
  colnames(est.coefficient) <- c("quantile tau",colnames(X))
  est.coefficient
```

``` r
 #>      quantile tau        RM     logTAX     PTRATIO   logLSTAT
 #> [1,]         0.25 0.3358285 -0.5243025 -0.06856117 -0.7795033
 #> [2,]         0.50 0.3129182 -0.4294159 -0.06640472 -0.8445558
 #> [3,]         0.75 0.2385613 -0.1933015 -0.07860687 -0.9484429
```

The estimated 0.25, 0.50, and 0.75 quantiles and their 95% pointwise
confidence bounds are plotted with the following codes and outputs.

``` r
  est.tau25 <- siqr(y0,X,beta.initial = NULL, tau=0.25)
  plot.siqr(est.tau25,bootstrap.interval = TRUE)
```

![Figure 1: The R output of `plot.siqr` with estimated 0.25 quantiles
and the 95% pointwise confidence
bounds.](siqr_files/figure-latex/unnamed-chunk-2-1.png){#fig:1
width="100%" alt="graphic without alt text"}

``` r
  est.tau50 <- siqr(y0,X,beta.initial = NULL, tau=0.50)
  plot.siqr(est.tau05,bootstrap.interval = TRUE)
```

![Figure 2: The R output of `plot.siqr` with estimated 0.50 quantiles
and the 95% pointwise confidence
bounds.](siqr_files/figure-latex/unnamed-chunk-3-1.png){#fig:2
width="100%" alt="graphic without alt text"}

``` r
  est.tau75 <- siqr(y0,X,beta.initial = NULL, tau=0.75)
  plot.siqr(est.tau75,bootstrap.interval = TRUE)
```

![Figure 3: The R output of `plot.siqr` with estimated 0.75 quantiles
and the 95% pointwise confidence
bounds.](siqr_files/figure-latex/unnamed-chunk-4-1.png){#fig:3
width="100%" alt="graphic without alt text"}

As the estimated single-index function curves are almost monotonically
increasing across different quantiles, variables that contribute
positively to the single index affect the response variable (medv)
positively. Based on the estimated coefficients and above plots, we
found that the number of rooms per house (rm) positively affects
different quantiles. This matches the intuition that people value large
spaces and multi-functional rooms. The property tax rate ln(tax) has a
negative impact on housing prices across different quantiles. However,
the influence of the tax rate is not significant at higher quantile
$\tau$ = 0.75. That suggests the tax rate may be less concerned for
higher-income households, possibly due to tax deduction towards their
income tax. Both the pupil-teacher ratio (ptratio) and the percentage of
the lower (educational) status of the population ln(lstat) show negative
influences on housing values, especially for the higher quantiles. It
may suggest that potential buyers prefer areas featuring solid
educational resources for their children and neighbors with higher
education degrees and that preference grows more vital for more
expensive houses.

### Simulation

We consider two simulation settings. In the first simulation example, we
use a sine-bump model with homoscedastic errors:
$$\label{eq:sim1}
	y=5 \sin \left(\frac{\pi \left( \textbf{ x}\mathbf{\beta}- A \right)}{C-A} \right)+ 0.1 Z,   (\#eq:sim1)$$
where
$A=\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}-\frac{1.645}{\sqrt{12}}, C=\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}+\frac{1.645}{\sqrt{12}}$,
$\textbf{ x}$ is an $n\times3$ design matrix that draws from an
independent uniform distribution with min of 0 and max of 1, and the
residual $Z$ follows a standard normal distribution. The true
single-index parameter $\mathbf{\beta}= (1,1,1)^{\intercal} / \sqrt{3}$.

:::

The single-index coefficients are estimated via a series of quantile
regressions with $\tau = 0.25, 0.50, 0.75.$ TableÂ [1](#tb:sim1) reports
the mean, standard error (s.e.), and bias for each parameter estimate
with sample size $n=400$ over $M=200$ replications on the simulation
example 1. One can see that the algorithm for our R package *SIQR* is
effective as the estimates are close to the true values.

For demonstration purposes, we show codes to generate data from
(\@ref(eq:sim1)) and fit the SIQR model using $\tau = 0.50$ with 200
replications as follows:

``` r
 n <- 400
 beta0 <- c(1, 1, 1)/sqrt(3)
 n.sim <- 200
 tau <- 0.50
 data <- generate.data(n, true.theta=beta0, setting = "setting1",ncopy = n.sim)
 sim.results.50 <- foreach(m = 1:n.sim,.combine = "rbind") %do% {
 X <- data$X
 Y <- data$Y[[m]]
 est <- siqr(Y, X, beta.initial = c(2,1,0), tau=0.50,maxiter = 30,tol = 1e-8)
 return(est$beta)
}
```

Note that this process has been repeated for the cases with
$\tau = 0.25, 0.75$. We obtain a box plot of estimated single-index
coefficients for $\tau = 0.25, 0.50, 0.75$, respectively, by applying
the following code snippet.

``` r
 boxplot(data.frame((sim.results.25)), outline=T,notch=T,range=1,
 main = "Boxplots of Coefficient Estimates, tau = 0.25",horizontal = F)
```

``` r
 boxplot(data.frame((sim.results.75)), outline=T,notch=T,range=1,
 main = "Boxplots of Coefficient Estimates, tau = 0.75",horizontal = F)
```

$\tau = 0.75$ from example

Next, we consider a location-scale model as simulation example 2, where
both the location and the scale depend on a common index
$u=\textbf{ x}\mathbf{\beta}$. The quantiles are
"almost-linear-in-index\" as in [@yu_local_1998] when the single index u
is close to zero:
$$\label{eq:sim2}
  y=5 \cos (\textbf{ x}\mathbf{\beta})+ \exp(-(\textbf{ x}\mathbf{\beta})^2) + E,   (\#eq:sim2)$$
where $\textbf{ x}$ is an $n\times2$ design matrix that draws from an
independent normal distribution with a standard deviation of 0.25, and
the residual $E$ follows an exponential distribution with a mean 2. The
single-index parameter $\mathbf{\beta}= (1,2)^{\intercal} / \sqrt{5}$.

The simulated data are generated with the following codes. The sample
size $n = 400$ with 100 replications. We only present the case when
$\tau = 0.50$ for demonstration purposes.

``` r
  n <- 400
  beta0 <- c(1, 2)/sqrt(5)
  n.sim <- 100
  tau <- 0.5
  data <- generate.data(n, true.theta=beta0, setting = "setting3",ncopy = n.sim)
  sim.results <- foreach(m = 1:n.sim,.combine = "rbind") %do% {
  X <- data$X
  Y <- data$Y[[m]]
  est <- siqr(Y, X, beta.initial = NULL, tau=tau,maxiter = 30,tol = 1e-8)
  est$beta
  }
  est.mean <- c(tau,apply(sim.results,2,mean))
  names(est.mean) <- c("tau","beta1.hat","beta2.hat")
  est.mean
```

``` r
  est.mean <- cbind(p_vec,apply(sim_results,c(1,2),sd))
  colnames(est.mean) <- c("quantile tau","X1","X2","X3")
  est.mean
```

``` r
  #> tau beta1.hat beta2.hat 
  #> 0.5 0.4515909 0.8917233
```

The average estimated single-index coefficients shown above are close to
the true single-index parameter
$\mathbf{\beta}= (1,2)^{\intercal} / \sqrt{5} \approx(0.4472,0.8944)$.
On top of that, the simulation standard error is also reported as below:

``` r
  est.se <- c(tau,apply(sim.results,2,sd))
  names(est.se) <- c("tau","beta1.se.hat","beta1.se.hat")
  est.se
```

``` r
  #>   tau beta1.se.hat beta1.se.hat 
  #>   0.5   0.02682211   0.01359602
```

Meanwhile, the following box plots show that the estimated single-index
coefficients are close to the true parameters with small deviations.

``` r
  boxplot(data.frame((sim.results)), outline=T,notch=T,range=1,
  main = "Boxplots of Coefficient Estimates (100 replications)",horizontal = F)
```

$\tau = 0.50$ from example

Similarly, we plot the estimated quantiles and their 95% pointwise
confidence bounds with the provided plot function `plot.siqr`. The
observed data points are also plotted.

``` r
  est.sim.50 <- siqr(data$Y[[1]],data$X,beta.initial = NULL, tau=0.5)
  plot.siqr(est.sim.50,bootstrap.interval = TRUE)
```

# Summary

In this paper, we present the R package *SIQR* for the local linear
approach to single-index quantile regression models in
[@wu_single-index_2010]. We demonstrate the package applications to a
popular Boston-housing data application and two simulation studies. It
is our hope that the package will be useful to a variety of
applications, especially for complex heterogeneous data where flexible
quantile regression modeling is desirable.
