title: 'SIQR: An R Package for Single-index Quantile Regression'
abstract: We develop an R package SIQR that implements the single-index quantile regression
  (SIQR) models via an efficient iterative local linear approach in Wu et al. (2010).
  Single-index quantile regression models are important tools in semiparametric regression
  to provide a comprehensive view of the conditional distributions of a response variable.
  It is especially useful when the data is heterogeneous or heavy-tailed. The package
  provides functions that allow users to fit SIQR models, predict, provide standard
  errors of the single-index coefficients via bootstrap, and visualize the estimated
  univariate function. We apply the R package SIQR to a well-known Boston Housing
  data.
