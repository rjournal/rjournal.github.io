title: 'metapack: An R Package for Bayesian Meta-Analysis and Network Meta-Analysis
  with a Unified Formula Interface'
abstract: Meta-analysis, a statistical procedure that compares, combines, and synthesizes
  research findings from multiple studies in a principled manner, has become popular
  in a variety of fields. Meta-analyses using study-level (or equivalently *aggregate*)
  data are of particular interest due to data availability and modeling flexibility.
  In this paper, we describe an R package metapack that introduces a unified formula
  interface for both meta-analysis and network meta-analysis. The user interface---and
  therefore the package---allows flexible variance-covariance modeling for multivariate
  meta-analysis models and univariate network meta-analysis models. Complicated computing
  for these models has prevented their widespread adoption. The package also provides
  functions to generate relevant plots and perform statistical inferences like model
  assessments. Use cases are demonstrated using two real data sets contained in metapack.
