title: 'fclust: An R Package for Fuzzy Clustering'
abstract: Fuzzy clustering methods discover fuzzy partitions where observations can
  be softly assigned to more than one cluster. The package fclust is a toolbox for
  fuzzy clustering in the R programming language. It not only implements the widely
  used fuzzy k-means (FkM) algorithm, but also many FkM variants. Fuzzy cluster similarity
  measures, cluster validity indices and cluster visualization tools are also offered.
  In the current version, all the functions are rewritten in the C++ language allowing
  their application in large-size problems. Moreover, new fuzzy relational clustering
  algorithms for partitioning qualitative/mixed data are provided together with an
  improved version of the so-called Gustafson-Kessel algorithm to avoid singularity
  in the cluster covariance matrices. Finally, it is now possible to automatically
  select the number of clusters by means of the available fuzzy cluster validity indices.
