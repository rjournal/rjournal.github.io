title: Resampling-Based Analysis of Multivariate Data and Repeated Measures Designs
  with the R Package MANOVA.RM
abstract: Nonparametric statistical inference methods for a modern and robust analysis
  of longitudinal and multivariate data in factorial experiments are essential for
  research. While existing approaches that rely on specific distributional assumptions
  of the data (multivariate normality and/or equal covariance matrices) are implemented
  in statistical software packages, there is a need for user-friendly software that
  can be used for the analysis of data that do not fulfill the aforementioned assumptions
  and provide accurate p value and confidence interval estimates. Therefore, newly
  developed nonpara metric statistical methods based on bootstrapand permutation-approaches,
  which neither assume multivariate normality nor specific covariance matrices, have
  been implemented in the freely available R package MANOVA.RM. The package is equipped
  with a graphical user interface for plausible applications in academia and other
  educational purpose. Several motivating examples illustrate the application of the
  methods.
