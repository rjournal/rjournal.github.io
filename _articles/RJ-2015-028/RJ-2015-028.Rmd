title: 'PracTools: Computations for Design of Finite Population Samples'
abstract: PracTools is an R package with functions that compute sample sizes for various
  types of finite population sampling designs when totals or means are estimated.
  One-, two-, and three-stage designs are covered as well as allocations for stratified
  sampling and probability proportional to size sampling. Sample allocations can be
  computed that minimize the variance of an estimator subject to a budget constraint
  or that minimize cost subject to a precision constraint. The package also contains
  some specialized functions for estimating variance components and design effects.
  Several finite populations are included that are useful for classroom instruction.
