# Introduction

## Melting Curve Analysis

Nucleic acid *Melting Curve Analysis* (MCA) is a central step in nucleic
acid[^1] interaction studies, identification of specific DNA sequences
after quantitative real-time PCR, genotyping or detection of *Single
Nucleotide Polymorphisms*[^2] (SNP) both in solution and on surfaces
[@Ririe1997; @Gundry2003; @Sekar2005; @Zhou2005; @Roediger2012a]. A
review of the literature revealed that there is an ongoing demand for
new bioanalytical devices to perform MCAs. This includes lab-on-chip
systems or the recently published *VideoScan* platform [@Roediger2012a
see following section]. Some of these systems offer software solutions
for MCA but often custom made software is required. Although
bioanalytical devices break new ground to meet criteria like high
multiplex levels or new detection-probe-systems the fundamental concept
of MCA remains unchanged.

The MCA is a real-time monitoring of a heat-induced double stranded
nucleic acid dissociation which can be monitored by the change of the
referenced mean/median fluorescence intensity ($MFI$)[^3] at a defined
temperature (Figure [1](#figure:TM_theory)).

![Figure 1: []{#figure:TM_theory label="figure:TM_theory"} Melting curve
and melting peaks of double stranded DNA. Raw data curves
($refMFI(T)$ [**╍╍╍**]{style="color: red"}), approximate first
derivative ($refMFI`(T)$ [**╍╍╍**]{style="color: green"}) and second
derivative ($refMFI``(T)$ [╍╍╍]{style="color: blue"}). Peak values: $Tm$
is the maximum of the first derivative. $Tm_{1}^{D2}$ and $Tm_{2}^{D2}$
are the extremes (a minimum and a maximum) of the second derivative.

DNA.](figures/TM_theory.png){#figure:TM_theory width="100%" alt="graphic without alt text"}

By definition, the *melting point* ($Tm$) is the inflection point of the
melting curve. On molecular level circa 50% of the nucleic acids are
dissociated at $Tm$. The *melting peak* (Equation \@ref(eq:derivative))
can be determined from the first negative derivative
(Equation \@ref(eq:deriv1)) of the melting curve. At this temperature
peak the rate of change is maximal. The $Tm$ is highly reproducible,
thus can be used as a "characteristic identity" to distinguish nucleic
acid species.

$$\begin{aligned}
Tm &= \max(refMFI'(T))\\ 
\label{eq:derivative}
\end{aligned}   (\#eq:derivative)$$

$$\begin{aligned}
refMFI'(T) &= -\frac{d(refMFI)}{d(T)} 
\label{eq:deriv1}
\end{aligned}   (\#eq:deriv1)$$

To the best of our knowledge we are the first to suggest the peak
values, designated $Tm_{1}^{D2}$ and $Tm_{2}^{D2}$
(Equation \@ref(eq:derivative2max) and \@ref(eq:derivative2min)), of the
second derivative (Equation \@ref(eq:deriv2)) as additional measures for
the characterization of nucleic acid melting processes on microbead
surfaces. They show the maximal rate of change of $refMFI`(T)$. The
corresponding temperature values (abscissa) at the inflection points of
$refMFI`(T)$ occur where $refMFI``(T)$ reaches a (local) minimum and a
(local) maximum, respectively (Figure [1](#figure:TM_theory)). Both
values offer additional quantitative measures to describe early and late
phases of the melting process. The $Tm_{1}^{D2}$ quantifies the maximal
acceleration and $Tm_{2}^{D2}$ the maximal deceleration of the
dissociation process. The deceleration starts in the middle of the
process, at $Tm$.

$$\begin{aligned}
Tm_{1}^{D2} &= \max(refMFI``(T))\\ 
\label{eq:derivative2max}
\end{aligned}   (\#eq:derivative2max)$$

$$\begin{aligned}
Tm_{2}^{D2} &= \min(refMFI``(T))\\  
\label{eq:derivative2min}
\end{aligned}   (\#eq:derivative2min)$$

$$\begin{aligned}
refMFI``(T) &= -\frac{d^2(refMFI)}{d(T)^2}  
\label{eq:deriv2}
\end{aligned}   (\#eq:deriv2)$$

## Surface Melting Curve Analysis {#sec:surface_MCA}

In @Roediger2012a we reported the *VideoScan* platform which provides a
technology for various bioanalytical applications[^4] with the focus on
highly multiplex kinetic analysis. The *VideoScan* platform consists of
a fully automated fluorescence microscope, a modular software package
for data acquisition and a heating/cooling-unit (HCU)[^5] for micro
volume ($\leq{20~\mu\/L}$) samples. We developed temperature controlled
assays to detect and analyze nucleic acid probes on the surface of
microbeads.

In brief, different thermo-tolerant microbead populations, defined by
varying ratios of two impregnated fluorophores, are included in the
reaction. Each microbead population presents gene specific capture
probes on their surfaces (Figure [2](#figure:probe_systems)).

![Figure 2: []{#figure:probe_systems label="figure:probe_systems"}
Principles of microbead *direct hybridization* probe systems. A) The
*FRET assay* uses microbead bound capture probe (*bCP*) with the
fluorophore- (\*) and quencher-labeled (**Q**) detection probes (*DP*).
A *bCP* consists of different regions (e. g., *bCP$_{1}$*, *bCP$_{2}$*)
ready to hybridize with a complementary *DP*. B) The *standard assay*
uses non-labeled *bCP*s which hybridize with fluorophore-labeled *DP*s.
Inset) Both probe systems differ in the curve shape resulting from the
melting process.](figures/probe_systems.png){#figure:probe_systems
width="100%" alt="graphic without alt text"}

Particularly, short 3' or 5' quencher/fluorophore-labeled probes were
used[^6]. The capture probes (*bCP*) are complementary to detection
probe (*DP*) in solution (Figure [2](#figure:probe_systems) and inset
Figure [13](#figure:Mutation_melt_fig19)). Signals are mediated by
temperature dependent dehybridization events between *bCP*s and *DP*s.
All probe systems described here and our related works are characterized
by one or two significant melting peaks at different temperatures and/or
different signs (Figure [3](#figure:melt)). Due to different fluorophore
/ quencher combinations and probe systems (e. g., direct hybridization,
dual-hybridization probes) the sign of a $Tm$ peak value was designed to
be either positive or negative (see Figure [3](#figure:melt)B).
Transferred to applications in screening processes all subsequent
analysis would be reduced to the identification of distinct $Tm$s and
their intensity of the corresponding microbead populations.

for *$Poly(dA)_{20}$* ( °C) followed by a second (negative) peak of
*$aCS$* ( °C).](figures/fig_1.png){#figure:melt width="100%" alt="graphic without alt text"}

## Why use R for Melting Curve Analysis?

In biomedical research many scientists rely on closed source software
which gives only little control over the computation and data
presentation. Most importantly reproduction of data and calculations
from other research is limited or impossible. Just recently this was
discussed in the two journals *Nature* and *Science*
[@Ince2012; @Morin2012]. Closed software tied to limited tasks, hinders
the import of custom data and gives no control over or insight into the
source code and therefore is not ideal for research. Basically any open
computing language or tool can be used to overcome these issues. But R
fulfills all requirements mentioned above. It is in an open system with
numerous utilities for data import, processing, sophisticated
statistical analysis and presentation. Many R packages are peer-reviewed
and undergo an intensive testing. Most importantly R is open source and
therefore methods or results can be reproduced independently.

One implementation for MCA with R is available from the excellent
[*qpcR*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=qpcR) package by @Ritz2008.
The `meltcurve()` function provides a sophisticated method to process
melting curve data from qPCR experiments in solution. It uses automatic
optimization procedures to smooth and fit curves. This function is ideal
for the identification of multiple $Tm$s, the calculation of the peak
area and high resolution data.

# Motivation for the *MBmca* package

There is an ongoing interest to understand the melting behavior of
nucleic acids on surfaces. Particularly the effects of the reaction
environment, e. g., the microbead surface change due to functional
groups or the density of *bCP* has not been investigated intensively for
multiplex microbead assays. During the development of the *VideoScan*
platform a simple and lightweight method for automatic screening,
quality control and automatic detection of a limited number of melting
peaks was needed. This article describes the
[*MBmca*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=MBmca)[^7] [@Roediger2013]
package which was developed as an approach for statistical MCA on
microbeads. The ambition of the *MBmca* is not to compete with the
*qpcR* or other R packages but rather to extend the scope of R for MCA
on surfaces.

# Implementation of MCA in the *MBmca* package

## Functions and data sets of *MBmca*

The *MBmca* package includes the functions `MFIerror()`,
`mcaPeaks()`[^8] and `mcaSmoother()` for data inspection and
preprocessing and `diffQ()`, `diffQ2()` for MCA. The data sets
`DualHyb`, `DMP` and `MultiMelt` are raw fluorescence data measured with
the *VideoScan* platform [@Roediger2012a] on microbead surfaces. The
data are arranged as `data.frame`s starting in the first column with the
temperature (°C) followed by the fluorescence values (refMFI). The
package has a dependency to
[*robustbase*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=robustbase)
[@Rousseeuw2013] and uses mainly standard R functions. Elementary steps,
e. g., data import, are similar to other R functions and thus used as
described elsewhere [@R2013].

## Inspection of raw fluorescence data

One of the fundamental strengths of the MCA on microbead surfaces is the
achievable multiplex level. The `MFIerror()` function was developed for
a fast multiple comparison of the temperature dependent variance of
$refMFI$. `MFIerror()` returns an object of the class `data.frame` with
columns "Temperature", "Location" (Mean, Median), "Deviation" (Standard
Deviation, Median Absolute Deviation) and "Coefficient of Variation".

-   The argument `errplot` (default) sets `MFIerror()` to plot the
    results. In the default setting (`CV = FALSE`) the mean with the
    standard deviations is plotted. Using the argument `rob = TRUE` the
    median and the median absolute deviation (MAD) are plotted instead
    of the mean and standard deviation.

-   If `CV` is true the coefficient of variation (CV) is plotted.
    Setting the argument `RSD = TRUE` shows the relative standard
    deviation (RSD) in percent.

In an example the mean raw fluorescence from multiplex melting curves of
twelve microbead populations was evaluated for the probes *HPRT1* and
*$MLC{-2v}$* (`MultiMelt` data set). The probe system used corresponds
to Figure [2](#figure:probe_systems)A. Ideally the variance between the
twelve microbead populations is low. `MFIerror()` takes the first column
of `MultiMelt` as temperature value and columns 2 to 13 for the probes
*HPRT1* and columns 14 to 25 for *$MLC{-2v}$*, respectively.

``` r
# Load MultiMelt data set.
data(MultiMelt)

# MFIerror for the HRPT1 data (column 2 to 13).
# The default settings of MFIerror show the the mean fluorescence and the 
# standard deviation at a defined temperature.
MFIerror(MultiMelt[, 1], MultiMelt[, 2:13])

# MFIerror on the MLC-2v data (column 14 to 25).
MFIerror(MultiMelt[, 1], MultiMelt[, 14:25])
```

The corresponding plots are shown in Figure [4](#figure:error_mean). The
curves indicate that the different microbead populations show similar
melting curve shapes but differ in height. At higher temperatures the
values vary.

![Figure 4: []{#figure:error_mean label="figure:error_mean"} Inspection
of the mean raw fluorescence from multiplex melting curves. `MFIerror()`
with the argument `rob = FALSE` was used to compare the mean and the
standard deviationof the temperature dependent fluorescence on twelve
microbead populations for A) *HPRT1* and B)
*$MLC{-2v}$*.](figures/error_mean.png){#figure:error_mean width="100%" alt="graphic without alt text"}

When `MFIerror()` is used with the argument `CV = TRUE` the coefficient
of variation is presented (Figure [5](#figure:error_cv)). In the example
all CV values are low ($< 0.3$) and even decrease with increasing
temperatures for both *HPRT1* and *$MLC{-2v}$*.

![Figure 5: []{#figure:error_cv label="figure:error_cv"} Comparison of
the absolute coefficient of variation from multiplex melting curves.
`MFIerror()` with argument `CV = TRUE` was used to plot the absolute
coefficient of variation for twelve microbead populations with A)
*HPRT1* or B) *$MLC{-2v}$*.](figures/error_cv.png){#figure:error_cv
width="100%" alt="graphic without alt text"}

We questioned how a single microbead population differs from the average
of all microbead populations. The mean output of `MFIerror()`, with the
argument `errplot = FALSE`, was subtracted by the fluorescence of
*HPRT1* or *$MLC{-2v}$*. The results were assigned to `HPRT1.mean` and
`MLC2v.mean`.

``` r
# Load MultiMelt data set.
data(MultiMelt)

# Use MFIerror to calculate the mean fluorescence for HRPT1 and MLC-2v over all 
# twelve microbead populations.
HPRT1.mean <- MFIerror(MultiMelt[, 1], MultiMelt[, 2:13], errplot = FALSE)
MLC2v.mean <- MFIerror(MultiMelt[, 1], MultiMelt[, 14:25], errplot = FALSE)

# Draw figures on the graphics device in a 2x6 array
par(mfrow = c(2, 6))

# Calculate the difference between the fluorescence of a single microbead population 
# and the average of all twelve microbead populations. Plot the results.
for (i in 1:12) {
  tmp.HPRT1 <- MultiMelt[, i + 1] - HPRT1.mean[, 2]
  tmp.MLC2v <- MultiMelt[, i + 13] - MLC2v.mean[, 2]
  plot(MultiMelt[, 1], tmp.HPRT1, main = paste("Pop", i, sep = ": "), 
       pch = 19, ylim = c(-0.28, 0.28), xlab = "T", ylab = "delta")
  abline(h = 0, col = "black")
  abline(v = 65, col = "blue")
  points(MultiMelt[, 1], tmp.MLC2v, pch = 15, col = 2)
}
```

Figure [6](#figure:delta) shows low differences (delta) at temperatures
below 65 °C due to near complete quenching. Above this temperature
(start of the DNA probe strand dissociation) the differences to the mean
fluorescence of all microbead populations grow. Apart from "Pop: 1"
changes appear systematically which indicates that the *bCP*/*DP*s have
a similar melting behavior on all microbead populations.

## Preprocessing of raw fluorescence data

The differentiation is the central step of the MCA. Accessible textbook
information confirms that differentiation may result in the
amplification of noise. To reduce the noise, R provides numerous
possibilities to fit smooth functions and use filter functions. Such
operations may alter the curve shape considerably and thus lead to
artificial results. Smooth functions available in R include the moving
average (`filter()`,
[*stats*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=stats)), the LOWESS
smoother (`lowess()`, *stats*) which applies locally-weighted polynomial
regression, fitting of a local polynomial regression (`loess()`,
*stats*), Savitsky-Golay filter [`sgolayfilt()`,
[*signal*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=signal); @signal], cubic
splines (`smooth.spline()`, *stats*) or Friedman's SuperSmoother
(`supsmu()`, *stats*). Although smoothed data might provide the
impression of high quality data no guarantee for optimal results or that
no peaks were artificially introduced is given. A good practice is to
visualize the output combined with the original data. `mcaSmoother()`
uses `smooth.spline()` and contains further helper function.
`mcaSmoother()` should be used if the data may contain missing values,
high noise or if the temperature resolution of the melting curve data is
low ($\geq$ 0.5 °C / step) in order to correct the problems
automatically.

-   Measurements from experimental systems may occasionally include
    missing values (`NA`). Function `mcaSmoother()` uses `approx()`[^9]
    to fill up `NA`s under the assumption that all measurements were
    equidistant. The original data remain unchanged and only the `NA`s
    are substituted.

-   `mcaSmoother()` calls `smooth.spline()` to smooth the curve.
    Different strengths can be set using the argument `df.fact`
    (default 0.95). Internally it takes the degree of freedom value from
    the spline and multiplies it with a factor between 0.6 and 1.1.
    Values lower than 1 result in more strongly smoothed curves.

-   If the argument `bgadj` is set `TRUE`, `bg` must be used to define a
    temperature range for a linear background correction[^10]. The
    linear trend is estimated by a robust linear regression using
    `lmrob()`. In case criteria for a robust linear regression are
    violated `lm()` is used automatically.

-   The argument `Trange` can be used to define a temperature range of
    the analysis.

-   To scale the fluorescence a *Min-Max normalization*
    (Equation \@ref(eq:normalization1)) between 0 and 1 can be used by
    setting the argument `minmax` to `TRUE`. This is useful if the
    fluorescence values between samples vary considerably, for example
    due to high background. An advantage of this normalization is the
    preservation of the relationships between the values. However, on
    surfaces normalization should be used with caution because it might
    lead to the false impression that all microbeads carried equal
    quantities of *bCP*.

-   The argument `n` uses the `spline()` function to increase the
    temperature resolution of the melting curve data by $n$-times the
    length of the input temperature (see `mcaSmoother()` examples in
    @Roediger2013).

$$refMFInorm = \frac{refMFI - \min(refMFI)}{\max(refMFI) - \min(refMFI)}  
\label{eq:normalization1}   (\#eq:normalization1)$$

`mcaSmoother()` returns an object of the class "`data.frame`" with the
columns "x" (temperature) and "y" (fluorescence values). These can be
used to plot the preprocessed data. For example, three arbitrary chosen
strengths to smooth the curves ($f$: 0.6, 0.8, 1.0) were tested. Data
from the `DMP` data set were used as follows:

``` r
# Load DMP data set.
data(DMP)

# Create plot with raw data.
plot(DMP[, 1], DMP[, 6], xlim = c(20, 95), xlab = "T [C]", 
     ylab = "refMFI", pch = 19, col = 8)

# Add minor tick marks to the abscissa.
require(Hmisc); minor.tick(nx = 20)
```

The function `mcaSmoother()` is used in a loop to smooth the curve with
user defined strengths ($f$). Wrapped into `lines()` it draws[^11] the
corresponding curves directly (Figure [7](#figure:smooth)). In
comparison to the original data a low filter strength ($f$: 1) is
sufficient.

``` r
# Define three filter strengths (highest (0.6) to lowest (1.0)) and assign them 
# to df.fact. Smooth the raw data and add the results as lines to the plot.
f <- c(0.6, 0.8, 1.0)
for (i in 1:3) { 
  lines(mcaSmoother(DMP[, 1], DMP[, 6], df.fact = f[i]), col = i, lwd = 2)
}
# Add a legend to the plot with the filter strengths.
legend(20, 1.5, paste("f", f, sep = ": "), cex = 1.2, col =  1:3, 
       bty = "n", lty = 1, lwd = 4)
```

![Figure 7: []{#figure:smooth label="figure:smooth"} Raw fluorescence

`mcaSmoother()` with different strengths ($f$) to smooth the
curves.](figures/Fig_mcaSmoother.png){#figure:smooth width="100%" alt="graphic without alt text"}

In the next example `mcaSmoother()` was used with different arguments to
(i) smooth the data, (ii) remove the background and (iii) to perform a
Min-Max normalization. Data for *HPRT1* (Figure [8](#figure:multi)A)
were taken from the `MultiMelt` data set. The plot of
Figure [8](#figure:multi)B implies that it is sustainable to smooth the
curve. Not immediately obvious, the twelve microbead populations have
different final signal intensities. This is due to the different
quantities of surface bound *bCP*s (not shown). However, this is easily
visualized after a background correction (Figure [8](#figure:multi)C).
All curves appear similar in shape after the Min-Max normalization. This
indicates that there are no substantial differences between the
microbead populations which obfuscates further MCAs
(Figure [8](#figure:multi)D).

## Calculation of the melting peaks

The functions `diffQ()` and `diffQ2()` are used to calculate $Tm$,
$Tm_{1}^{D2}$ and $Tm_{2}^{D2}$ (Figure [1](#figure:TM_theory)) and to
perform simple graphical operations (e. g., show derivatives).
Basically, both functions do not require smoothed data[^12] for the MCA.
However, it is recommended to use `mcaSmoother()` as a starter function
to preprocess (e.g., moderate smoothing, missing value removal, type
check) the data automatically. First the approximate $Tm$, $Tm_{1}^{D2}$
and $Tm_{2}^{D2}$ are determined as the `min()` and/or `max()` from the
derivatives[^13] according to Equation \@ref(eq:derivative),
\@ref(eq:derivative2max) and \@ref(eq:derivative2min). This approximate
peak value is the starting-point for an accurate calculation. The
function takes a defined number $n$ (maximum 8) of the left and the
right neighbor values and fits a quadratic polynomial[^14]. The
quadratic regression `lm(Y  ̃X I(X^2))` of the $X$ (temperature) against
the $Y$ (fluorescence) range gives the coefficients. The optimal
quadratic polynomial is chosen based on the highest adjusted R-squared
value ($R_{adj.}^2$). In the example of Figure [10](#figure:multi_melt)
two left and right neighbors were required. The coefficients are used to
calculate the root of the quadratic polynomial and thus to determine
$Tm$, $Tm_{1}^{D2}$ and $Tm_{2}^{D2}$. An estimate of a $Tm$ does not
neccesarily reflect a valid result. Therefore, several routines were
implemented in `diffQ()` and `diffQ2()` which try to catch cases where
an experiment went wrong. This includes a test if the data originate
from noise, a test which analyses the difference between the approximate
$Tm$ and the calculated $Tm$, and a tests for the goodness of fit value
($R_{adj.}^2$, Normalized-Root-Mean-Squared-Error (NRMSE)) of the
quadratic polynomial. The functions will give a warning message and
point to the potential error[^15]. A good practice is to visualize the
output and to control the peak heights (Example in Section "Multiplex
analysis of dual melting peaks"). A bimodal probe system (compare
Figure [3](#figure:melt)B) requires the separation of the analysis. The
minimum and maximum of the approximate first derivative have to be
determined independently. Although `diffQ()` is a major function it has
only a simple plot function. By setting the argument `plot = TRUE` plots
for single melting curves can be investigated
(Figure [9](#figure:diffQ_plot)). `diffQ()` accepts further following
arguments:

-   `fct` accepts `min` or `max` as argument and is used to define
    whether to find a local minimum ("negative peak") or local maximum
    ("positive peak").

-   `fws` defines the number ($n$) of left and right neighbors to use
    for the calculation of the quadratic polynomial.

-   `plot` defines if a single plot of the melting peak should be
    created. If `FALSE` (default) no plot is created.

-   `negderiv` is used to change the sign of the derivatives. If `TRUE`
    (default) then the first negative derivative is calculated. This
    argument was implemented to compare different quencher / fluorophore
    combinations (compare Figure [2](#figure:probe_systems)).

-   Functions for a graphical output include `peak` to show the peak
    values and `deriv` to show the first derivative with the color
    assigned to `col`. `derivlimits` and `derivlimitsline` show the
    number of neighbors ($n$) or the region used to calculate the $Tm$.
    `vertiline` draws a vertical line at the $Tm$s
    (Figure [10](#figure:multi_melt)).

``` r
# Load MultiMelt data set.
data(MultiMelt)

# Draw figures on the graphics device in two columns.
par(mfrow = c(1, 2))

# Use mcaSmoother to check and smooth the raw data for HRPT1 (2) and MLC-2v (14) 
# with the default setting.
# Plot the first derivative of the two samples.

`diffQ()` shows no melting peak plot. `diffQ()`, with the argument
`plot = TRUE`, can be used to show the melting peak (red dot) and fitted

For sophisticated analysis and plots it is recommended to use `diffQ()`
as part of the procedure. The arguments (e.g., `peak`, `deriv`) can be
used when a plot already exists. `diffQ2()` calls instances of `diffQ()`
to calculate $Tm_{1}^{D2}$ and $Tm_{2}^{D2}$. The arguments are similar
to `diffQ()`. Both `diffQ()` and `diffQ2()` return objects of the class
`list`. Accessing components of lists is done as described elsewhere
[@R2013; @Roediger2013] either by name or by number.

# Practical applications

## Multiplex analysis of single melting peaks

`diffQ2()` was used to investigate effects of the surface capture probe
density which is represented by the maximal $refMFI$ value. The $Tm$,
$Tm_{1}^{D2}$ and $Tm_{2}^{D2}$ values were determined simultaneously on
12 microbead populations (12-plex) either for *HPRT1* (compare
Figure [8](#figure:multi)) or *$MLC{-2v}$* using data from `MultiMelt`.
In the following *HPRT1* was used as example. The corresponding matrix
was called `HPRT1`[^16].

``` r
# Load MultiMelt data set.
data(MultiMelt)

# Create an empty matrix ("HRPT1") for the diffQ2 results (e.g., Tm).
HPRT1 <- matrix(NA, 12, 4, dimnames = list(colnames(MultiMelt[, 2:13]),
                c("Fluo", "Tm", "Tm1D2", "Tm2D2")))

# Use mcaSmoother to check and smooth the raw data. Apply diffQ2 to the smoothed data, 
# calculate the values for the extreme (minimum) and assign the results to "HRPT1".
for (i in 2:13) {
  tmp <- mcaSmoother(MultiMelt[, 1], MultiMelt[, i])
  tmpTM <- diffQ2(tmp, fct = min, verbose = TRUE)
  HPRT1[i-1, 1] <- max(tmp[["y.sp"]])
  HPRT1[i-1, 2] <- as.numeric(tmpTM[["TmD1"]][["Tm"]]) # Tm
  HPRT1[i-1, 3] <- as.numeric(tmpTM[["xTm1.2.D2"]][1]) # Tm1D2
  HPRT1[i-1, 4] <- as.numeric(tmpTM[["xTm1.2.D2"]][2]) # Tm2D2
}
```

The surface capture density was determined by `max(tmp[["y.sp"]])`.
Subsequently the data from the matrices `HPRT1` and `MLC2v` were plotted
(Figure [11](#figure:refMFI_TM_MLC2v_HPRT1)).

``` r
# Plot the Tm, Tm1D2 and Tm2D2 form the matrix "HRPT1" versus the surface capture 
# probe density ("Fluo").
plot(HPRT1[, 1], HPRT1[, 2], xlab = "refMFI", ylab = "T [C]", main = "HPRT1", 
     xlim = c(2.1, 2.55), ylim = c(72, 82), pch = 19, col = 1:12, cex = 1.8)
       
# Add minor tick marks to the abscissa.
require(Hmisc); minor.tick(ny = 10)
points(HPRT1[, 1], HPRT1[, 3], pch = 15)
points(HPRT1[, 1], HPRT1[, 4], pch = 15)

# Add trend lines (lm()) for the peak values.
abline(lm(HPRT1[, 2] ~ HPRT1[, 1])) # Tm
abline(lm(HPRT1[, 3] ~ HPRT1[, 1])) # Tm1D2
abline(lm(HPRT1[, 4] ~ HPRT1[, 1])) # Tm2D2
```

The melting temperature of *$MLC{-2v}$* was 76.08 °C and 77.85 °C for
*HPRT1* on all microbead populations (Table [1](#table:tab_2)). This
indicates that the surface capture probe density did not decrease or
increase the $Tm$ within the given range. $Tm_{1}^{D2}$ and
$Tm_{2}^{D2}$ showed a symmetrical pattern with a low variance and
therefore support that the start and end of the melting process are
similar between the microbead populations. We suggest that the later
peak values can be used as an additional means to describe the melting
process in more detail.

## Multiplex analysis of dual melting peaks {#sec:Multiplex_Analysis_of_Dual_Melting_Peaks}

The *bCP*s were hybridized with *DP*s (compare Figure [3](#figure:melt))
in order to generate bimodal melting peak patterns[^17]. Due to the base
composition $Poly(dA)_{20}$ *DP*s were expected to melt at lower
temperatures than the *DP*s *aCS* and *$MLC{-2v}$*. First the
temperature and selected probes fluorescence values from the `DMP` data
set were arranged in the data frame `data.tmp` and an empty plot was
created.

``` r
# Load DMP data set.
data(DMP)

# Use the temperature (column 1) and fluorescence (column 3, 5, 6), assign them to 
# a temporary data frame and add the sample names.
data.tmp <- data.frame(DMP[, 1], DMP[, 3], DMP[, 5], DMP[, 6])
names(data.tmp) <- c("T [C]", "Poly(dA)20 & MLC-2v",
		     "Poly(dA)20 & aCS", "Poly(dA)20")
                    
# Create a plot with the selected raw data.
plot(NA, NA, xlim = c(20, 95), ylim = c(-0.6, 0.6), xlab = "T [C]", 
     ylab = "-d(refMFI) / d(T)", main = "", pch = 19, col = 1:12, cex = 1.8)

# Add minor tick marks to the abscissa.
require(Hmisc); minor.tick(nx = 10)
```

Thereafter, the data were preprocessed with `mcaSmoother()` in a loop.
The arguments `bg = c(20, 35)` and `bgadj` were used to adjust the
background signal. This causes `mcaSmoother()` to use the subset of the
data between 20 °C and 35 °C for the linear regression and background
correction. To determine the $Tm$ of the first probe (positive sign) and
the second (negative sign) probe `diffQ()` was used with `min` and `max`
for argument `fct`, respectively. In the loop the corresponding $Tm$
values were assigned to the matrix `RES` and the melting curve is drawn.
In addition to the lines the $Tm$s were added
(Figure [12](#figure:DUPLEX_melt)).

``` r
# Create an empty matrix ("RES") for the results of the peak values (Tm) and peak 
# heights (F).
RES <- matrix(NA, 3, 4, dimnames = list(colnames(data.tmp[, 2:4]),
	      c("F 1", "Tm 1", "F 2", "Tm 2")))
                   
# Use mcaSmoother to preprocess the raw data. 
# Use a background correction (20-35 degree Celsius). 
# Apply the smoothed data to diffQ, calculate the peak values for the extremes 
# (minimum and maximum) and assign the results to the matrix "RES".
# Plot the smoothed data with the peak values and peak heights.
for (i in c(1:3)) {
  tmp <- mcaSmoother(data.tmp[, 1], data.tmp[, i + 1], bgadj = TRUE, bg = c(20, 35))
  lines(data.frame(diffQ(tmp, verbose = TRUE)["xy"]), col = i)
  RES[i, 1] <- round(diffQ(tmp, fct = max)[[2]], 2)      #fluoTm
  RES[i, 2] <- round(diffQ(tmp, fct = max)[[1]], 2)      #Tm
  RES[i, 3] <- round(diffQ(tmp, fct = min)[[2]], 2)      #fluoTm
  RES[i, 4] <- round(diffQ(tmp, fct = min)[[1]], 2)      #Tm
}
legend(20, 0.6, names(data.tmp[, 2:4]), lty = 1, bty = "n", col = 1:3)
points(RES[, 2], RES[, 1], pch = 19, col = 4, cex = 2)
points(RES[, 4], RES[, 3], pch = 19, col = 1, cex = 2)
```

Figure [12](#figure:DUPLEX_melt) shows that $Poly(dA)_{20}$ melts as
single sharp peak at circa 48 °C. The detection probes *aCS* and
*$MLC{-2v}$* had a single peak at a higher $Tm$ of circa 74 °C. Both,
the number and the separation of the peaks were consistent to the
estimated theoretical temperatures[^18] (not shown). The results of the
matrix `RES` are shown in Table [2](#table:tab_DUPLEX_melt). The $Tm$ of
$Poly(dA)_{20}$ alone and $Poly(dA)_{20}$ combined with another
detection probe differed slightly. This is presumably due to different
capture immobilization strategies and/or *bCP/DP* interactions
(unpublished data).

## Multiplex SNP detection

SNPs are important diagnostic markers for example in cardiac diseases
[@Villard2005; @Muthumala2008]. SNPs alter thermodynamic properties of
dsDNA and thus the $Tm$. In proof-of-principle experiments melting
curves were obtained from sequences of human *VIM* with a single base
exchange[^19]. We used the previously reported [@Roediger2012a]
dual-hybridization probe on microbeads to analyze the $Tm$ shift (inset
Figure [13](#figure:Mutation_melt_fig19)).

![Figure 13: []{#figure:Mutation_melt_fig19
label="figure:Mutation_melt_fig19"} Proof-of-principle SNP detection
with dual-hybridization assays on microbead surfaces. The melting
temperature of the artificial mutated
*VIM* ([**╍╍╍**]{style="color: green"}) (C $\rightarrow$ T) is lower
compared to the native *VIM* ([**╍╍╍**]{style="color: red"}).
*$MLC{-2v}$* ([╍╍╍]{style="color: blue"}) was used as reference for
inter-assay variance. In the negative control
*SERCA2* ([**╍╍╍**]{style="color: cyan"}) no significant $Tm$ was
detected.](figures/Mutation_melt_fig19.png){#figure:Mutation_melt_fig19
width="100%" alt="graphic without alt text"}

The temperature resolution was 0.5 °C per step. The `DualHyb` data were
preprocessed with `mcaSmoother()` in a loop. The $Tm$ and intensity
($fluoTm$) were stored in the matrix `RES`.

``` r
# Load DualHyb data set.
data(DualHyb)

# Create an empty matrix ("RES") for the results of the peak values (TmD1) 
# and calculated peak heights (fluoTm).
RES <- matrix(NA, 4, 2, dimnames = list(colnames(DualHyb[, 2:5]), 
              c("fluoTm", "TmD1")))

# Use mcaSmoother to check and smooth the raw data. 
# Apply diffQ to the smoothed data, calculate the peak values for the extreme 
# (minimum) and assign the results to the matrix "RES".       
for (i in c(1:4)) {
  tmp <- mcaSmoother(DualHyb[, 1], DualHyb[, i + 1])
  RES[i, 1] <- round(diffQ(tmp, fct = min)[[2]], 2)     # fluoTm
  RES[i, 2] <- round(diffQ(tmp, fct = min)[[1]], 2)     # Tm
}
```

Calling `RES` gives the following output:

``` r
# Call RES to show the peak values and peak heights.
RES
                fluoTm  TmD1
MLC2v            -0.48 76.62
SERCA2           -0.04 62.87
VIM.w.Mutation   -0.33 71.67
VIM.wo.Mutation  -0.32 73.29
```

The algorithm calculated for the muted *VIM* a $Tm$ of 71.67 °C which is
1.62 °C lower than the native *VIM*
(Figure [13](#figure:Mutation_melt_fig19)). This is in agreement with
expected behavior. The negative control (unspecific *bCP* for *SERCA2*)
had a $Tm$ of 62.87 ° C. But looking at the intensity showed that
*SERCA2* is very low ($-0.04$). For screening purposes a simple cut-off
would exclude this sample. The reference *$MLC{-2v}$* had a $Tm$ of
76.62 °C. Thus the method can be applied to identify SNPs. High
multiplex level was achieved by using different capture probe microbead
combinations. In this example a low temperature resolution of 0.5 °C per
step was used. However, since lower heating rates are positively
correlated with a higher resolution for SNP analysis generally higher
resolutions are recommended. The temperature resolution of the raw data
can be analyzed with `diffQ(..., verbose = TRUE)[["temperature"]]`.

# Summary and discussion

Experimental hardware platforms often require the development of adapted
software, in particular in cases where the hardware affects the signal
(e. g., photo bleaching). R is an optimal tool for such scenarios.
Within this article we proposed the *MBmca* package for MCA on microbead
surfaces. The functions of the package were used for different
detection-probe-systems, including direct hybridization of DNA dulexes
or dual-hybridization probes for SNP detection. The
capture-probe-systems produce unique melting profiles which allowed
simple and rapid discrimination of different DNA sequences in one
sample. The functions are useful to preprocess and inspect the data and
to determine melting temperatures of immobilized DNA fragments. While
used in this study for identification and quantification of biomolecules
attached to microbeads it is applicable for MCA in solution too (not
shown).

It was assumed that a quadratic polynomial at the approximate melting
peaks can be used to calculate an accurate $Tm$. One drawback is that
the local quadratic polynomial use a predefined number ($n~=~1,\dots,8$)
of left and right approximate melting peaks neighbors. From experience
this approach proved to be reliable for the temperature resolution of
$0.5--1$ °C per step as used in the present and the study of
@Roediger2012a. Preliminary tests in solution using the LightCycler 2.0
(Roche) with high resolution ($\geq 0.1$ °C per step) suggest that the
method works too (not shown). This implementation is designed to meet
the needs of a certain experimental setup and therefore may require
evaluation prior to use in new applications. Besides $Tm$ $Tm_{1}^{D2}$
and $Tm_{2}^{D2}$ were proposed as additional values to describe early
and late phases of the melting process on surfaces. Particularly, in
investigations on the impact of the capture probe immobilization
strategy or capture probe surface density these values might be useful.
Methods to determine the area under the curve (AUC) were not taken into
consideration due to the fact that photobleaching and quenching effects
play an unknown role and are still an ongoing matter of debate in the
literature. In practical terms it is recommended to implement functions
from the *MBmca* package in an R GUI (see @Valero-Mora2012), e. g.,
*RKWard*[^20] [@Roediger2012b]. GUIs provide more intuitive means to
perform multiplex high-throughput analysis with visual feedback and
enrichment with additional information like goodness of fit or peak
heights.
