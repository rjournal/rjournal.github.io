title: Surface Melting Curve Analysis with R
abstract: Nucleic acid Melting Curve Analysis is a powerful method to investigate
  the interaction of double stranded nucleic acids. Many researchers rely on closed
  source software which is not ubiquitously available, and gives only little control
  over the computation and data presentation. R in contrast, is open source, highly
  adaptable and provides numerous utilities for data import, sophisticated statistical
  analysis and presentation in publication quality. This article covers methods, implemented
  in the MBmca package, for DNA Melting Curve Analysis on microbead surfaces. Particularly,
  the use of the second derivative melting peaks is suggested as an additional parameter
  to characterize the melting behavior of DNA duplexes. Examples of microbead surface
  Melting Curve Analysis on fragments of human genes are presented.
