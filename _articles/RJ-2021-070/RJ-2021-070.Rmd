title: 'survidm: An R package for Inference and Prediction in an Illness-Death Model'
abstract: Multi-state models are a useful way of describing a process in which an
  individual moves through a number of finite states in continuous time. The illness-death
  model plays a central role in the theory and practice of these models, describing
  the dynamics of healthy subjects who may move to an intermediate "diseased" state
  before entering into a terminal absorbing state. In these models, one important
  goal is the modeling of transition rates which is usually done by studying the relationship
  between covariates and disease evolution. However, biomedical researchers are also
  interested in reporting other interpretable results in a simple and summarized manner.
  These include estimates of predictive probabilities, such as the transition probabilities,
  occupation probabilities, cumulative incidence functions, and the sojourn time distributions.
  The development of survidm package has been motivated by recent contribution that
  provides answers to all these topics. An illustration of the software usage is included
  using real data.
