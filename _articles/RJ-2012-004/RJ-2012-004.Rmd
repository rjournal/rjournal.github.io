title: Foreign Library Interface
abstract: We present an improved Foreign Function Interface (FFI) for R to call arbitary
  native functions without the need for C wrapper code. Further we discuss a dynamic
  linkage framework for binding standard C libraries to R across platforms using a
  universal type information format. The package rdyncall comprises the framework
  and an initial repository of cross-platform bindings for standard libraries such
  as (legacy and modern) OpenGL, the family of SDL libraries and Expat. The package
  enables system-level programming using the R language; sample applications are given
  in the article. We outline the underlying automation tool-chain that extracts cross-platform
  bindings from C headers, making the repository extendable and open for library developers.
