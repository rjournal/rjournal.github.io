title: 'RTextTools: A Supervised Learning Package for Text Classification'
abstract: Social scientists have long hand-labeled texts to create datasets useful
  for studying topics from congressional policymaking to media reporting. Many social
  scientists have begun to incorporate machine learning into their toolkits. RTextTools
  was designed to make machine learning accessible by providing a start-to-finish
  product in less than 10 steps. After installing RTextTools, the initial step is
  to generate a document term matrix. Second, a container object is created, which
  holds all the objects needed for further analysis. Third, users can use up to nine
  algorithms to train their data. Fourth, the data are classified. Fifth, the classification
  is summarized. Sixth, functions are available for performance evaluation. Seventh,
  ensemble agreement is conducted. Eighth, users can cross-validate their data. Finally,
  users write their data to a spreadsheet, allowing for further manual coding if required.
