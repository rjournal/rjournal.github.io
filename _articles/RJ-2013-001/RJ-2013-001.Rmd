# Introduction

The process of hand-labeling texts according to topic, tone, and other
quantifiable variables has yielded datasets offering insight into
questions that span social science, such as the representation of
citizen priorities in national policymaking [@jones2009representation]
and the effects of media framing on public opinion
[@baumgartner2008decline]. This process of hand-labeling, known in the
field as "manual coding", is highly time consuming. To address this
challenge, many social scientists have begun to incorporate machine
learning into their toolkits. As computer scientists have long known,
machine learning has the potential to vastly reduce the amount of time
researchers spend manually coding data. Additionally, although machine
learning cannot replicate the ability of a human coder to interpret the
nuances of a text in context, it does allow researchers to examine
systematically both texts and coding scheme performance in a way that
humans cannot. Thus, the potential for heightened efficiency and
perspective make machine learning an attractive approach for social
scientists both with and without programming experience.

Yet despite the rising interest in machine learning and the existence of
several packages in R, no package incorporates a start-to-finish product
that would be appealing to those social scientists and other researchers
without technical expertise in this area. We offer to fill this gap
through [*RTextTools*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=RTextTools).
Using a variety of existing R packages, *RTextTools* is designed as a
one-stop-shop for conducting supervised learning with textual data. In
this paper, we outline a nine-step process, discuss the core functions
of the program, and demonstrate the use of *RTextTools* with a working
example.

The core philosophy driving
[*RTextTools*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=RTextTools)'
development is to create a package that is easy to use for individuals
with no prior R experience, yet flexible enough for power users to
utilize advanced techniques. Overall, *RTextTools* offers a
comprehensive approach to text classification, by interfacing with
existing text pre-processing routines and machine learning algorithms
and by providing new analytics functions. While existing packages can be
used to perform text preprocessing and machine learning, respectively,
no package combines these processes with analytical functions for
evaluating machine learning accuracy. In short,
[*RTextTools*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=RTextTools) expedites
the text classification process: everything from the installation
process to training and classifying has been streamlined to make machine
learning with text data more accessible.

# General workflow {#workflow}

A user starts by loading his or her data from an Access, CSV, Excel
file, or series of text files using the `read_data()` function. We use a
small and randomized subset of the congressional bills database
constructed by [@Adler+Wilkerson:2004] for the running example offered
here.[^1] We choose this truncated dataset in order to minimize the
amount of memory used, which can rapidly overwhelm a computer when using
large text corpora. Most users therefore should be able to reproduce the
example. However, the resulting predictions tend to improve
(nonlinearly) with the size of the reference dataset, meaning that our
results here are not as good as they would be using the full
congressional bills dataset. Computers with at least 4GB of memory
should be able to run *RTextTools* on medium to large datasets (i.e., up
to 30,000 texts) by using the three low-memory algorithms included:
general linearized models [@friedman2010regularization] from the
[*glmnet*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=glmnet) package, maximum
entropy [@Jurka:2012] from
[*maxent*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=maxent), and support
vector machines [@e1071_pkg] from
[*e1071*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=e1071). For users with
larger datasets, we recommend a cloud computing service such as Amazon
EC2.

# 1. Creating a matrix

First, we load our data with `data(USCongress)`, and use the
[*tm*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=tm) package
[@feinerer2008text] to create a document-term matrix. The `USCongress`
dataset comes with *RTextTools* and hence the function `data` is
relevant only to data emanating from R packages. Researchers with data
in Access, CSV, Excel, or text files will want to load data via the
`read_data()` function. Several pre-processing options from the *tm*
package are available at this stage, including stripping whitespace,
removing sparse terms, word stemming, and stopword removal for several
languages.[^2] We want readers to be able to reproduce our example, so
we set `removeSparseTerms` to .998, which vastly reduces the size of the
document-term matrix, although it may also reduce accuracy in real-world
applications. Users should consult @feinerer2008text to take full
advantage of preprocessing possibilities. Finally, note that the text
column can be encapsulated in a `cbind()` data frame, which allows the
user to perform supervised learning on multiple columns if necessary.

``` r
data(USCongress)

# CREATE THE DOCUMENT-TERM MATRIX
doc_matrix <- create_matrix(USCongress$text, language="english", removeNumbers=TRUE, 
                            stemWords=TRUE, removeSparseTerms=.998)
```

# 2. Creating a container

The matrix is then partitioned into a container, which is essentially a
list of objects that will be fed to the machine learning algorithms in
the next step. The output is of class `matrix_container` and includes
separate train and test sparse matrices, corresponding vectors of train
and test codes, and a character vector of term label names. Looking at
the example below, `doc_matrix` is the document term matrix created in
the previous step, and `USCongress$major` is a vector of document labels
taken from the `USCongress` dataset. `trainSize` and `testSize` indicate
which documents to put into the training set and test set, respectively.
The first 4,000 documents will be used to train the machine learning
model, and the last 449 documents will be set aside to test the model.
In principle, users do not have to store both documents and labels in a
single dataset, although it greatly simplifies the process. So long as
the documents correspond to the document labels via the `trainSize` and
`testSize` parameters, `create_container()` will work properly. Finally,
the `virgin` parameter is set to `FALSE` because we are still in the
evaluation stage and not yet ready to classify virgin documents.

``` r
container <- create_container(doc_matrix, USCongress$major, trainSize=1:4000, 
                              testSize=4001:4449, virgin=FALSE)
```

From this point, users pass the container into every subsequent
function. An ensemble of up to nine algorithms can be trained and
classified.

# 3. Training models

The `train_model()` function takes each algorithm, one by one, to
produce an object passable to `classify_model()`. A convenience
`train_models()` function trains all models at once by passing in a
vector of model requests.[^3] The syntax below demonstrates model
creation for all nine algorithms. For expediency, users replicating this
analysis may want to use just the three low-memory algorithms: support
vector machine [@e1071_pkg], glmnet [@friedman2010regularization], and
maximum entropy [@Jurka:2012].[^4] The other six algorithms include:
scaled linear discriminant analysis (slda) and bagging [@ipred_pkg] from
[*ipred*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=ipred); boosting
[@catools_pkg] from
[*caTools*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=caTools); random forest
[@liaw2002classification] from
[*randomForest*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=randomForest);
neural networks [@Venables+Ripley:2002] from
[*nnet*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=nnet); and classification or
regression tree [@tree_pkg] from
[*tree*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=tree). Please see the
aforementioned references to find out more about the specifics of these
algorithms and the packages from which they originate. Finally,
additional arguments can be passed to `train_model()` via the `â¦`
argument.

``` r
SVM <- train_model(container,"SVM")
GLMNET <- train_model(container,"GLMNET")
MAXENT <- train_model(container,"MAXENT")
SLDA <- train_model(container,"SLDA")	
BOOSTING <- train_model(container,"BOOSTING")
BAGGING <- train_model(container,"BAGGING")
RF <- train_model(container,"RF")
NNET <- train_model(container,"NNET")
TREE <- train_model(container,"TREE")
```

# 4. Classifying data using trained models

The functions `classify_model()` and `classify_models()` use the same
syntax as `train_model()`. Each model created in the previous step is
passed on to `classify_model()`, which then returns the classified data.

``` r
SVM_CLASSIFY <- classify_model(container, SVM)
GLMNET_CLASSIFY <- classify_model(container, GLMNET)
MAXENT_CLASSIFY <- classify_model(container, MAXENT)
SLDA_CLASSIFY <- classify_model(container, SLDA)
BOOSTING_CLASSIFY <- classify_model(container, BOOSTING)
BAGGING_CLASSIFY <- classify_model(container, BAGGING)
RF_CLASSIFY <- classify_model(container, RF)
NNET_CLASSIFY <- classify_model(container, NNET)
TREE_CLASSIFY <- classify_model(container, TREE)
```

# 5. Analytics

The most crucial step during the machine learning process is
interpreting the results, and *RTextTools* provides a function called
`create_analytics()` to help users understand the classification of
their test set data. The function returns a container with four
different summaries: by label (e.g., topic), by algorithm, by document,
and an ensemble summary.

Each summary's contents will differ depending on whether the virgin flag
was set to `TRUE` or `FALSE` in the `create_container()` function in
Step 3. For example, when the virgin flag is set to `FALSE`, indicating
that all data in the training and testing sets have corresponding
labels, `create_analytics()` will check the results of the learning
algorithms against the true values to determine the accuracy of the
process. However, if the virgin flag is set to `TRUE`, indicating that
the testing set is unclassified data with no known true values,
`create_analytics()` will return as much information as possible without
comparing each predicted value to its true label.

The label summary provides statistics for each unique label in the
classified data (e.g., each topic category). This includes the number of
documents that were manually coded with that unique label
(`NUM_MANUALLY_CODED`), the number of document sthat were coded using
the ensemble method (`NUM_CONSENSUS_CODED`), the number of documents
that were coded using the probability method (`NUM_PROBABILITY_CODED`),
the rate of over- or under-coding with each method
(`PCT_CONSENSUS_CODED` and `PCT_PROBABILITY_CODED`), and the percentage
that were correctly coded using either the ensemble method or the
probability method (`PCT_CORRECTLY_CODED_CONSENSUS` or
`PCT_CORRECTLY_CODED_PROBABILITY`, respectively).

The algorithm summary provides a breakdown of each algorithm's
performance for each unique label in the classified data. This includes
metrics such as precision, recall, f-scores, and the accuracy of each
algorithm's results as compared to the true data.[^5]

The document summary provides all the raw data available for each
document. By document, it displays each algorithm's prediction
(`ALGORITHM_LABEL`), the algorithm's probability score
(`ALGORITHM_PROB`), the number of algorithms that agreed on the same
label (`CONSENSUS_AGREE`), which algorithm had the highest probability
score for its prediction (`PROBABILITY_CODE`), and the original label of
the document (`MANUAL_CODE`). Finally, the `create_analytics()` function
outputs information pertaining to ensemble analysis, which is discussed
in its own section.

Summary and print methods are available for `create_analytics()`, but
users can also store each summary in separate data frames for further
analysis or writing to disk. Parameters include the container object and
a matrix or `cbind()` object of classified results.[^6]

``` r
analytics <- create_analytics(container,
                              cbind(SVM_CLASSIFY, SLDA_CLASSIFY, 
                                    BOOSTING_CLASSIFY, BAGGING_CLASSIFY, 
                                    RF_CLASSIFY, GLMNET_CLASSIFY, 
                                    NNET_CLASSIFY, TREE_CLASSIFY, 
                                    MAXENT_CLASSIFY))
summary(analytics)

# CREATE THE data.frame SUMMARIES
topic_summary <- analytics@label_summary
alg_summary <- analytics@algorithm_summary
ens_summary <-analytics@ensemble_summary
doc_summary <- analytics@document_summary
```

# 6. Testing algorithm accuracy {#testing}

While there are many techniques used to evaluate algorithmic performance
[@mclaughlin2004collaborative], the summary call to `create_analytics()`
produces precision, recall and f-scores for analyzing algorithmic
performance at the aggregate level. Precision refers to how often a case
the algorithm predicts as belonging to a class actually belongs to that
class. For example, in the context of the `USCongress` data, precision
tells us what proportion of bills an algorithm deems to be about defense
are actually about defense (based on the gold standard of human-assigned
labels). In contrast, recall refers to the proportion of bills in a
class the algorithm correctly assigns to that class. In other words,
what percentage of actual defense bills did the algorithm correctly
classify? F-scores produce a weighted average of both precision and
recall, where the highest level of performance is equal to 1 and the
lowest 0 [@sokolova2006beyond].

Users can quickly compare algorithm performance. For instance, our
working example shows that the SVM, glmnet, maximum entropy, random
forest, SLDA, and boosting vastly outperform the other algorithms in
terms of f-scores, precision, and recall. For instance, SVM's f-score is
0.65 whereas SLDA's f-score is 0.63, essentially no difference. Thus, if
analysts wish to only use one algorithm, any of these top algorithms
will produce comparable results. Based on these results, Bagging, Tree,
and NNET should not be used singly.[^7]

  ----------------------------------------------
  Algorithm         Precision   Recall   F-score
  --------------- ----------- -------- ---------
  SVM                    0.67     0.65      0.65

  Glmnet                 0.68     0.64      0.64

  SLDA                   0.64     0.63      0.63

  Random Forest          0.68     0.62      0.63

  Maxent                 0.60     0.62      0.60

  Boosting               0.65     0.59      0.59

  Bagging                0.52     0.39      0.39

  Tree                   0.20     0.22      0.18

  NNET                   0.07     0.12      0.08
  ----------------------------------------------

  : Table 1: Overall algorithm precision, recall, and f-scores.

# 7. Ensemble agreement {#ensemble}

We recommend ensemble (consensus) agreement to enhance labeling
accuracy. Ensemble agreement simply refers to whether multiple
algorithms make the same prediction concerning the class of an event
(i.e., did SVM and maximum entropy assign the same label to the text?).
Using a four-ensemble agreement approach, @collingwood2012tradeoffs
found that when four of their algorithms agree on the label of a textual
document, the machine label matches the human label over 90% of the
time. The rate is just 45% when only two algorithms agree on the text
label.

*RTextTools* includes `create_ensembleSummary()`, which calculates both
recall accuracy and coverage for **n** ensemble agreement. Coverage simply
refers to the percentage of documents that meet the recall accuracy
threshold. For instance, say we find that when seven algorithms agree on
the label of a bill, our overall accuracy is 90% (when checked against
our true values). Then, let's say, we find that only 20% of our bills
meet that criterion. If we have 10 bills and only two bills meet the
seven ensemble agreement threshold, then our coverage is 20%.
Mathematically, if $k$ represents the percent of cases that meet the
ensemble threshold, and $n$ represents total cases, coverage is
calculated in the following way:

$$\mbox{Coverage} = \frac{k}{n}$$

Users can test their accuracy using a variety of ensemble cut-points,
which is demonstrated below. TableÂ [1](#ensemble_agree) reports the
coverage and recall accuracy for different levels of ensemble agreement.
The general trend is for coverage to decrease while recall increases.
For example, just 11% of the congressional bills in our data have nine
algorithms that agree. However, recall accuracy is 100% for those bills
when the 9 algorithms do agree. Considering that 90% is often social
scientists' inter-coder reliability standard, one may be comfortable
using a 6 ensemble agreement with these data because we label 66% of the
data with accuracy at 90%.[^8]

``` r

create_ensembleSummary(analytics@document_summary)
```

::: {#ensemble_agree}
  -----------------------------
              Coverage   Recall
  --------- ---------- --------
    n \>= 2       1.00     0.77

    n \>= 3       0.98     0.78

    n \>= 4       0.90     0.82

    n \>= 5       0.78     0.87

    n \>= 6       0.66     0.90

    n \>= 7       0.45     0.94

    n \>= 8       0.29     0.96

    n \>= 9       0.11     1.00
  -----------------------------

  : Table 2: Ensemble agreement coverage and recall.
:::

# 8. Cross validation

Users may use n-fold cross validation to calculate the accuracy of each
algorithm on their dataset and determine which algorithms to use in
their ensemble. *RTextTools* provides a convenient `cross_validate()`
function to perform n-fold cross validation. Note that when deciding the
appropriate n-fold it is important to consider the total sample size so
that enough data are in both the train and test sets to produce useful
results.

``` r
SVM <- cross_validate(container, 4, "SVM")
GLMNET <- cross_validate(container, 4, "GLMNET")
MAXENT <- cross_validate(container, 4, "MAXENT")
SLDA <- cross_validate(container, 4, "SLDA")
BAGGING <- cross_validate(container, 4, "BAGGING")
BOOSTING <- cross_validate(container, 4, "BOOSTING")
RF <- cross_validate(container, 4, "RF")
NNET <- cross_validate(container, 4, "NNET")
TREE <- cross_validate(container, 4, "TREE")
```

# 9. Exporting data

Finally, some users may want to write out the newly labeled data for
continued manual labeling on texts that do not achieve high enough
accuracy requirements during ensemble agreement. Researchers can then
have human coders verify and label these data to improve accuracy. In
this case, the document summary object generated from `create_analytics`
can be easily exported to a CSV file.

``` r
write.csv(analytics@document_summary, "DocumentSummary.csv")
```

# Conclusion

Although a user can get started with *RTextTools* in less than ten
steps, many more options are available that help to remove noise, refine
trained models, and ultimately improve accuracy. If you want more
control over your data, please refer to the documentation bundled with
the package. Moreover, we hope that the package will become increasingly
useful and flexible over time as advanced users develop add-on
functions. *RTextTools* is completely open-source, and a link to the
source code repository as well as a host of other information can be
found at the project's website -- <http://www.rtexttools.com>.
