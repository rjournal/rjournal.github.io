title: 'rainbow: An R Package for Visualizing Functional Time Series'
abstract: Recent advances in computer technology have tremendously increased the use
  of functional data, whose graphical representation can be infinite-dimensional curves,
  images or shapes. This article describes four methods for visualizing functional
  time series using an R add-on package. These methods are demonstrated using age-specific
  Australian fertility data from 1921 to 2006 and monthly sea surface temperatures
  from January 1950 to December 2006.
