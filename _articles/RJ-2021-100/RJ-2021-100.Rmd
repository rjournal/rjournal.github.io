title: 'DRHotNet: An R package for detecting differential risk hotspots on a linear
  network'
abstract: One of the most common applications of spatial data analysis is detecting
  zones, at a certain scale, where a point-referenced event under study is especially
  concentrated. The detection of such zones, which are usually referred to as hotspots,
  is essential in certain fields such as criminology, epidemiology, or traffic safety.
  Traditionally, hotspot detection procedures have been developed over areal units
  of analysis. Although working at this spatial scale can be suitable enough for many
  research or practical purposes, detecting hotspots at a more accurate level (for
  instance, at the road segment level) may be more convenient sometimes. Furthermore,
  it is typical that hotspot detection procedures are entirely focused on the determination
  of zones where an event is (overall) highly concentrated. It is less common, by
  far, that such procedures focus on detecting zones where a specific type of event
  is overrepresented in comparison with the other types observed, which have been
  denoted as differential risk hotspots. The R package DRHotNet provides several functionalities
  to facilitate the detection of differential risk hotspots within a linear network.
  In this paper, DRHotNet is depicted, and its usage in the R console is shown through
  a detailed analysis of a crime dataset.
