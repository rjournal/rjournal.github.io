title: 'Inventorymodel: an R Package for Centralized Inventory Problems'
abstract: Inventory management of goods is an integral part of logistics systems;
  common to various economic sectors such as industry, agriculture and trade; and
  independent of production volume. In general, as companies seek to minimize economic
  losses, studies on problems of multi-agent inventory have increased in recent years.
  A multi-agent inventory problem is a situation in which several agents face individual
  inventory problems and agree to coordinate their orders with the objective of reducing
  their costs. The R package Inventorymodel allows the determination of both the optimal
  policy for some inventory situations with deterministic demands and the allocation
  of costs from a game-theoretic perspective. The required calculations may be computed
  for any number of agents although the computational complexity of this class of
  problems when the involved agents enlarge is not reduced. In this work, the different
  possibilities that the package offers are described and some examples of usage are
  also demonstrated.
