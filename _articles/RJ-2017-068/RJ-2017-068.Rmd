title: 'rpsftm: An R Package for Rank Preserving Structural Failure Time Models'
abstract: Treatment switching in a randomised controlled trial occurs when participants
  change from their randomised treatment to the other trial treatment during the study.
  Failure to account for treatment switching in the analysis (i.e. by performing a
  standard intention-to-treat analysis) can lead to biased estimates of treatment
  efficacy. The rank preserving structural failure time model (RPSFTM) is a method
  used to adjust for treatment switching in trials with survival outcomes. The RPSFTM
  is due to Robins and Tsiatis (1991) and has been developed by White et al. (1997,
  1999). The method is randomisation based and uses only the randomised treatment
  group, observed event times, and treatment history in order to estimate a causal
  treatment effect. The treatment effect, ψ, is estimated by balancing counter-factual
  event times (that would be observed if no treatment were received) between treatment
  groups. G-estimation is used to find the value of ψ such that a test statistic Z
  (ψ) = 0. This is usually the test statistic used in the intention-to-treat analysis,
  for example, the log rank test statistic. We present an R package, rpsftm, that
  implements the method.
