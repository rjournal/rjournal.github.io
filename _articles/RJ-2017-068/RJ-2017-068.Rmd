title: 'rpsftm: An R Package for Rank Preserving Structural Failure Time Models'
abstract: |
  Treatment switching in a randomised controlled trial occurs when
  participants change from their randomised treatment to the other trial
  treatment during the study. Failure to account for treatment switching
  in the analysis (i.e. by performing a standard intention-to-treat
  analysis) can lead to biased estimates of treatment efficacy. The rank
  preserving structural failure time model (RPSFTM) is a method used to
  adjust for treatment switching in trials with survival outcomes. The
  RPSFTM is due to [@robins:91] and has been developed by
  [@white:97; @white:99].\
  The method is randomisation based and uses only the randomised
  treatment group, observed event times, and treatment history in order
  to estimate a causal treatment effect. The treatment effect, $\psi$,
  is estimated by balancing counter-factual event times (that would be
  observed if no treatment were received) between treatment groups.
  G-estimation is used to find the value of $\psi$ such that a test
  statistic $Z\left(\psi\right) = 0$. This is usually the test statistic
  used in the intention-to-treat analysis, for example, the log rank
  test statistic.\
  We present an R package, *rpsftm*, that implements the method.

# Introduction

In a two-arm randomised controlled trial, participants are randomly
allocated to receive one of two treatments or interventions. Ideally,
all participants would fully receive their allocated treatment and no
other treatment. However, in a recent review, 98 of 100 trials published
in four high quality general medical journals reported some form of
departure from randomised treatment [@dodd:12]. When treatment is
'all-or-nothing' (for example, a surgical procedure), possible
departures include not receiving the allocated treatment, receiving the
other trial treatment, or receiving a non-trial treatment. When
treatment is given over time (for example, a drug for HIV treatment),
departures also occur over time, and often include starting a new
treatment in response to a disease-related event.

This paper specifically focuses on the case of treatment switching over
time, where participants may switch to receive the other trial treatment
during the trial [@latimer:14]. A common example is in a trial of active
treatment versus placebo where placebo arm participants may start the
active treatment in response to disease progression.

A randomised controlled trial with departures from randomised treatment
is commonly analysed by intention-to-treat, in which departures from
randomised treatment are ignored and all randomised participants are
compared in the groups to which they were randomised [@cochrane:17].
This provides an unbiased comparison of two treatment policies, which
accept that treatment may be changed, but does not compare the
efficacies of the treatments themselves [@white:99].

In order to compare the efficacies of the treatments, analysts often use
per-protocol analysis, which censors participants when they depart from
randomised treatment. However, this loses the advantage that
randomisation produces comparable groups and instead introduces
selection bias. Another possibility is to include treatment as a
time-dependent variable in a Cox regression model. The issue with this
method is that the estimate of treatment effect may not have a causal
interpretation when switchers are prognostically different to
non-switchers [@robins:91].

There has therefore been strong interest in causal inference methods
including marginal structural models (MSM) (i.e. inverse probability of
censoring weighting (IPCW)) [@hernan:01] and instrumental-variable-type
methods [@white:05; @watkins:13].

The IPCW method is an extension of the per-protocol censoring approach,
whereby the bias associated with censoring participants that depart from
randomised treatment is removed by weighting the remaining non-switchers
[@latimer:16]. A model is formed for the probability of switching using
baseline and time-dependent covariates. Time-varying weights are then
obtained for each participant based on the inverse probability of not
switching until a given time [@watkins:13]. The method relies on data on
prognostic factors for mortality that also affect the probability of
switching being collected at both baseline and over time. This is called
the 'no unmeasured confounders' assumption. Since this assumption is
untestable, the method relies on good planning at the study design stage
in order to collect information on all possible confounders. The method
also has two potential issues: a) if many prognostic factors are
included in the model to calculate weights the model may fail to
converge, and b) if only a few participants switch then large weights
are assigned to the remaining participants, which may result in biased
analyses. The method has already been implemented in R in the package
[*ipw*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=ipw) [@ipw:11] and so is not
considered further here.

Instead, this paper focuses on a popular causal method - the rank
preserving structural failure time model (RPSFTM) [@robins:91]. In
contrast to the IPCW method which requires potential confounders to be
collected over time, the RPSFTM is randomisation based and only requires
information on the randomised treatment group, observed event times, and
treatment history in order to estimate a causal treatment effect. The
method has been used, for example, in submissions to the UK's National
Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence whose Decision Support Unit
commissioned a guidance document [@latimerabrams:14]. The RPSFTM has
been implemented in Stata [@white:02] but not in R.

This paper describes the theory of the RPSFTM and presents a new
implementation of the method with the R package
[*rpsftm*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=rpsftm) [@rpsftm], using
data based on a trial in HIV infection.

# Theory

## RPSFTM method and assumptions

The RPSFTM uses a causal model to produce counter-factual event times
(the time that would be observed if no treatment were received) in order
to estimate a causal treatment effect. Let
$T_i = T_i^{\mbox{off}} + T_i^{\mbox{on}}$ be the observed event time
for participant $i$, where $T_i^{\mbox{off}}$ and $T_i^{\mbox{on}}$
represent the time spent off and on treatment, respectively. The $T_i$
are related to the counter-factual event times, $U_i$, via the following
causal model:

$$U_i = T_i^{\mbox{off}} + T_i^{\mbox{on}}\exp\left(\psi_0\right), \label{eqn:untreated}   
(\#eq:eqnuntreated)$$

where $\exp\left(-\psi_0\right)$ is the acceleration factor associated
with treatment and $\psi_0$ is the true causal parameter.

A grid search (g-estimation) procedure is used to estimate the treatment
effect that balances the counter-factual event times across randomised
treatment groups. To estimate the causal treatment effect, $\psi$, we
assume that the $U_i$ are independent of randomised treatment group
$R_i$, i.e. if the groups are similar with respect to all other
characteristics except treatment, the average event times should be the
same in each group if no participant were treated. In general, this
assumption is plausible in a randomised controlled trial.

A g-estimation procedure is used to find the value of $\psi$ such that
$U_i$ is independent of $R_i.$ For a range of $\psi$s, the hypothesis
$\psi_0 = \psi$ is tested by computing $U_i\left(\psi\right),$ subject
to censoring, and calculating the test statistic $Z\left(\psi\right).$
This is usually the same test statistic as for the intention-to-treat
analysis, for example, the log rank test statistic to compare survival
distributions between groups. In the `rpsftm()` function, the possible
test options are the log rank, and the Wald test from a Cox or Weibull
regression model. For the parametric Weibull test, the point estimate
($\hat{\psi}$) is the value of $\psi$ for which
$Z\left(\psi\right) = 0$. For the non-parametric tests (log rank, Cox),
$\hat{\psi}$ is the value of $\psi$ for which $Z\left(\psi\right)$
crosses 0, since $Z\left(\psi\right)$ is a step function. Confidence
intervals are similarly found with the $100\left(1 - \alpha\right)\%$
confidence interval being the set
$\{\psi: |Z\left(\psi\right)| < z_{1-\alpha/2}\}$, where
$z_{1-\alpha/2}$ is the $1-\alpha/2$ percentile of the standard normal
distribution.

After finding $\hat{\psi}$, an adjusted hazard ratio can be calculated.
For example, by comparing counter-factual event times at $\hat{\psi}$ in
the control group to the observed event times in the experimental group
we can estimate the treatment effect that would have been observed in
the absence of switching (in the case where only the control group
switch).

As well as assuming that the only difference between randomised groups
is the treatment received, the RPSFTM also assumes a 'common treatment
effect'. The common treatment effect assumption states that the
treatment effect is the same for all participants (with respect to time
spent on treatment) regardless of when treatment is received, which is
implicit in equation (\@ref(eq:eqnuntreated)).

## Re-censoring

We assume that censoring occurs if participants survive to a specific
calendar date [@robins:91]. Thus the potential censoring time $C_i$ is
known for all participants. The censoring indicators of the observed
event times are initially carried over to the counter-factual event
times. However, the uninformative censoring on the $T_i$ scale may be
informative on the $U_i$ scale. Suppose we have two participants with
the same $U_i$, one of whom receives the superior treatment. The
participant receiving the superior treatment has their $U_i$ extended so
that they are censored whilst the other participant may observe the
event.

In detail, $C_i,$ the censoring times for the $T_i$, are transformed to
$C_i \left(1-P_i + P_i \exp\left(\psi\right)\right)$ when we work on the
$U_i$ scale, where $P_i$ is a random variable, the proportion of time on
treatment,
$T^{\mbox{on}}_i/\left(T^{\mbox{on}}_i +T^{\mbox{off}}_i\right).$ This
transformation of censoring times occurs by representing the censoring
status in two equivalent ways: $\{C_i< T_{i}\},$ and re-scaling both
sides
$\{C_i \left(1-P_i + P_i \exp\left(\psi\right)\right) <  T_i \left(1-P_i + P_i \exp(\psi)\right) = U_i \}.$
We cannot assume the variable $P_i$ is independent of $U_i.$ For
example, adherence to a protocolised treatment may depend on the
underlying prognosis.

We can overcome this induced dependence by considering the *sample
space* for $P_i$ marginally over $U_i$ and, optionally, conditioning on
$R_i$. If we replace $P_i$ with a function of its sample space then any
dependency on $U_i$ is thus removed. Any alternative transformed
censoring times must be smaller than the original censoring times, else
we may have to impute uncensored $U_i$ values for censored $T_i$
observations, which would be impossible. Hence taking the minimum value
from the sample space for $P_i$ meets both desiderata. If the sample
space differs between arms, say switching is impossible in one arm, then
this can be utilised to potentially observe more events with gains in
efficiency.

Operationally, let $C_i$ be the potential censoring time for participant
$i$. A participant is then re-censored at the minimum possible censoring
time:
$$D_i^*\left(\psi\right) = \min\left(C_i, C_i\exp\left(\psi\right)\right).$$
If $D_i^*\left(\psi\right) < U_i\left(\psi\right)$, then $U_i$ is
replaced by $D_i^*$ and the censoring indicator is replaced by 0. For
treatment arms where switching does not occur, there can be no
informative censoring and so re-censoring is not applied.

## Sensitivity analysis

As previously mentioned, the RPSFTM has two assumptions:

1.  The only difference between randomised groups is the treatment
    received.

2.  The treatment effect is the same for all participants regardless of
    when treatment is received.

Whilst the first assumption is plausible in a randomised controlled
trial, the latter may be unlikely to hold. For example, if control group
participants can only switch at disease progression then the treatment
benefit may be different in these participants compared to those
randomised to the experimental treatment. The `rpsftm()` function allows
for investigation of deviations from the common treatment effect
assumption by featuring a treatment-effect modifier variable which means
the treatment effect can be varied across participants. The assumption
that defines the counter-factual treatment-free event times $U_i$ is
thus modified by multiplying $\psi$ by some factor $k_i >0$:
$$U_i = T_i^{\mbox{off}} + T_i^{\mbox{on}}\exp\left(k_i\psi\right).$$
The value taken by $k_i$ is derived from observed data and is left to
the user to assign.

The package assumes that $k_i$ is determined at baseline, and
re-censoring is undertaken in a similar way by re-censoring at the
minimum possible censoring time:
$$D^{*}_i\left(\psi\right)=\min\left(C_i, C_i \exp\left(k_i \psi\right)\right).$$
Again, if $D^{*}_i\left(\psi\right)<U_i\left(\psi\right),$ then $U_i$ is
replaced by $D^*_i$ and the censoring indicator is replaced by 0. The
case where $k_i$ is observed post randomisation is equally valid in
terms of defining $U_i,$ but more complicated re-censoring may be
required, taking the minimum value of $D^*_i$ over the sample space of
$k_i$ conditional on arm. This is not implemented in the package.

# Using package *rpsftm*

The main function in the package *rpsftm* is of the same name,
`rpsftm()`, which returns an object that has `print`, `summary`, and
`plot` methods, and that inherits from the class used to define the test
statistic (`survdiff`, `coxph` or `survreg`) . The arguments to
`rpsftm()` are given in table [1](#tab:rpsftm_arguments) below.

## Example

The `rpsftm` function will be illustrated using a simulated dataset
`immdef` taken from [@white:02], based on a randomized controlled trial
[@concorde:94]. The trial compares two policies (immediate or deferred
treatment) of zidovudine treatment in symptom free participants infected
with HIV. The immediate treatment arm received treatment at
randomisation whilst the deferred arm received treatment either at onset
of AIDS related complex or AIDS (CDC group IV disease) or development of
persistently low CD4 count. The endpoint considered here was time from
study entry to progression to AIDS, or CDC group IV disease, or death.

### Data

The `immdef` data frame has 1000 rows of 9 variables as described in
table [2](#tab:immdef)

::: {#tab:immdef}
  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
              `immdef` variables
  ----------- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  `id`        participant ID number

  `def`       indicator that the participant was assigned to the Deferred treatment arm

  `imm`       indicator that the participant was assigned to the Immediate treatment arm

  `censyrs`   censoring time, in years, corresponding to the close of study minus the time of entry for each participant

  `xo`        an indicator that switching occurred

  `xoyrs`     the time, in years, from entry to switching, or 0 for participants in the Immediate arm

  `prog`      an indicator of disease progression (1), or censoring (0)

  `progyrs`   time, in years, from entry to disease progression or censoring

  `entry`     the time of entry into the study, measured in years from the date of randomisation
  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  : Table 2: Description of simulated data set
:::

The first six observations are given below

``` r
 > library(rpsftm)
 > head(immdef)
   id def imm censyrs xo    xoyrs prog  progyrs entry
 1  1   0   1       3  0 0.000000    0 3.000000     0
 2  2   1   0       3  1 2.652797    0 3.000000     0
 3  3   0   1       3  0 0.000000    1 1.737838     0
 4  4   0   1       3  0 0.000000    1 2.166291     0
 5  5   1   0       3  1 2.122100    1 2.884646     0
 6  6   1   0       3  1 0.557392    0 3.000000     0
```

For example, participant 2 was randomised to the deferred arm, started
treatment at 2.65 years and was censored at 3 years (the end of the
study). Subject 3 was randomised to the immediate treatment arm and
progressed (observed the event) at 1.74 years. Subject 5 was randomised
to the deferred treatment arm, started treatment at 2.12 years and
progressed at 2.88 years. The trial lasted 3 years with staggered entry
over the first 1.5 years. The variable censyrs gives the time from entry
to the end of the trial.

## Intention-to-treat analysis

First, we estimate the effect of giving zidovudine ignoring any
treatment changes during the trial. This is found by fitting an
accelerated failure time model using the
[*eha*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=eha) package [@eha:17]:

``` r
> library(eha)
> itt_fit <- aftreg(Surv(progyrs, prog) ~ imm, data = immdef)
> itt_fit
Call:
aftreg(formula = Surv(progyrs, prog) ~ imm, data = immdef)

Covariate          W.mean      Coef Time-Accn  se(Coef)    Wald p
imm                 0.510    -0.147     0.863     0.077     0.056 

Baseline parameters:
log(scale)                    1.404               0.062     0.000 
log(shape)                    0.392               0.052     0.000 
Baseline life expectancy:  

Events                    312 
Total time at risk        1932.5 
Max. log. likelihood      -855.14 
LR test statistic         3.69 
Degrees of freedom        1 
Overall p-value           0.0548817
```

The intention-to-treat estimate is $-0.147$ which means that lifetime is
used up $\exp\left(-0.147\right) = 0.863$ times as fast when on
zidovudine as when off zidovudine (or zidovudine extends lifetime by a
factor of $\exp\left(0.147\right) = 1.16$).

## Fitting the RPSFTM

We now show how to use `rpsftm` with the `immdef` data. First, a
variable `rx` for the proportion of time spent on treatment must be
created:

``` r
rx <- with(immdef, 1 - xoyrs / progyrs)
```

This sets `rx` to 1 in the immediate treatment arm (since no
participants could switch to the deferred arm, and `xoyrs = 0` in such
participants), 0 in the deferred arm participants that did not receive
treatment (as `xoyrs = progyrs` in such participants) and
`1 - xoyrs / progyrs` in the deferred arm participants that did receive
treatment. Using the default options, the fitted model is

``` r
rpsftm_fit_lr <- rpsftm(formula = Surv(progyrs, prog) ~ rand(imm, rx), 
                        data = immdef, 
                        censor_time = censyrs)
```

The above formula fits an RPSFTM where `progyrs` is the observed event
time, `prog` is the indicator of disease progression, `imm` is the
randomised treatment group indicator, `rx` is the proportion of time
spent on treatment and `censyrs` is the censoring time. The log rank
test is used in finding the point estimate of $\widehat{\psi}.$
Re-censoring is performed since the `censor_time` parameter is
specified; if not specified then re-censoring would not be performed.
After finding $\widehat{\psi},$ `rpsftm` refits the model at
$\widehat{\psi}$ and produces a `survdiff` object of the counter-factual
event times to be used in plotting Kaplan-Meier curves. The list of
objects that the function returns is given in table
[3](#tab:rpsftm_output).

:::

The point estimate and 95% confidence interval (CI) can be returned
using `rpsftm_fit_lr$psi` and `rpsftm_fit_lr$CI` which gives
$\widehat{\psi} = -0.181 \left(-0.350, 0.002\right),$ slightly larger
than in the intention-to-treat analysis. This means that lifetime is
used up $\exp\left(-0.181\right) = 0.834$ times as fast when on
zidovudine as when off zidovudine, i.e. the time to progression to AIDS,
or CDC group IV disease, or death is longer when on zidovudine
(treatment is beneficial). However, the confidence interval contains
zero, which suggests the treatment effect is non-significant. The
function `plot()` produces Kaplan-Meier curves of the counter-factual
event times in each group and can be used to check that the
distributions are indeed the same at $\widehat{\psi}$ as shown in figure
[1](#fig:untreatedLogRank)

We now provide examples of using the Cox regression model and the
Weibull model in place of the log rank test. To use the Wald test from a
Cox regression model, we specify `test = coxph` in the function
parameters. Covariates can also be included in the estimation procedure
by adding them to the right hand side of the formula. For example,
baseline covariates that are included in the intention-to-treat analysis
may also be incorporated into the estimation procedure of the RPSFTM. In
the following example we add entry time as a covariate and use
`summary()` to find the value of $\widehat{\psi}$ and its 95% CI.

``` r
> rpsftm_fit_cph <- rpsftm(formula = Surv(progyrs, prog) ~ rand(imm, rx) + entry, 
+                          data = immdef,

For the Weibull model we specify `test = survreg` in the function
parameters. :

``` r

As we can see from the output for the Cox and Weibull models, the
estimates of $\psi$ are similar to the estimate obtained from using the
log rank test. Both fitted models could be used as inputs to the
`plot()` function, which produce figures very similar to figure
[1](#fig:untreatedLogRank).

As a sensitivity analysis we can investigate what would happen to the
estimate of $\psi$ if the treatment effect in the deferred treatment
group was half of that in the immediate treatment group by setting
$k_i = 1$ for participants in the latter group and $k_i = 0.5$ for
participants in the former group.

``` r
> weight <- with(immdef, ifelse(imm == 1, 1, 0.5))
> rpsftm(Surv(progyrs, prog) ~ rand(imm, rx), data = immdef, censor_time = censyrs,
+        treat_modifier = weight
+        )
   arm   rx.Min. rx.1st Qu. rx.Median   rx.Mean rx.3rd Qu.   rx.Max.

 Call:
 rpsftm(formula = Surv(progyrs, prog) ~ rand(imm, rx), data = immdef, 
     censor_time = censyrs, treat_modifier = weight)
 
          N Observed Expected (O-E)^2/E (O-E)^2/V
 .arm=0 500      157      157  5.75e-07  1.22e-06
 .arm=1 500      143      143  6.31e-07  1.22e-06
 
  Chisq= 0  on 1 degrees of freedom, p= 0.999 
 
 psi: -0.1704745
 exp(psi): 0.8432646
```

In this case the estimate of treatment effect is reduced slightly to
$-0.170$ and lifetime is used up $0.843$ times as fast when on treatment
as when off treatment.

# Trouble shooting

There is no guarantee that unique solutions exist to the estimating
equations for the estimate and confidence interval limits, or that we
have searched a wide enough interval to find them if they do exist and
are unique.

There are three instances where `rpsftm` will produce warning messages
due to the search interval. The function first evaluates
$Z\left(\psi\right)$ at `low_psi` and `hi_psi` and will produce a
warning message if $Z\left(\psi\right)$ is the same sign at these two
points and no root exists within the interval.

``` r
Warning messages:
1: In rpsftm(formula = Surv(progyrs, prog) ~ rand(imm, rx), data = immdef,  :
  
The starting interval (-1, -0.9) to search for a solution for psi
gives values of the same sign (7.53, 6.88).
Try a wider interval. plot(obj$eval_z, type="s"), where obj is the output of rpsftm()
2: In rpsftm(formula = Surv(progyrs, prog) ~ rand(imm, rx), data = immdef,  :
  Evaluation of the estimated values of psi failed. It is set to NA
3: In rpsftm(formula = Surv(progyrs, prog) ~ rand(imm, rx), data = immdef,  :
  Evaluation of a limit of the Confidence Interval failed.  It is set to NA
4: In rpsftm(formula = Surv(progyrs, prog) ~ rand(imm, rx), data = immdef,  :
  Evaluation of a limit of the Confidence Interval failed.  It is set to NA
```

This suggests widening the search interval via trial and error until a
root for $\psi$ can be found between `low_psi` and `hi_psi`. The second
warning message occurs when `uniroot.all`, the function used to solve
the estimating equation for $\widehat{\psi}$ and its 95% confidence
interval limits, fails to find any one of these. It will set the value
to NA and produce the following warning message

``` r
> rpsftm_fit <- rpsftm(formula = Surv(progyrs, prog) ~ rand(imm, rx),
+                      data = immdef, 
+                      censor_time = censyrs,
+                      low_psi = -1, 
+                      hi_psi = -0.1)
Warning message:
In rpsftm(formula = Surv(progyrs, prog) ~ rand(imm, rx), data = immdef,  :
  Evaluation of a limit of the Confidence Interval failed.  It is set to NA
```

Investigation of a plot of $Z\left(\psi\right)$ against $\psi$ in figure
[2](#fig:zStatisticInterval) for a range of values of $\psi$ could show
why the function fails to find a root. The fitted object, `rpsftm_fit`,
returns a data frame `rpsftm_fit$eval_z` with values of the Z-statistic
evaluated at 100 points between the limits of the search interval. The
data frame can be supplied as the argument to `plot()` to visualise the
estimating equation.

``` r
plot(rpsftm_fit$eval_z, type = "s", ylim = c(-2, 6))
abline(h = qnorm(c(0.025, 0.5, 0.975)))
abline(v = rpsftm_fit$psi)
abline(v = rpsftm_fit$CI)
```

![Figure 2: Plot of $Z\left(\psi\right)$ against $\psi$ to detect
problems with the choice of search
interval](zStatisticInterval.png){#fig:zStatisticInterval width="100%" alt="graphic without alt text"}

In this case, we see that the search interval used was not wide enough
to find the upper confidence limit. The third warning message occurs
when multiple roots are found:

``` r
Warning message:
In root(0) : Multiple Roots found
```

In order to show what happens when multiple roots are found, a subset of
the `immdef` dataset was created and is stored within the test area of
*rpsftm*. Whilst the function `uniroot.all` will return multiple roots,
the function `rpsftm` will only display the first root found by
`uniroot.all`. A plot of $Z\left(\psi\right)$ against $\psi$ can be used
to find the other roots.

The limits of the confidence intervals may not exist at all if
$Z\left(\cdot\right)$ reaches an asymptote before it hits the required
quantile of the standard normal distribution, in which case the limits
should be reported as $\pm \infty$. This scenario would be illustrated
by a similar plot to figure [2](#fig:zStatisticInterval).

Another possibility is for the `coxph` function to fail to converge.
This occurs when the maximum likelihood estimate of a coefficient is
infinity, e.g. if one of the treatment groups has no events. The `coxph`
documentation states that the Wald statistic should be ignored in this
case and therefore the `rpsftm` output should be taken with caution.

# Limitations

As well as the potential computational issues highlighted in the
previous section, the RPSFTM itself has some limitations. The method
relies on the assumption that the treatment effect is the same for all
participants regardless of when treatment is received. We have allowed
for investigation of deviations from this assumption within the
`rpsftm()` function by adding a treatment-effect modifier variable.
Another possible limitation of the model is its requirement for only the
total amount of time spent on/off treatment. In instances where
participants can switch back and forth between treatments the model may
be inefficient.

# Conclusion

The intention is to fill a void in the methodology available to R users
by providing this package and thus facilitate the adoption of newer
methods in application to real data in future. The sensitivity analyses,
which generalise the definition of the counter-factual treatment-free
event times, are an original development.

Further developments to the package may include expanding the
functionality to allow multi-armed studies with three or more arms. Such
an extension would have at its core a set of g-estimating equations to
solve, one for each element of the vector of $\psi$ parameters. Defining
the syntax to capture the multi-dimensional metric of time on treatments
is challenging, as will be the numerical computational details when the
g-estimating equations are step functions.
