title: 'glmperm: A Permutation of Regressor Residuals Test for Inference in Generalized
  Linear Models'
abstract: We introduce a new R package called glmperm for inference in generalized
  linear models especially for small and moderate-sized data sets. The inference is
  based on the permutation of regressor residuals test introduced by Potter (2005).
  The implementation of glmperm outperforms currently available permutation test software
  as glmperm can be applied in situations where more than one covariate is involved.
