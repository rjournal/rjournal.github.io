title: 'Pstat: An R Package to Assess Population Differentiation in Phenotypic Traits'
abstract: The package Pstat calculates PST values to assess differentiation among
  populations from a set of quantitative traits and provides bootstrapped distributions
  and confidence intervals for PST . Variations of PST as a function of the parameter
  c/h2 are studied as well. The package implements different transformations of the
  measured phenotypic traits to eliminate variation resulting from allometric growth,
  including calculation of residuals from linear regression, Reist standardization,
  and the Aitchison transformation.
