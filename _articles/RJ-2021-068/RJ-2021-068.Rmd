title: 'BayesSPsurv: An R Package to Estimate Bayesian (Spatial) Split-Population
  Survival Models'
abstract: Survival data often include a fraction of units that are susceptible to
  an event of interest as well as a fraction of "immune" units. In many applications,
  spatial clustering in unobserved risk factors across nearby units can also affect
  their survival rates and odds of becoming immune. To address these methodological
  challenges, this article introduces our [BayesSPsurv](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=BayesSPsurv)
  R-package, which fits parametric Bayesian Spatial split-population survival (cure)
  models that can account for spatial autocorrelation in both subpopulations of the
  user's time-to-event data. Spatial autocorrelation is modeled with spatially weighted
  frailties, which are estimated using a conditionally autoregressive prior. The user
  can also fit parametric cure models with or without nonspatial i.i.d. frailties,
  and each model can incorporate time-varying covariates. BayesSPsurv also includes
  various functions to conduct pre-estimation spatial autocorrelation tests, visualize
  results, and assess model performance, all of which are illustrated using data on
  post-civil war peace survival.

# Introduction

Conventional survival models have been applied to analyze time-to-event
data across several academic disciplines, but these models rely on two
core assumptions that are not always tenable. The first is that all
units, including right-censored observations, will eventually experience
the event of interest. In many applications, however, some fraction of
subjects that are "immune" or "cured" may never experience the event
[@maller1996survival; @peng2014cure; @beger2017splitting]. A clinical
study of obesity on human death rates can employ a standard survival
model because all subjects will eventually die, but a study on vaccine
effectiveness will likely assume that some fraction of the treated
population will become immune while others may respond differently and
remain uncured. To account for both subpopulations, scholars have
developed a class of split-population (SP) survival models that
probabilistically separate the immune fraction from the units that are
susceptible to the event of interest and then estimate the conditional
hazard of survival among the latter units
[@smcure-package; @spduration-pkg; @box1999modeling; @boxsteffbook]. The
second assumption of conventional survival models is that each
observation is conditionally independent after controlling for
covariates. This assumption is violated if spatially clustered units
share common unobserved features that influence their baseline risk of
experiencing an event [@darmofal2009bayesian; @taylor2017spatsurv]. If
spatial autocorrelation matters for process survival and/or the
probability of being immune to an event, ignoring it can lead to biased
parameter estimates.

Although there are numerous methods for dealing with spatially
autocorrelated time-to-event data (e.g.,
[@li2002modeling; @banerjee2003frailty; @henderson2002modeling; @spBayesSurv-article]),
these spatial survival models do not differentiate between at-risk and
immune observations. Conversely, existing SP survival models either
ignore spatial autocorrelation altogether or only account for it in the
survival stage [@banerjee2004parametric]. We present the BayesSPsurv
[@BayesSPsurv] R-package (available at
<https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=BayesSPsurv>), which has the power
to overcome these limitations as well as the flexibility for researchers
to model spatial clustering in their survival data however they choose
to define it. In particular, BayesSPsurv allows the user to estimate
parametric Bayesian Spatial split-population survival (cure) models with
spatial frailties in both the model's split and survival stages. These
models account for spatial clustering in the immune and at-risk
fractions of the data. The package also includes functions and code for
pre-estimation spatial autocorrelation diagnostics, visualizing results,
simulating multiple Markov chains, and implementing Markov Chain Monte
Carlo (MCMC) estimation routines for SP survival models with independent
(exchangeable) or no random effects. The user can also include
time-varying covariates in either stage. In the next section, we outline
previous work on SP and spatial survival models, including existing
packages and their limitations. We then formally develop the Pooled,
Exchangeable, and Spatial Bayesian SP survival models before describing
the various functions available in the BayesSPsurv package. We
demonstrate these functions using replication data from a published
study on the survival of post-civil war peace.

# Background and other R-packages

Scholars have identified at least two sources of conditional
heterogeneity in survival data that hasve been separately addressed. The
first occurs when a subset of the units in the data are immune from
experiencing a "failure" event, which violates the assumption that even
right-censored observations experience the event of interest
[@box1999modeling; @boxsteffbook; @beger2017splitting]. Cure rate or
split-population (SP) survival models account for this immune fraction
by first estimating the probability that right-censored units are immune
from an event in a "split-stage" and then the time until *at-risk*
censored and non-censored units experience the event. Recent work has
extended these models to include i.i.d. frailties [@peng2011mixture],
time-varying covariates [@beger2017splitting], and account for random
right-censoring [@patilea2020general]. Split-population survival models
have been used to study phenomena, ranging from the survival of breast
cancer patients [@wang2005gene], criminal recidivism
[@schmidt1989predicting], the risk of coups [@beger2017splitting], and
parasite-induced mortality in river salmon [@ray2014using].

Separately, conventional survival models have been extended to account
for spatial autocorrelation among nearby units
[@banerjee2003frailty; @taylor2017spatsurv; @spBayesSurv-article]. These
models relax the assumption of spatial independence by incorporating
spatially weighted frailties into the survival model's baseline hazard
function. This allows for the possibility that adjacent units share
unmodeled risk factors that influence their underlying propensities for
experiencing a failure event. Apart from recent advances in modeling
spatial frailties in different survival frameworks (e.g.
[@diva2008parametric; @spBayesSurv-article]), spatial survival models
have been applied to analyze, for example, geographically referenced
data on leukemia survival [@henderson2002modeling], position
announcements by U.S. House members [@darmofal2009bayesian], prostate
cancer [@spBayesSurv-article], and fire service response times
[@taylor2017spatsurv]. Despite these considerable methodological
developments, far less attention has been dedicated to accounting for
spatial autocorrelation in SP survival settings. This is surprising
because spatial autocorrelation between units may influence their
probability of being immune and the survival rate among the units at
risk of experiencing the failure event simultaneously.
@banerjee2004parametric develop Bayesian spatial cure models but focus
on modeling spatial autocorrelation in the survival stage using a
conditionally autoregressive (CAR) prior. In fact, these authors
emphasize that future research must "include covariates and spatial
random effects as regressors in the cure rate portion of the model,
instead of just the log-relative risk portion" (274).

In line with these trends in the literature, some R packages fit
standard and split-population survival models but do not allow for the
incorporation of spatial information. The
[survival](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=survival) package
[@survival-package] fits parametric and semiparametric Cox survival
models via MLE, whereas
[dynsurv](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=dynsurv) [@dynsurv] fits
the Cox Proportional Hazards (PH) model with dynamic coefficients using
MCMC methods. Conventional semi-parametric cure models can be estimated
via MLE with the [smcure](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=smcure)
[@smcure-package] or [nltm](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=nltm)
[@nltm] package. The
[flexsurvcure](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=flexsurvcure)
[@flexsurvcure] package fits parametric mixture and non-mixture cure
models for time-to-event data, and the
[spduration](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=spduration) package fits
parametric SP survival models with time-varying covariates
[@spduration-pkg].

A small handful of packages allow the user to incorporate spatial
information into their survival models, but *never* in split-population
settings. The [BayesX](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=BayesX)
package [@BayesX] and its associated interface to R
[R2BayesX](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=R2BayesX) [@R2BayesX-pkg]
fit spatial survival models and structured additive regression models
with spatial frailties. The
[spBayesSurv](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=spBayesSurv) package
[@spBayesSurv-pkg] fits several Bayesian survival models with spatial
frailties that can be formulated on a PH, proportional odds, or AFT
scale, all of which can include time-varying covariates. The
[spatsurv](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=spatsurv) package also
fits Bayesian spatial survival models, including a PH model that permits
users to incorporate Gaussian process frailties [@spatsurv-pkg]. Beyond
R, WinBUGS and GeoBUGs code has been developed to fit, for instance,
survival and non-mixture cure models with spatial frailties
[@banerjee2003frailty; @banerjee2004spatial; @thomas2004geobugs].

To our knowledge, our
[BayesSPsurv](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=BayesSPsurv) package is
the first to allow users to fit parametric split-population survival
models with not just time-varying covariates but also spatial frailties
in both stages. The frailties in the parametric Bayesian spatial SP
model are estimated using the CAR prior approach
[@besag1991bayesian; @bernardinelli1995bayesian; @banerjee2003frailty; @banerjee2004parametric].
BayesSPsurv also includes functions and routines coded in C++ to fit
nonspatial parametric SP survival models with exchangeable frailties in
the model's split and survival-stage equation and without any frailties.
Statistical inference of the models in BayesSPsurv is conducted via
combined MCMC techniques that require little input from users. Our
package and supplemental code also provide functions to implement
spatial autocorrelation tests, produce country-level adjacency matrices,
generate and compare multiple Markov chains, assess convergence, and
conduct model comparison. Before outlining the functionality of the
package in greater detail, we turn to briefly develop each of the three
included Bayesian split-population survival models.

# The Bayesian (*Spatial*) split-population survival model

## Model development

Define $i=\{1,2,...N\}$ for the units that may fail or experience an
event of interest in a continuous-time survival dataset. Let $f(t)$ and
$F(t)$ represent the probability density function and cumulative
distribution function. The survival distribution is $S(t)=1-F(t)$, and
the hazard rate is $h(t)=\frac{f(t)}{S(t)}$. Some units will fail during
the time period under observation $(\widetilde{C}_{i}=1)$, while others
do not and are "censored"  $(\widetilde{C}_{i}=0)$. The general
likelihood of the conventional survival model in which all units
eventually experience the event of interest is

$${\textstyle\prod\limits_{i=1}^{N}}
\left[f\left(t_{i}\right)\right]^{\widetilde{C}_{i}}\left[S\left(t\right)\right]^{1-\widetilde{C}_{i}}.%$$

Suppose that the survival data includes two subpopulations: an "at-risk
" fraction that can fail and an "immune" fraction that will *not*
experience the (failure) event of interest
[@maller1996survival; @yin2005cure; @beger2017splitting]. When presented
with this data generation process, researchers typically employ
split-population survival (cure) models with or without unit-specific
frailties to simultaneously estimate the probability of observations
being in the immune fraction and the effect of covariates on the hazard
of survival among the at-risk fraction
[@maller1996survival; @lu2010; @peng2014cure].

To understand these models in more detail, consider the split-population
survival model for the duration $t$ that splits the sample into an
at-risk and an immune fraction. Let $\alpha_{i}=Pr(Y_{i}=1)$ be the
probability with which units enter the immune fraction. $\alpha_{i}$ can
be estimated via a binary response function and is defined for the logit
case as:

$$\alpha_{i}=\frac{\exp\left(\mathbf{Z}_{i}\boldsymbol{\gamma}+V_{i}\right)}{1+\exp
\left(\mathbf{Z}_{i}\boldsymbol{\gamma}+V_{i}\right)},$$

where $\mathbf{Z}_{i}$ are p2-dimensional covariates,
$\boldsymbol{\gamma
}$  the parameter vector in $\mathbb{R}^{p_{2}}$, and
$V_{i}\sim N(0,\sigma^{2})$ are the nonspatial i.i.d unit-specific
frailties (random effects). Equation 2 is the split-population model's
split-stage equation, where the unit-specific frailties $V_{i}$, which
are each independent of other individual random effects, account for
unobserved heterogeneity that influences probability $\alpha_{i}$. Let
$W_{i}\sim
N(0,\sigma^{2})$ denote the nonspatial i.i.d unit-specific frailties
that capture the possibility that some units are at different risks of
experiencing the event of interest due to unobserved factors. The
proportional hazards function of the SP survival model with nonspatial,
unit-specific frailties is

$$h\left(t_{i}|\mathbf{X}_{i}\boldsymbol{\beta},W_{i}\right)=h_{0}\left(t_{i}\right)\omega_{i}%
\exp\left(\mathbf{X}_{i}\boldsymbol{\beta}\right)=h_{0}\left(t_{i}\right)\exp\left(\mathbf{X}%
_{i}\boldsymbol{\beta}+W_{i}\right),$$

where $h_{0}(t_{i})$ is the baseline hazard (e.g., Weibull,
log-logistic), $\log\omega_{i}=W_{i}$, $\mathbf{X}_{i}$ is the
p1-dimensional covariates, and $\boldsymbol{\beta}$ the parameter vector
in $\mathbb{R}^{p_{1}}$. We focus on incorporating unit-specific frailty
terms generally because they are most commonly used in the social
sciences. However, our approach could plausibly be extended to a shared
frailty framework if the researcher believes that the frailties occur in
clusters such that within-cluster frailties are correlated while
frailties between clusters are independent.

Suppose, however, that the survival data with the two aforementioned
subpopulations should be fit with time-varying covariates. We can
re-define this data with unique "entry time" duration as $t0$ and "exit
time" as duration $t$ for each period at which an observation is
observed. Let $t0_{ij}$ denote unit $i$'s elapsed time since inception
until the beginning of time period $j$, $t_{ij}$ the elapsed time since
that unit's inception until the end of period $j$, and $\tilde{C}%
_{ij}=1$ if that unit fails or is censored ($\tilde{C}_{ij}=0$) at
$t_{ij}$. The probability of survival up until period $j$ is now
$S(t0)=1-F(t0)$ where $F\left(t0\right)=\int_{0}^{t0}f\left(t0\right)$.
In this case, both subpopulations contribute to the log-likelihood of
the split-population survival model with nonspatial i.i.d frailties as:

$$\resizebox{0.94\hsize}{!}{$
\ln L=\sum_{i=1}^{N}\left\{  \widetilde{C}_{ij}\ln \left[
\left(1-\alpha_{ij}\right)\frac{f\left(t_{ij}|\mathbf{X}_{ij}\boldsymbol{\beta},W_{i}%
\right)}{S\left(t0_{ij}|\mathbf{X}_{ij}\boldsymbol{\beta},W_{i}\right)}\right]
+\left(1-\widetilde{C}_{ij}\right)\ln \left[  \alpha_{i}+\left(1-\alpha_{i}%
\right)\frac{S\left(t_{ij}|\mathbf{X}_{ij}\boldsymbol{\beta},W_{i}\right)}{S\left(t0_{ij}%
|\mathbf{X}_{ij}\boldsymbol{\beta},W_{i}\right)}\right]  \right\}$
},$$

where the "split-stage" equation is
$\alpha_{ij}=\frac{\exp\left(\mathbf{Z}_{ij}\boldsymbol{\gamma}\text{ }+V_{i}%
\right)}{1+\exp\left(\mathbf{Z}_{ij}\boldsymbol{\gamma}\text{ }\boldsymbol{+}V_{i}\right)}$.
$V_{i}$ and $W_{i}$ are the nonspatial frailties. The model's survival
stage estimates the probability of survival prior to the event of
interest conditional upon being at-risk for that event given covariates
$\mathbf{X}%
_{ij}$ and the baseline hazard function. If $V_{i}=W_{i}=0$, then (4)
defines the log-likelihood of the \"Pooled\" SP survival model
(*without* unit-specific frailties) with time-varying covariates
[@ibrahim2001bayesian; @lu2010]. However, if unobserved unit-specific
heterogeneity influences the probability of immunity or survival time,
it can be accounted for with the split and survival-stage frailty terms
($V_{i}$ and $W_{i}$). In a Bayesian split-population survival
framework, these frailties are incorporated into each stage of the model
using the exchangeable normal prior,

$$W_{i}\sim N\left(0,1/\tau\right)\text{ and }V_{i}\sim N\left(0,1/\tau\right)\text{ },%$$

with $\tau$ as the precision parameter
[@banerjee2003frailty; @banerjee2004parametric]. The prior in (5) is
induced by treating each specified unit as exchangeable rather than
assigning weights corresponding to each unit's spatial relationship to
one another [@bernardinelli1992; @darmofal2009bayesian]. This
Exchangeable split-population survival model is appropriate if each
unit's frailty is presumed to be independent of other individual random
effects. Geographically, for instance, this means that the influence of
each unit-specific frailty on that unit's probability of being immune or
its risk propensity is completely unrelated to the neighboring units'
frailties unobserved effects.

Suppose, however, that independence among the frailties *cannot* be
assumed---that is, that the frailties exhibit spatial autocorrelation or
clustering that influences each units' propensity for being immune to an
event of interest and their survival time if they are not immune. In a
Bayesian split-population survival model, the assumption of spatial
independence is relaxed by assigning spatial weights to the
unit-specific frailties in the model's split and survival stage and then
statistically incorporating these spatially weighted frailties via the
conditionally autoregressive (CAR) prior approach
[@besag1991bayesian; @banerjee2003frailty]. The CAR prior accounts for
spatially autocorrelated frailties by allowing the frailties to be
spatially autocorrelated across geographically adjacent units.

To understand how the CAR prior is applied, first note that spatial data
often take the form of a lattice in which a continuous spatial surface
is divided into a grid of units such as counties, districts, or
countries. The spatially weighted frailties are constructed by defining
the relevant spatial relationship among adjacent units (this could, for
example, be geographic distance or contiguity) in an adjacency matrix
$\mathbf{A}$ with elements $a_{ii^{\prime}}$. Each element
$a_{ii^{\prime}}$ in $\mathbf{A}$ is given a weight of 1 if units $i$
and $i^{\prime}$ are "neighbors," and 0 if they are not. Once these
spatial weights are defined via the matrix $\mathbf{A}$, this
information is then incorporated into the CAR prior, which permits us to
model spatially dependent frailties between these contiguous units. To
employ the CAR prior approach in a Bayesian SP survival framework, the
frailties $V_{i}$ are collected into the vector $\mathbf{V=\{}V_{1}%
,....,V_{N}\}$, and $W_{i}$ into $\mathbf{W=\{}W_{1}$*,\....,*$W_{N}\}$.
Separate CAR priors are then employed for $\mathbf{V}$ and $\mathbf{W}$,
which implies the following model structure:

$$\mathbf{V|}\lambda\sim\text{CAR}\left(\lambda\right)\text{ and }\mathbf{W|}\lambda
\sim\text{CAR}\left(\lambda\right).$$

$\lambda$ is the precision parameter
[@besag1991bayesian; @banerjee2004parametric]. The CAR$(\lambda)$ prior
for $\mathbf{V}$ and $\mathbf{W}$ has a joint distribution in each case
that has been formally characterized by scholars [@banerjee2003frailty
126].

The resulting conditional distributions of the spatial frailties for
$\mathbf{V}$ and $\mathbf{W}$ are

$$V_{i}|V_{i^{\prime}\neq i}\text{ }\sim\text{ }N\left(\overline{V_{i}},1/\left(\lambda
m_{i}\right)\right),\text{ \ \ }W_{i}|W_{i^{\prime}\neq i}\text{ }\sim\text{ }
N\left(\overline{W_{i}},1/\left(\lambda m_{i}\right)\right).$$

$\overline{W_{i}}=m_{i}^{-1}\sum_{i^{\prime}\text{ }adj\text{ }%
i}W_{i^{\prime}}$ and $\overline{V_{i}}=m_{i}^{-1}\sum_{i^{\prime}\text{
}adj\text{ }i}V_{i^{\prime}}$. $\overline{W}_{i}$ and $\overline{V_{i}}$
are the averages of the neighboring $W_{i^{^{\prime}}\neq i}$ and
$V_{i^{^{\prime
}}\neq i}$, respectively, where $i^{\prime}$ $adj$ $i$ denotes that
$i^{\prime}$ is adjacent to $i$ given $\mathbf{A}$, and $m_{i}$ is the
number of these adjacencies ([@bernardinelli1992 989];
[@thomas2004geobugs; @banerjee2003frailty]). Incorporating the spatial
information in $\mathbf{A}$ in this way accounts for the possibility
that spatially proximate units share common unmodeled factors that
influence their probability of being immune or their survival time
before experiencing the event of interest. Using this CAR prior approach
to address spatial autocorrelation, the Spatial split-population
survival model's log-likelihood is defined by substituting
$\mathbf{V=}\left\{  V_{i}\right\}$ and $\mathbf{W=}\left\{
W_{i}\right\}$  in equation 4 (where $\alpha_{ij}=\frac{\exp
\left(\mathbf{Z}_{ij}\boldsymbol{\gamma}\text{ },\mathbf{V}\right)}{1+\exp\left(\mathbf{Z}%
_{ij}\boldsymbol{\gamma}\text{ }\boldsymbol{,}\mathbf{V}\right)}$ is the
split-stage equation).

The log-likelihood of the Pooled (non-frailty), Exchangeable (nonspatial
frailty), and Spatial split-population (SP) survival models are
compatible with any survival distribution. The BayesSPsurv package,
however, supports MCMC estimation of these models for the Weibull and
log-logistic distributions. Our empirical application below focuses on
the Weibull survival distribution. The density, survival, and hazard
rate in the Weibull case are $$\begin{gathered}
f\left(t_{ij}|\rho,\theta\right)=\rho\theta\left(\theta t_{ij}\right)^{\rho-1}\exp\left(-\left(\theta
t_{ij}\right)^{\rho}\right)\\
S\left(t_{ij}|\rho,\theta\right)=\exp\left(-\left(\theta t_{ij}\right)^{\rho}\right)\text{ and }h\left(t_{ij}
|\rho,\theta\right)=\rho\theta\left(\theta t_{ij}\right)^{\rho-1},
\end{gathered}$$ where
$\theta=\exp\left(\mathbf{X}_{ij}\boldsymbol{\beta},\mathbf{W}\right)$
for the Spatial,
$\theta=\exp\left(\mathbf{X}_{ij}\boldsymbol{\beta}+W_{i}\right)$ for
the Exchangeable, and
$\theta=\exp\left(\mathbf{X}_{ij}\boldsymbol{\beta}\right)$ for the
Pooled split-population Weibull model. The density, survival function
and the hazard rate for the log-logistic case is defined in @Bolte2021.

## Bayesian inference

Following standard practice for Bayesian inference [@carlin2000], we
assign the multivariate normal (MVN) prior to $\boldsymbol{\beta
}=\{\beta_{1},...,\beta_{p_{1}}\}$ and $\boldsymbol{\gamma}=\{\gamma
_{1},...,\gamma_{p_{2}}\}$, and the Gamma prior for $\rho$ with shape
and scale parameters $a_{\rho}$ and $b_{\rho}$ for *each* of the three
Bayesian split-population survival models in the BayesSPsurv package.
$$\begin{split} 
\rho\text{ } &  \sim\text{Gamma}\left(a_{\rho},b_{\rho}\right),\text{ \ \ \ }%
\boldsymbol{\beta}\sim\mbox{MVN}_{p_{1}}\left(\mu_{\beta},\Sigma_{\beta}\right),\text{
\ \ \ }\boldsymbol{\gamma}\sim\mbox{MVN}_{p_{2}} \left(\mu_{\gamma},\Sigma_{\gamma
}\right)\\
&  \text{ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ }\Sigma
_{\beta\text{ }}\sim\text{IW}\left(S_{\beta},\nu_{\beta}\right)\text{;\ \ }\Sigma
_{\gamma\text{ }}\sim\text{IW}\left(S_{\gamma},\nu_{\gamma}\right),
\end{split}$$

where $a_{\rho}$, $b_{\rho}$, $S_{\beta}$, $\nu_{\beta},\ S_{\gamma
}$, $\nu_{\gamma}$ are the hyperparameters. We use Bayesian hierarchical
modeling to estimate $\Sigma_{\beta}$ and $\Sigma_{\gamma}$ employing
the Inverse-Wishart ($\mbox{IW}$) distribution when using the MVN (a
weakly informative) prior. For Bayesian MCMC estimation of the
Spatial SP survival (Weibull) model, we assign the hyperprior
$p(\lambda)$ to $\lambda$ given the CAR prior approach. Specifically, we
assign the Gamma hyperprior
$\lambda\sim\mbox{Gamma}(a_{\lambda},b_{\lambda})$ for $\lambda$
[@banerjee2004parametric; @darmofal2009bayesian].[^1] To estimate the
Exchangeable SP Weibull model, we assign the (multivariate) normal prior
for the model's split and survival-stage frailties
$\left(V_{i},W_{i}\right)$, and the priors defined in (9) for
$\boldsymbol{\beta}$, $\boldsymbol{\gamma}$,and $\rho$. To identify the
Exchangeable and Spatial SP models' intercepts, we impose the constraint
that the frailties sum to zero ($\sum_{i}V_{i}=0$ and
$\sum_{i}W_{i}=0$).

The joint posterior distribution of the Bayesian Spatial SP survival
model with time-varying covariates---our main model of interest---is
$$\resizebox{0.93\hsize}{!}{$
\begin{aligned}
\pi\left(\boldsymbol{\beta},\boldsymbol{\gamma},\rho,\mathbf{W},\mathbf{V}
,\lambda,\Sigma_{\beta},\Sigma_{\gamma}|  \mathbf{C},\mathbf{X}
,\mathbf{Z},\mathbf{t},\mathbf{t0},\boldsymbol{\gamma}\right)& \quad\mathit{\propto
}\quad L \left(\boldsymbol{\beta},\boldsymbol{\gamma},\rho,\mathbf{W},\mathbf{V}
|\mathbf{C},\mathbf{X},\mathbf{Z},\mathbf{t,t0}\right)\\
 \pi\left(\mathbf{W}|\lambda\right)\pi\left(\mathbf{V}|\lambda\right)&\pi\left({\beta}|\mu_{\beta
},\Sigma_{\beta}\right)\pi\left({\gamma}|\mu_{\gamma},\Sigma_{\gamma}\right)\pi\left(\rho
\right)\pi\left(\lambda\right)\pi\left(\Sigma_{\beta}\right)\pi\left(\Sigma_{\gamma}\right),
\end{aligned}$}$$

where $L\left(\boldsymbol{\beta},\boldsymbol{\gamma}%
,\rho,\mathbf{W},\mathbf{V}|\mathbf{C},\mathbf{X},\mathbf{Z},\mathbf{t,t0}\right)$
is defined in (4) with $\mathbf{V=\{}%
V_{1},....,V_{N}\}$ and $\mathbf{W=\{}W_{1}$*,\....,* $W_{N}\}$. The
density, survival function, and hazard rate for this likelihood is given
by the Weibull (or log-logistic) distribution in our R-package.
$\pi\left(\mathbf{W}|\lambda\right)$ and $\pi\left(\mathbf{V}%
|\lambda\right)$ are defined via their respective conditional
distributions in (7).
$\pi\left({\beta}|\mu_{\beta},\Sigma_{\beta}\right)$,
$\pi\left({\gamma}|\mu_{\gamma}%
,\Sigma_{\gamma}\right)$, and $\pi\left(\rho\right)$ are from (9),
$\pi\left(\Sigma_{\beta}\right)$ and $\pi\left(\Sigma_{\gamma}\right)$
are from (10). $\pi\left(\lambda\right)$ is the Gamma hyperprior for the
Spatial SP survival model. From (10), we can define the joint posterior
distribution of the time-varying (i) Exchangeable SP survival model by
incorporating the frailties $V_{i}$ and $W_{i}$ (instead of
$\mathbf{W}$, $\mathbf{V}$, and their CAR priors) given by (5) and (ii)
Pooled SP survival model by excluding frailty terms.

The three split-population survival models in BayesSPsurv are each
estimated with an MCMC algorithm for Bayesian inference. Because
closed-forms for the posterior distributions of
$\boldsymbol{\beta,\gamma}$ and $\rho$ are not available, these
parameters in each model are updated in the MCMC algorithm via
slice-sampling (with stepout and shrinkage) from their respective full
conditional distribution. The closed form of the full conditional
distributions (e.g., $\pi\left(\Sigma_{\beta}|{\beta}\right)$ and
$\pi\left(\Sigma_{\gamma}|{\gamma}\right)$) and details about
slice-sampling is provided in @Bolte2021.[^2] Further, because the
closed-forms for the posterior distributions of $\lambda,\mathbf{W}$,
and $\mathbf{V}$ are not available for the Spatial split-population
survival model, our MCMC algorithm incorporates Gibbs Sampling for
estimating $\lambda$. Our MCMC update scheme then employs the
Metropolis-Hastings algorithm for estimating $\mathbf{V}$ given
$\lambda$ and then uses the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm to estimate
$\mathbf{W}$ given $\lambda$.[^3] In the Exchangeable SP survival model,
the nonspatial i.i.d frailties $V_{i}$ and $W_{i}$ are updated via
Metropolis-Hastings, while the Pooled SP model excludes frailty terms.
The MCMC update scheme to fit each model in BayesSPsurv are described in
detail in @Bolte2021.

# Using the BayesSPsurv R package

Each of the three Bayesian SP survival models in BayesSPsurv
incorporates a cure rate fraction and assumes that the time-to-event
baseline hazard follows a Weibull or log-logistic distribution (which
the user specifies). Users can also incorporate time-varying covariates
in either stage. BayesSPsurv contains compiled C++ code using the
package [Rcpp](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=Rcpp) [@Rcpp-pkg] to
maximize computational efficiency when estimating the included Bayesian
SP survival models. In addition to the pre-estimation spatial
autocorrelation (Join Count and Global Moran's I) tests described below,
the BayesSPsurv package also permits users to calculate the deviance
information criterion (DIC) and log-likelihood statistics from the
Spatial, Exchangeable, and Pooled SP survival models' MCMC output. The
DIC is a measure of model fit that also penalizes the effective number
of parameters. Like the Akaike Information Criterion, models with
smaller values are preferable to those with larger values. Users can
also conduct MCMC diagnostics with various extant packages designed to
handle mcmc objects such as
[coda](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=coda) [@coda-manual].

## Loading the package, dataset, and assessing spatial autocorrelation

To demonstrate the utility and various functions in
[BayesSPsurv](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=BayesSPsurv), we use
replication data from @walter2015bad's ([-@walter2015bad]) global study
on post-civil war peace duration (denoted in the package as
Walter_2015_JCR). @walter2015bad's ([-@walter2015bad]) panel data
consist of 1,237 observations from 46 countries observed between 1962
and 2009. As discussed in @Bolte2021, her data are well-suited for SP
survival analysis because they include two underlying populations: an
"at-risk" fraction of countries in which civil wars can potentially
recur, and an "immune" fraction of countries in which civil conflict
recurrence is structurally improbable. The Walter_2015_JCR data are a
subset of @walter2015bad's ([-@walter2015bad]) most important variables,
including lgdpl for log per capita income, unpko for the presence of UN
peacekeeping operations, the binary variable victory, coded as 1 when
one side in the civil war wins the conflict militarily, and the dummy
variable comprehensive, coded as 1 when the combatants sign a
comprehensive peace agreement. The dataset also includes the binary
indicator renewed_war, coded as 1 for the year in which a civil war
recurs and 0 otherwise. This variable will serve as our failure event.

First, however, we load the BayesSPsurv package along with the dataset
and then use the add_duration() function from the
[spduration](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=spduration) package to
add several variables that allow us to capture the survival
characteristics of the data [@beger2017splitting]. unitID indicates the
unique unit identifier (in this case, a unique id for each civil
conflict), and timeID specifies the temporal variable.

::: example
library(BayesSPsurv) data(Walter_2015_JCR) walter \<-
spduration::add_duration(Walter_2015_JCR,\"renewed_war\", unitID =
\"id\", tID = \"year\", freq = \"year\", ongoing = FALSE) str(walter)

3 4 5 6 \... $t.0          : num  0 1 2 3 0 1 2 3 4 5 ...
\end{example}

\noindent These new variables include \texorpdfstring%
{{\normalfont\ttfamily\hyphenchar\font=-1 duration}}%
{duration}, a cumulative count of the years of post-war peace survived, and the dummy variable \texorpdfstring%
{{\normalfont\ttfamily\hyphenchar\font=-1 atrisk}}%
{atrisk}, coded as 1 for all observations that eventually experience war recurrence in the sample period. Altogether the data include 77 post-civil war peace spells and 24 instances of civil war recurrence. 

If the preferred frailty unit is at the country-level, users can take advantage of the \texorpdfstring%
{{\normalfont\ttfamily\hyphenchar\font=-1 spatial\_SA()}}%
{spatial\_SA()} function in the \texorpdfstring%
{{\normalfont\fontseries{b}\selectfont BayesSPsurv}}%
{BayesSPsurv} package to generate their binary spatial weights matrix. In most cases, analysts define spatial clustering in terms of geographic proximity. This often requires the researcher to define some maximum distance threshold below which two units are considered ``neighbors.'' \texorpdfstring%
{{\normalfont\ttfamily\hyphenchar\font=-1 spatial\_SA()}}%
{spatial\_SA()} allows users to specify their own distance threshold. For this example, we use the \texorpdfstring%
{{\normalfont\ttfamily\hyphenchar\font=-1 spatial\_SA()}}%
{spatial\_SA()} function to generate an adjacency matrix of countries in the data whereby “proximity” ($a\_ii'
=
1$) is defined as having capitals that are within 800 km of each other (and$a\_ii'
=
0$otherwise). We simply specify the unique identifier for each country (\texorpdfstring%
{{\normalfont\ttfamily\hyphenchar\font=-1 ccode}}%
{ccode}) and our distance threshold of 800 km. The \texorpdfstring%
{{\normalfont\ttfamily\hyphenchar\font=-1 spatial\_SA()}}%
{spatial\_SA()} function will produce a$`<!-- -->`{=html}1
N$vector with identifying information (e.g., country ID) for each observation that matches the  rows and columns of the matrix. The result is a list object called \texorpdfstring%
{{\normalfont\ttfamily\hyphenchar\font=-1 walter}}%
{walter} that includes both the original data frame and the associated adjacency matrix.

\begin{example}
walter <- BayesSPsurv::spatial_SA(data = walter, var_ccode = "ccode",                                                threshold = 800L)
walter[[2]][1:6,1:6]
  
        42  90  92  93  135  155 
    42  0   0   0   0    0    0     
    90  0   0   1   1    0    0     
    92  0   1   0   1    0    0     
    93  0   1   1   0    0    0     
    135 0   0   0   0    0    0     
    155 0   0   0   0    0    0     
\end{example}


\noindent Note that spatial adjacency between units does not need to be defined geographically; users can conceptualize “space” as any form of the dyadic relationship between units, but typically spatial clustering is substantively captured with some measure of geographic distance. Users can also create their own adjacency matrix from scratch to incorporate into the Bayesian estimation routine if their units of analysis are something other than countries.


Having generated a matrix that records the spatial relationship of all pairs of units, we may now be interested in assessing the presence and degree of spatial autocorrelation in the data with respect to our outcomes of interest. The \texorpdfstring%
{{\normalfont\fontseries{b}\selectfont BayesSPsurv}}%
{BayesSPsurv} package provides two functions to conduct these preliminary tests on country-level data. The first is the \texorpdfstring%
{{\normalfont\ttfamily\hyphenchar\font=-1 plot\_JoinCount()}}%
{plot\_JoinCount()} function, which generates an adjacency matrix with a user-defined distance threshold (as above), implements the join count test for each cross-section in the data, and then automatically plots the test statistics with user-specified confidence intervals across each observed year. The join count test is a widely used correlational statistic for evaluating whether the expected count of categorically distinct adjacent units is greater than what we would expect by chance alone \citep{cliff1981spatial}. More formally, if we assume two categories, Black and White, then the join count test statistic is

\begin{equation}
Z\left(BW\right) = \frac{BW-E \left( BW \right) }{\sqrt{\sigma^2_{BW}}},
\end{equation}

\noindent where BW and E$(BW)$are the observed and expected counts of adjacent Black and White units, respectively, and$\^2\_BW=
E(BW\^2) -
E(BW)\^2$. We use this test as a preliminary exercise to determine whether countries that \emph{never} experience conflict recurrence in the sample exhibit spatial autocorrelation. Note that \texorpdfstring%
{{\normalfont\ttfamily\hyphenchar\font=-1 plot\_JoinCount}}%
{plot\_JoinCount} also has an argument specifying the minimum number of units that must be in a cross-section for the test statistic to be calculated. In our case, there were fewer than 12 countries in every year prior to 1975 in the data, and none were geographically proximate. By specifying \texorpdfstring%
{{\normalfont\ttfamily\hyphenchar\font=-1 n=12}}%
{n=12}, we are simply dropping years prior to 1975. The following code produces the plot in Figure \ref{fig: joint count}.

\begin{example}
plot_JoinCount(data = walter[[1]], var_cured = "cured", var_id = "ccode", 
                var_time = "year", n = 12)
\end{example}

%Figure 1
\begin{figure}[!htb]
     \centering
     \begin{subfigure}[b]{0.487\textwidth}
         \centering
         \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{figures/JCnew.pdf}
         \caption{Join Count}

     \hfill
     \caption{Pre-estimation Spatial Autocorrelation Tests}
        \label{figure1: pre-estimation tests}
\end{figure}


\noindent Negative values indicate clustering (positive spatial autocorrelation), and positive values indicate spatial dispersion. Figure \ref{fig: joint count} clearly depicts spatially correlated patterns of potential “peace consolidation,” though the direction of the autocorrelation varies over time.

The second function, \texorpdfstring%
{{\normalfont\ttfamily\hyphenchar\font=-1 plot\_Moran.I()}}%
{plot\_Moran.I()}, implements the Global Moran’s I test, which assesses the direction and degree of spatial autocorrelation in continuous or ordinal data \citep{moran1950notes,ape}. We use this test to examine whether the duration of post-civil war peace among geographically proximate countries exhibits spatial autocorrelation (or dispersion). Like the previous function, \texorpdfstring%
{{\normalfont\ttfamily\hyphenchar\font=-1 plot\_Moran.I()}}%
{plot\_Moran.I()} plots the Moran’s I values based on user-defined adjacencies and, in this case, 90\% confidence intervals for each year. 

\begin{example}
plot_Moran.I(data = walter[[1]], var_duration = "duration", var_id = "ccode",
            var_time = "year", n = 12)
\end{example}

\noindent Figure \ref{fig:moran's.I} reveals that the spatial relationship of post-war peace survival oscillates between positive autocorrelation (in the 1970s, early 1990s, and late 2000s) and spatial dispersion (in much of the 1980s and late 1990s). Taken together, the Join Count and Moran’s I tests suggest that unobserved heterogeneous risk factors that transcend the borders of a single state may lead to spatial autocorrelation in both the consolidation and duration of post-war peace in \citeauthor{walter2015bad}'s (\citeyear{walter2015bad}) data. This suggests that a Spatial SP survival model is an appropriate method of analysis, particularly if proximate countries share common unobservable risk factors that affect their odds of being immune to war recurrence or the time it takes for renewed war to occur. 

\subsection {Applying the Bayesian Spatial SP survival model}

The \texorpdfstring%
{{\normalfont\ttfamily\hyphenchar\font=-1 spatialSPsurv()}}%
{spatialSPsurv()} function fits the Bayesian Spatial SP survival model, which includes spatially autocorrelated frailties in the model’s split and survival stage and can incorporate time-varying covariates. We illustrate the features of the \texorpdfstring%
{{\normalfont\ttfamily\hyphenchar\font=-1 spatialSPsurv()}}%
{spatialSPsurv()} function by fitting the Bayesian Spatial \emph{Weibull} cure model on \citeauthor{walter2015bad}'s (\citeyear{walter2015bad}) data on post-war peace.\footnote{The results for all models were calculated in \textbf{R} version 4.0.3. on a PC with a 6-core i7 processor.} The log-logistic results are reported in \citet{Bolte2021}. We include the \texorpdfstring%
{{\normalfont\ttfamily\hyphenchar\font=-1 lgdpl}}%
{lgdpl} variable in the estimated model’s split-stage equation, which estimates the probability of units being in the “consolidated” post-war peace group (the “immune” fraction), though it is important to note that  \texorpdfstring%
{{\normalfont\ttfamily\hyphenchar\font=-1 atrisk}}%
{atrisk} is used here as the dependent variable. We estimate the probability of post-war survival among the at-risk fraction as a function of UN peacekeeping (\texorpdfstring%
{{\normalfont\ttfamily\hyphenchar\font=-1 unpko}}%
{unpko}), outright military victory in the previous war (\texorpdfstring%
{{\normalfont\ttfamily\hyphenchar\font=-1 victory}}%
{victory}), the resolution of the previous war via peace agreement (\texorpdfstring%
{{\normalfont\ttfamily\hyphenchar\font=-1 comprehensive}}%
{comprehensive}), and, again, GDP/capita (\texorpdfstring%
{{\normalfont\ttfamily\hyphenchar\font=-1 lgdpl}}%
{lgdpl}). The spatial relationship of each country is incorporated into the model via the spatial weights matrix generated from the \texorpdfstring%
{{\normalfont\ttfamily\hyphenchar\font=-1 spatial\_SA()}}%
{spatial\_SA()} function described earlier.

The Spatial SP survival model is fit via Bayesian methods for inference. The MVN prior is used for the model’s split-stage ($$) and survival-stage ($$) parameters (with the following hyperparameters$s\_=
I\_p1$,$v\_=p1$,$s\_=
I\_p2$,$v\_=p2$). The Gamma prior is used for the hazard’s shape parameter$$(with hyperparameters$a$,$b$), and separate CAR priors---with the Gamma hyperprior assigned to$$for CAR ($$)\footnote{With vague prior $\left(a_{\lambda},b_{\lambda}\right)=\left(0.001,1/0.001\right)=\left(0.001,1000\right)$ as done for $\rho$}  ---incorporate the spatially autocorrelated frailties in the model’s split-stage (\texorpdfstring%
{{\normalfont\ttfamily\hyphenchar\font=-1 V}}%
{V}) and survival stage (\texorpdfstring%
{{\normalfont\ttfamily\hyphenchar\font=-1 W}}%
{W}). Estimation proceeds via the MCMC algorithm described in the previous section. To this end, we specify the MCMC sampler as follows: the argument \texorpdfstring%
{{\normalfont\ttfamily\hyphenchar\font=-1 N = 15,000}}%
{N = 15,000} sets the number of MCMC iterations to 15,000, \texorpdfstring%
{{\normalfont\ttfamily\hyphenchar\font=-1 burn = 5,000}}%
{burn = 5,000} discards the first 5,000 states of the Markov chain, \texorpdfstring%
{{\normalfont\ttfamily\hyphenchar\font=-1 thin = 15}}%
{thin = 15} specifies the number of steps that are employed to prevent autocorrelation, and \texorpdfstring%
{{\normalfont\ttfamily\hyphenchar\font=-1 m = 10}}%
{m = 10} limits the steps in the slice sampling to 10. The argument \texorpdfstring%
{{\normalfont\ttfamily\hyphenchar\font=-1 w = c(1,1,1)}}%
{w = c(1,1,1)} specifies the default values of the size of the slice sampling for$$,$$, and$$. 

For simplicity, we retain the default 0 as the initial value for all parameters with the \texorpdfstring%
{{\normalfont\ttfamily\hyphenchar\font=-1 ini.beta}}%
{ini.beta}, \texorpdfstring%
{{\normalfont\ttfamily\hyphenchar\font=-1 ini.gamma}}%
{ini.gamma}, \texorpdfstring%
{{\normalfont\ttfamily\hyphenchar\font=-1 ini.W}}%
{ini.W}, and \texorpdfstring%
{{\normalfont\ttfamily\hyphenchar\font=-1 ini.V}}%
{ini.V} arguments. We incorporate separate proposal variances, namely \texorpdfstring%
{{\normalfont\ttfamily\hyphenchar\font=-1 prop.varV = 1e-05}}%
{prop.varV = 1e-05} and \texorpdfstring%
{{\normalfont\ttfamily\hyphenchar\font=-1 prop.varW = 1e-05}}%
{prop.varW = 1e-05}, for the split and survival stage frailties (\textbf{V}, \textbf{W}) and then assign separate Metropolis-Hastings proposal steps for estimating these parameters to optimize the acceptance rates. To specify the covariates in the model, \texorpdfstring%
{{\normalfont\ttfamily\hyphenchar\font=-1 duration \textasciitilde}}%
{duration \textasciitilde} precedes the survival-stage covariates, while \texorpdfstring%
{{\normalfont\ttfamily\hyphenchar\font=-1 immune \textasciitilde}}%
{immune \textasciitilde} precedes the split-stage variables. \texorpdfstring%
{{\normalfont\ttfamily\hyphenchar\font=-1 Y0}}%
{Y0} indicates the time elapsed since inception until time t - 1, while \texorpdfstring%
{{\normalfont\ttfamily\hyphenchar\font=-1 LY}}%
{LY} is a dummy that captures the last observation year due to censoring or failure. \texorpdfstring%
{{\normalfont\ttfamily\hyphenchar\font=-1 A = walter[[2]]}}%
{A = walter[[2]]} calls the spatial weights matrix from our list object.  \texorpdfstring%
{{\normalfont\ttfamily\hyphenchar\font=-1 S= 'sp\_id'}}%
{S= 'sp\_id'} (generated by \texorpdfstring%
{{\normalfont\ttfamily\hyphenchar\font=-1 spatial\_SA())}}%
{spatial\_SA())} gives the unit identifier in the spatial weights matrix that matches the units in the data frame. The argument \texorpdfstring%
{{\normalfont\ttfamily\hyphenchar\font=-1 form}}%
{form} is used to specify the parametric survival distribution (which can be either ``Weibull'' or ``loglog'').  

Importantly, the model functions in the \texorpdfstring%
{{\normalfont\fontseries{b}\selectfont BayesSPsurv}}%
{BayesSPsurv} package generate single chains for each parameter, but we provide a routine for estimating multiple chains in parallel on the GitHub repository for the package (\url{https://github.com/Nicolas-Schmidt/BayesSPsurv}). We first discuss the results and diagnostics for the single-chain results using the above MCMC specification and then illustrate the multiple-chain results and diagnostics for the Spatial SP survival model. 

\begin{example}
set.seed(123456)
model <-  spatialSPsurv(duration = duration ~ victory + comprehensive + lgdpl + unpko ,
                            immune = atrisk ~ lgdpl,
                            Y0 = 't.0',
                            LY = 'lastyear',
                            S = 'sp_id' ,
                            data = walter[[1]],
                            N = 15000,
                            burn = 5000,
                            thin = 15,
                            w = c(1,1,1),
                            m = 10,
                            ini.beta =  0,
                            ini.gamma = 0,
                            ini.W = 0,
                            ini.V= 0,
                            form = "Weibull",
                            prop.varV = 1e-05,
                            prop.varW = 1e-05,
                            A = walter[[2]])
\end{example}

\noindent The function automatically provides a progress bar for users to track the percent of the computation that has been completed. The elapsed run time for the Spatial SP Weibull specification being examined here was just under 23 minutes (calculated with \texorpdfstring%
{{\normalfont\ttfamily\hyphenchar\font=-1 system.time()}}%
{system.time()}). Once completed, the generic \texorpdfstring%
{{\normalfont\ttfamily\hyphenchar\font=-1 print()}}%
{print()} function displays the results\footnote{95\% Bayesian Credible Intervals are reported in \citet{Bolte2021}.}:

\noindent The posterior mean estimates suggest that peace agreements, military victory, and peacekeeping units may increase the survival of post-civil war peace, though none of these parameters are highly reliable given their 95\% BCIs, as reported in \citep{Bolte2021}. However, \texorpdfstring%
{{\normalfont\ttfamily\hyphenchar\font=-1 lgdpl}}%
{lgdpl} appears to reliably \textit{increase} the survival of peace among at-risk cases while also reliably \textit{decreasing} the probability of peace ``consolidation'' in the split-stage. Calling the \texorpdfstring%
{{\normalfont\ttfamily\hyphenchar\font=-1 SPstats()}}%
{SPstats()} function calculates the Deviance Information Criterion (DIC) and log-likelihood (LL) statistics from the estimated model, where$DIC

(L-P)$,$L$is the log-likelihood of the data given the posterior means of the covariate parameters, and$P$is the effective number of parameters in the model.

{geweke.diag()} function and the \citet{heidelberger1983} stationarity test via the \texorpdfstring%

{heidel.diag()} function in \href{https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=coda}{\texorpdfstring%

{coda}}. We report the \citet{heidelberger1983} stationarity test results in \citet{Bolte2021} to save space. In this case, the Geweke tests indicate little evidence against convergence for each split-stage and survival-stage covariate, because the test statistics are reasonably close to zero.

[coda](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=coda)'s plot() function can
then be used to display trace and posterior density plots for the single
Markov chains of the model's split-stage $\gamma$, survival-stage
$\beta$, and $\rho$ parameters (which we do not report here to save
space). Users may also wish to validate MCMC convergence using multiple
chains with different initial values for each parameter rather than only
examining single-chain diagnostics. A routine for generating multiple
chains in parallel using the
[doParallel](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=doParallel)
[@doparallel] and [doRNG](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=doRNG)
[@dorng] packages is available on the BayesSPsurv GitHub repository,
though single chains with different starting values can also be run
sequentially. The user can then collect them into a single mcmc.list
object and easily plot the trace and density plots of the multiple
chains. Using the code on GitHub, the Spatial SP survival model was
re-run four times (to generate four chains) with 0, 1, 10, and 50 as the
initial starting values for each of the estimated parameters ($\beta$,
$\gamma$, $\textbf{W}$, and $\textbf{V}$). The trace and density plots
for the multiple chains are reported below (we excluded the $\beta$
intercept for aesthetic reasons), and the total run time was
approximately 28 minutes for all four chains to be generated
simultaneously.

The trace plots for the Spatial SP Weibull model's $\beta$ and $\gamma$
reveal decent mixing between the first three chains, though the fourth
chain appears to take longer to converge. This is unsurprising given its
extreme initial value. We can assess the convergence of the multiple
chains using the Gelman-Rubin diagnostic, which compares the
within-chain variance to the between-chain variance [@gelman]. If the
difference in these variances is large, then the multiple chains likely
have not converged to a proper stationary distribution. We can easily
calculate the potential scale reduction factor (PSRF) with the
gelman.diag() function in coda, which should be approximately 1 if all
chains have converged to a common distribution.

::: example
Potential scale reduction factors:

Point est. Upper C.I. (Intercept) 1.19 1.38 victory 1.17 1.20
comprehensive 1.17 1.19 lgdpl 1.32 2.40 unpko 1.11 1.14

The multivariate PSRF is less than 1.1 in both stages, but the point
estimates for all parameters are still insufficiently far from 1,
suggesting that extending the chains would likely improve the accuracy
of the estimates.

One way to substantively interpret the spatial frailties is to display a
map and determine whether adjacent units share similar frailty values
(e.g., [@darmofal2009bayesian]). The following code from the
[countrycode](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=countrycode)
[@countrycode-package] and
[rworldmap](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=rworldmap)
[@rworldmap-package] packages permits users to create choropleth maps of
the spatial frailty posterior means. Figures
[3](#fig: V){reference-type="ref"
reference="fig: V"}-[4](#fig:W){reference-type="ref" reference="fig:W"}
display the single-chain split-stage ( V) and survival-stage ( W)
frailties from our Spatial SP Weibull model (the code generates Figure
[3](#fig: V){reference-type="ref" reference="fig: V"}; Figure
[4](#fig:W){reference-type="ref" reference="fig:W"} simply uses W in
place of V.

::: example
library(rworldmap) library(countrycode) library(classInt)

Note that in certain regions, there are distinct spatial bands in the
(i) split-stage frailties, which range from -0.633 to 0.381 with a
corresponding standard deviation of 0.34 and (ii) survival-stage
frailties that range from -0.391 to 0.766 with a corresponding standard
deviation of 0.32. These spatial bands reveal geographic clustering in
both consolidation and duration of post-war peace since similar frailty
values often occur near one another.

## Applying the Bayesian Exchangeable and Pooled SP survival models

The BayesSPsurv package can also be used to estimate Bayesian
Exchangeable and Pooled SP survival models. The Exchangeable model
incorporates frailties that are assumed to be statistically independent
in both stages, while the Pooled model excludes frailties altogether. We
again use @walter2015bad's ([-@walter2015bad]) data on post-civil war
peace to illustrate these models. Beginning with the Exchangeable
Weibull SP survival model, we again assign the MVN prior to the model's
$\gamma$ and $\beta$ parameters, the Gamma prior to $\rho$, and the same
default settings for the hyperparameters ($s_\beta = I_{p1}$,
$v_\beta=p1$, $s_\gamma = I_{p2}$, $v_\gamma=p2$, $a_\rho = 1$,
$b_\rho = 1$). We also incorporate separate proposal variance variables
for the nonspatial i.i.d frailties ($V_i$,$W_i$) and assign separate
Metropolis-Hastings steps to estimate these parameters. Further, we use
almost the same MCMC sampler specification as before. However, rather
than incorporating spatial information via an adjacency matrix, we let
id_WV=country to define the country-level nonspatial frailties.

Again, users can assess either single or multiple (parallel) Markov
chains with different starting parameter values when fitting the
Exchangeable SP survival model. We report the single-chain results here
for simplicity. The run time for the above specification was
approximately 16 minutes and 30 seconds. The single-chain results and
model fit statistics are obtained with the print() and SPstats()
functions.

Based on these results, lgdpl is still a highly reliable predictor of
longer peace duration among conflicts at risk of recurrence, while the
other survival stage covariates remain positive but statistically
unreliable. In contrast to the spatial frailty model, however, the
effect of lgdpl on the probability of peace consolidation is now
statistically unreliable. Users interested in displaying and
interpreting the exchangeable frailties can do so in a variety of ways,
but if these results are being compared to those of a spatial frailty
model, we recommend mapping the exchangeable frailty values and
comparing the clustering (or lack thereof) of the i.i.d. frailty terms
to those produced from the spatial model [@darmofal2009bayesian].

Finally, the pooledSPsurv() function fits the Pooled Bayesian SP
survival model. For this application, we again assign the MVN prior to
the model's $\gamma$ and $\beta$ parameters, the Gamma prior to $\rho$,
and the same default settings for the hyperparameters described earlier.

::: example
set.seed(123456) model2 \<- pooledSPsurv(duration = duration   victory +

= c(1,1,1), m = 10, ini.beta = 0, ini.gamma = 0, form = \"Weibull\")
:::

Note that the MCMC sampler is almost identical to that of the previous
two models, but we now *exclude* the separate Metropolis-Hastings
proposal step for the frailities in the MCMC algorithm as well as the
initial values for the frailty estimates since this is a non-frailty
model. The run time for the Pooled model was approximately 10 minutes.
The single-chain output is again easily displayed.

# Conclusion

Survival data often include two populations with different underlying
risk propensities: the immune fraction of right-censored units that will
never experience the event of interest and the at-risk fraction of units
that have or will. Numerous R-packages such as
[smcure](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=smcure),
[nltm](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=nltm), and
[spduration](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=spduration) have been
developed to fit parametric or semi-parametric cure models for
nonspatial survival data, but none of these packages allow the user to
account for spatial autocorrelation in both stages. A separate set of
packages allows the user to include spatially weighted frailties in
conventional survival models
[@taylor2017spatsurv; @spBayesSurv-article], but spatial autocorrelation
may also influence the probability of immunity from an event of
interest. The BayesSPsurv package addresses this lacuna by offering a
suite of functions to fit Bayesian SP survival models. Specifically,
users can estimate Bayesian Pooled, Exchangeable, and Spatial frailty SP
survival models with time-varying covariates, specify their own spatial
weights matrices, and easily examine diagnostic statistics. The applied
potential of the Spatial SP survival model, in particular, is
considerable, as researchers studying anything from the survival of
cancer patients to the survival of political regimes may have a
methodological need to model spatial autocorrelation in the immune
fraction.

Future work can build upon the spatial and nonspatial cure models
presented here to develop estimation routines for survival data with
multiple stages, competing risks, or recurrent events. Moreover,
although BayesSPsurv is the first to allow spatially autocorrelated
frailties in both stages, future work can extend the frailty models in
our package by employing a similar approach as @yin to incorporate
shared frailties with factor loadings to account for any correlation
between the frailty terms ($\textbf{W}$ and $\textbf{V}$) in either
stage. Subsequent iterations of the package will include alternative
baseline hazards based on penalized splines or nonparametric Gaussian
processes as well as the option to use a semiparametric Cox model with
exchangeable or spatial frailties. Implementing these future
developments with an external MCMC sampling dependency built on C++
subroutines like STAN would be useful, given the Hamiltonian Monte Carlo
algorithm's efficiency in sampling from high dimensional posterior
distributions. We also plan to extend BayesSPsurv to accommodate left
and interval censoring and delayed entry.
