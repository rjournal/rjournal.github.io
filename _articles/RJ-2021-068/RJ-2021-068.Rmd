title: 'BayesSPsurv: An R Package to Estimate Bayesian (Spatial) Split-Population
  Survival Models'
abstract: |
  Survival data often include a fraction of units that are susceptible to an event of interest
   as well as a fraction of “immune” units. In many applications, spatial clustering in unobserved risk
   factors across nearby units can also affect their survival rates and odds of becoming immune. To
   address these methodological challenges, this article introduces our BayesSPsurv R-package, which
   fits parametric Bayesian Spatial split-population survival (cure) models that can account for spatial
   autocorrelation in both subpopulations of the user’s time-to-event data. Spatial autocorrelation is
   modeled with spatially weighted frailties, which are estimated using a conditionally autoregressive
   prior. The user can also fit parametric cure models with or without nonspatial i.i.d. frailties, and
   each model can incorporate time-varying covariates. BayesSPsurv also includes various functions to
   conduct pre-estimation spatial autocorrelation tests, visualize results, and assess model performance,
   all of which are illustrated using data on post-civil war peace survival.
