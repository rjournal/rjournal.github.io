title: 'BayesSPsurv: An R Package to Estimate Bayesian (Spatial) Split-Population
  Survival Models'
abstract: Survival data often include a fraction of units that are susceptible to
  an event of interest as well as a fraction of "immune" units. In many applications,
  spatial clustering in unobserved risk factors across nearby units can also affect
  their survival rates and odds of becoming immune. To address these methodological
  challenges, this article introduces our [BayesSPsurv](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=BayesSPsurv)
  R-package, which fits parametric Bayesian Spatial split-population survival (cure)
  models that can account for spatial autocorrelation in both subpopulations of the
  user's time-to-event data. Spatial autocorrelation is modeled with spatially weighted
  frailties, which are estimated using a conditionally autoregressive prior. The user
  can also fit parametric cure models with or without nonspatial i.i.d. frailties,
  and each model can incorporate time-varying covariates. BayesSPsurv also includes
  various functions to conduct pre-estimation spatial autocorrelation tests, visualize
  results, and assess model performance, all of which are illustrated using data on
  post-civil war peace survival.
