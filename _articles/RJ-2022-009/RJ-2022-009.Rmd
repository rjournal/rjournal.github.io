title: 'bayesanova: An R package for Bayesian Inference in the Analysis of Variance
  via Markov Chain Monte Carlo in Gaussian Mixture Models'
abstract: ' This paper introduces the R package [bayesanova](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=bayesanova),
  which performs Bayesian inference in the analysis of variance (ANOVA). Traditional
  ANOVA based on null hypothesis significance testing (NHST) is prone to overestimating
  effects and stating effects if none are present. Bayesian ANOVAs developed so far
  are based on Bayes factors (BF), which also enforce a hypothesis testing stance.
  Instead, the Bayesian ANOVA implemented in bayesanova focusses on effect size estimation
  and is based on a Gaussian mixture with known allocations, for which full posterior
  inference for the component parameters is implemented via Markov-Chain-Monte-Carlo
  (MCMC). Inference for the difference in means, standard deviations and effect sizes
  between each of the groups is obtained automatically. Estimation of the parameters
  instead of hypothesis testing is embraced via the region of practical equivalence
  (ROPE), and helper functions provide checks of the model assumptions and visualization
  of the results. '
