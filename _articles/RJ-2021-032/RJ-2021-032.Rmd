title: 'clustcurv: An R Package for Determining Groups in Multiple Curves '
abstract: ' In many situations, it could be interesting to ascertain whether groups
  of curves can be performed, especially when confronted with a considerable number
  of curves. This paper introduces an R package, known as [clustcurv](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=clustcurv),
  for determining clusters of curves with an automatic selection of their number.
  The package can be used for determining groups in multiple survival curves as well
  as for multiple regression curves. Moreover, it can be used with large numbers of
  curves. An illustration of the use of clustcurv is provided, using both real data
  examples and artificial data. '
