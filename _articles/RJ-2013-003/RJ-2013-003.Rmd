title: Multiple Factor Analysis for Contingency Tables in the FactoMineR Package
abstract: 'We present multiple factor analysis for contingency tables (MFACT) and
  its implementation in the FactoMineR package. This method, through an option of
  the MFA function, allows us to deal with multiple contingency or frequency tables,
  in addition to the categorical and quantitative multiple tables already considered
  in previous versions of the package. Thanks to this revised function, either a multiple
  contingency table or a mixed multiple table integrating quantitative, categorical
  and frequency data can be tackled. The FactoMineR package (Lê et al., 2008; Husson
  et al., 2011) offers the most commonly used principal component methods: principal
  component analysis (PCA), correspondence analysis (CA; Benzécri, 1973), multiple
  correspondence analysis (MCA; Lebart et al., 2006) and multiple factor analysis
  (MFA; Escofier and Pagès, 2008). Detailed presentations of these methods enriched
  by numerous examples can be consulted at the website http://factominer.free.fr/.
  An extension of the MFA function that considers contingency or frequency tables
  as proposed by Bécue-Bertaut and Pagès (2004, 2008) is detailed in this article.
  First, an example is presented in order to motivate the approach. Next, the mortality
  data used to illustrate the method are introduced. Then we briefly describe multiple
  factor analysis (MFA) and present the principles of its extension to contingency
  tables. A real example on mortality data illustrates the handling of the MFA function
  to analyse these multiple tables and, finally, conclusions are presented.'
