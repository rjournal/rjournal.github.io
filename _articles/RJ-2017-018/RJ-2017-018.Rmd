title: 'coxphMIC: An R Package for Sparse Estimation of Cox Proportional Hazards Models
  via Approximated Information Criteria'
abstract: In this paper, we describe an R package named coxphMIC, which implements
  the sparse estimation method for Cox proportional hazards models via approximated
  information criterion (Su et al., 2016). The developed methodology is named MIC
  which stands for “Minimizing approximated Information Criteria". A reparameterization
  step is introduced to enforce sparsity while at the same time keeping the objective
  function smooth. As a result, MIC is computationally fast with a superior performance
  in sparse estimation. Furthermore, the reparameterization tactic yields an additional
  advantage in terms of circumventing post-selection inference (Leeb and Pötscher,
  2005). The MIC method and its R implementation are introduced and illustrated with
  the PBC data.
