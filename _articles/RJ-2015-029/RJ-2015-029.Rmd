title: 'ALTopt: An R Package for Optimal Experimental Design of Accelerated Life Testing'
abstract: 'The R package ALTopt has been developed with the aim of creating and evaluating
  optimal experimental designs of censored accelerated life tests (ALTs). This package
  takes the generalized linear model approach to ALT planning, because this approach
  can easily handle censoring plans and derive information matrices for evaluating
  designs. Three types of optimality criteria are considered: D-optimality for model
  parameter estimation, U-optimality for reliability prediction at a single use condition,
  and I-optimality for reliability prediction over a region of use conditions. The
  Weibull distribution is assumed for failure time data and more than one stress factor
  can be specified in the package. Several graphical evaluation tools are also provided
  for the comparison of different ALT test plans.'
