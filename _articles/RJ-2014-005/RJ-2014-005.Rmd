title: 'The RWiener Package: an R Package Providing Distribution Functions for the
  Wiener Diffusion Model'
abstract: 'We present the RWiener package that provides R functions for the Wiener
  diffusion model. The core of the package are the four distribution functions dwiener,
  pwiener, qwiener and rwiener, which use up-to-date methods, implemented in C, and
  provide fast and accurate computation of the density, distribution, and quantile
  function, as well as a random number generator for the Wiener diffusion model. We
  used the typical Wiener diffusion model with four parameters: boundary separation,
  non-decision time, initial bias and drift rate parameter. Beyond the distribution
  functions, we provide extended likelihood-based functions that can be used for parameter
  estimation and model selection. The package can be obtained via CRAN.'
