title: 'tramME: Mixed-Effects Transformation Models Using Template Model Builder'
abstract: Linear transformation models constitute a general family of parametric regression
  models for discrete and continuous responses. To accommodate correlated responses,
  the model is extended by incorporating mixed effects. This article presents the
  R package tramME, which builds on existing implementations of transformation models
  (mlt and tram packages) as well as Laplace approximation and automatic differentiation
  (using the TMB package), to calculate estimates and perform likelihood inference
  in mixed-effects transformation models. The resulting framework can be readily applied
  to a wide range of regression problems with grouped data structures.
