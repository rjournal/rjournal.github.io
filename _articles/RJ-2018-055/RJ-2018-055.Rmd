title: 'addhaz: Contribution of Chronic Diseases to the Disability Burden Using R'
abstract: The increase in life expectancy followed by the burden of chronic diseases
  contributes to disability at older ages. The estimation of how much chronic conditions
  contribute to disability can be useful to develop public health strategies to reduce
  the burden. This paper introduces the R package addhaz, which is based on the attribution
  method (Nusselder and Looman, 2004) to partition disability into the additive contributions
  of diseases using cross-sectional data. The R package includes tools to fit the
  additive hazard model, the core of the attribution method, to binary and multinomial
  outcomes. The models are fitted by maximizing the binomial and multinomial log-likelihood
  functions using constrained optimization. Wald and bootstrap confidence intervals
  can be obtained for the parameter estimates. Also, the contribution of diseases
  to the disability prevalence and their bootstrap confidence intervals can be estimated.
  An additional feature is the possibility to use parallel computing to obtain the
  bootstrap confidence intervals. In this manuscript, we illustrate the use of addhaz
  with several examples for the binomial and multinomial models, using the data from
  the Brazilian National Health Survey, 2013.
