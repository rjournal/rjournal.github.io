title: 'addhaz: Contribution of Chronic Diseases to the Disability Burden Using R'
abstract: The increase in life expectancy followed by the burden of chronic diseases
  contributes to disability at older ages. The estimation of how much chronic conditions
  contribute to disability can be useful to develop public health strategies to reduce
  the burden. This paper introduces the R package *addhaz*, which is based on the
  attribution method [@nusselder2004] to partition disability into the additive contributions
  of diseases using cross-sectional data. The R package includes tools to fit the
  additive hazard model, the core of the attribution method, to binary and multinomial
  outcomes. The models are fitted by maximizing the binomial and multinomial log-likelihood
  functions using constrained optimization. Wald and bootstrap confidence intervals
  can be obtained for the parameter estimates. Also, the contribution of diseases
  to the disability prevalence and their bootstrap confidence intervals can be estimated.
  An additional feature is the possibility to use parallel computing to obtain the
  bootstrap confidence intervals. In this manuscript, we illustrate the use of *addhaz*
  with several examples for the binomial and multinomial models, using the data from
  the Brazilian National Health Survey, 2013.

# Introduction

The increase in longevity observed worldwide is usually followed by the
burden of chronic diseases, which are among the leading causes of
disability late in life [@beard2016]. Disability has become a public
health priority due to its adverse effects on health outcomes and
quality of life, resulting in increased costs of health care
[@yang2014]. Therefore, the identification of which chronic diseases are
the main contributors to the disability burden plays an important role
in the formulation of public health response to population aging
[@klijs2011].

Although prospective studies are better suited to establish the causal
relationship between chronic diseases and disability, they are costly
and usually with limited sample size. Alternatively, cross-sectional
data has been widely used to investigate the association of chronic
diseases and disability. Among the methods based on cross-sectional
data, the attribution method proposed by [@nusselder2004] has the
advantage of partitioning the disability prevalence into the additive
contributions of chronic diseases, taking into account multimorbidity
and that disability can be present even in the absence of chronic
diseases. The method was originally proposed for binary outcomes, but it
was recently extended to multicategory response variables [@yokota2017]
and it is based on the binomial and multinomial additive hazard models,
respectively. The use of non-canonical link functions in the models
imposes a constraint on the linear predictor, which limits the use of
standard statistical software to fit the models, such as `glm` in R or
`proc GLM` in SAS [@SASsoftware]. Despite this practical difficulty, the
attribution method for binary outcomes has been widely used previously
with data from the Netherlands [@nusselder2004; @klijs2011], Belgium
[@nusselder2005; @yokota2015b], Germany [@strobl2013], China
[@chen2013], and Brazil [@yokota2016], owing to the development of the
software in R to fit the binomial model and to estimate the contribution
of diseases to the disability prevalence by [@nusselder2010] for non-R
users, which is available upon request to the authors
(w.nusselder@erasmusmc.nl).

In this manuscript we present the R package
[*addhaz*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=addhaz), which is an
extension of the R software developed by [@nusselder2010], offering an
open-source implementation of the binomial and multinomial additive
hazard models. The R functions can also be used to calculate the
contribution of chronic diseases to the disability burden for both
models.

This paper is structured as follows. In Section 2, a brief description
of the attribution method is presented, followed by the definition of
the binomial and multinomial additive hazard models. Section 3
introduces some features and options of *addhaz*. The existing
alternative software to fit the binomial and multinomial models is
discussed in Section 4. Examples of how to use the R functions to fit
the models and to estimate contributions are shown in Section 5, using
the data of the 2013 Brazilian National Health Survey (BNHS). The main
advantages and disadvantages of the attribution method and *addhaz* are
discussed in Section 6. Finally, conclusions and recommendations for
future research are outlined in Section 7.

# Attribution method

Analogous to the mortality analysis, in which a single disease is
assigned as underlying cause of death in the death certificate, the
attribution method aims to assess the probability that a single reported
disease was the cause of disability in a survey, taking into account
that individuals can report more than one disease (multimorbidity) and
that disability can be present without any reported diseases
[@nusselder2004; @nusselder2010].

In the attribution method, the disability that is not associated with
any disease included in the analysis is attributed to "background\". The
background can represent the effect of age-related losses in
functioning; underreporting and underdiagnosed diseases; and other
causes of disability that were not included in the survey or analysis.
More details about the attribution method can be found elsewhere
[@nusselder2004; @nusselder2010].

The following assumptions are required to fit the binomial and
multinomial additive hazard models to cross-sectional data: (i)
disability is caused by the diseases that are still present in the time
of the survey and the background; (ii) the estimated cross-sectional
cumulative rates reflect the transition rates that would have been
estimated with longitudinal data (stationarity assumption); (iii) the
recovery rate is zero; (iv) the ratio of the cause-specific cumulative
rates to the overall cumulative rate is constant over time
(proportionality assumption); (v) the start of the time (age) at risk to
become disabled is the same for all diseases; (vi) individuals from the
same age group are exposed to the same cumulative rate of disability for
background; (vii) diseases and background act as independent competing
causes of disability [@nusselder2004; @nusselder2010].

## Binomial additive hazard model

For binary outcomes, the binomial additive hazard model is defined as:

$$\label{eq:1}
\begin{array}{ll}
y_{i} \sim  Bernoulli(\pi_{i}) \\
\pi_{i} = 1-\text{exp}{(-\eta_i)}\\
\eta_{i}= \alpha_{a_i} + \displaystyle \sum_{d=1}^m \beta_d X_{di} \\
\end{array}   (\#eq:1)$$

where $y_i$ is the binary disability outcome; $\pi_i$ is the disability
probability for individual $i$; $\eta_i$ is the linear predictor
representing the overall cumulative rate (or cumulative hazard) of
disability for individual $i$; ${a_i}$ denotes the age group of
individual $i$ (with $f$ age groups, $a_i$ can only get values between
$1, \ldots, f$); $\alpha_{a}$ is the cumulative rate of disability for
background by age group $a$ ($a=1,\ldots,f$); $\beta_d$ is the
cumulative rate of disability (or disabling impact) for disease
$d(1, \ldots, m)$; and $X_{di}$ is the indicator variable for disease
$d$ and individual $i$.

A linear inequality constraint is applied to the linear predictor
($\eta_{i} \geq 0$) to ensure that $\pi_i$ lies between $(0,1)$. The
standard errors ($SE$) for the regression coefficients are estimated
based on the inverse of the observed information matrix. The 95% Wald
confidence intervals (Wald CI) can be obtained using the standard errors
described above (Wald CI) as showed in \@ref(eq:2) or via bootstrapping
[@efron1994].

$$\label{eq:2}
\begin{array}{ll}
\text{95\% Wald CI} = \widehat{\alpha}_a \pm 1.96(\widehat{SE})\\
\text{95\% Wald CI} = \widehat{\beta}_d \pm 1.96(\widehat{SE})
\end{array}   (\#eq:2)$$

## Multinomial additive hazard model

The multinomial additive hazard model is an extension of the binomial
model:

$$\label{eq:3}
\begin{array}{ll}
y_{ij} \sim  Multinomial(1,\Pi_{i}) \\
\pi_{ij}= \left[1-\text{exp}{(-\sum \limits_{q=1}^{c} \eta_{iq})}\right]\left(\frac{\eta_{ij}}{\sum \limits_{q=1}^{c}\eta_{iq}} \right)  \\
\eta_{ij}= \alpha_{a_ij} + \displaystyle \sum_{d=1}^m \beta_{dj} X_{di} \\
\end{array}   (\#eq:3)$$

where $y_{ij}$ is the multinomial response variable (disability) with
one independent observation and vector of disability probabilities
$\Pi_{i} = (\pi_{i0}, \ldots, \pi_{ij}, \ldots, \pi_{ic})$ per
individual $i$; $\pi_{ij}$ is the probability of disability category $j$
for individual $i$; $\eta_{ij}$ is the linear predictor (overall
cumulative rate) for disability category $j$ and individual $i$; ${a_i}$
denotes the age group of individual $i$ (with $f$ age groups, $a_i$ can
only get values between $1, \ldots, f$); $\alpha_{aj}$ is the cumulative
rate of disability category $j$ for background by age group $a$
$(a = 1, \ldots, f)$; $\beta_{dj}$ is the cumulative rate of disability
category $j$ or disabling impact for disease $d(1, \ldots, m)$; and
$X_{di}$ is the indicator variable for disease $d$ and individual $i$.

Besides the inequality constraint in the linear predictor
$\eta_{ij} \geq 0$, an additional constraint is required:
$\sum_{j=1}^c \pi_{ij} < 1$, to ensure that all $\pi_{ij}$ \> 0. Similar
to the binomial case, the standard errors are estimated by the inverse
of the observed information matrix and the 95% Wald CI and bootstrap
percentile confidence intervals (bootstrap CI) can be obtained using
*addhaz*.

## Contribution of chronic diseases and background to the disability prevalence

The attribution of disability to chronic diseases depends on the disease
prevalence ($X_d$) and the disabling impacts of the diseases ($\beta_d$
and $\beta_{dj}$) [@nusselder2004; @nusselder2010]. The contribution of
chronic diseases and background to the disability prevalence can be
calculated in five steps for both binary and multicategory response
variables.

### Binary case

For the binary case, the cause-specific disability probabilities for
individual $i$ and each chronic condition ($\widehat{D}_{di}$) and the
background ($\widehat{B}_i$) are estimated based on the proportionality
assumption, analogous to the competing risks setting in mortality
analysis [@manton1984; @chiang1991]:

$$\label{eq:4}
\begin{array}{ll}
\widehat{D}_{di} = \widehat{\pi_{i}}\left(\frac{\widehat{\beta}_{d} X_{di}}{\widehat{\eta_i}}\right) \\~\\
\widehat{B}_i = \widehat{\pi_{i}}\left(\frac{\widehat{\alpha}_{ai}}{\widehat{\eta_i}}\right) \\
\end{array}   (\#eq:4)$$

Next, the number of disabled individuals by each disease
($\widehat{N}_d$) and background ($\widehat{N}_b$) are estimated as:

$$\label{eq:5}
\begin{array}{ll}
\widehat{N}_d = \displaystyle \sum_{i=1}^n \widehat{D}_{di}\\~\\
\widehat{N}_b = \displaystyle \sum_{i=1}^n \widehat{B}_i\\
\end{array}   (\#eq:5)$$

The absolute contribution of each disease ($\widehat{AC}_d$) and
background ($\widehat{AC}_b$) to the total disability prevalence is
obtained by:

$$\label{eq:6}
\begin{array}{ll}
\widehat{AC}_d = \frac{\widehat{N}_d}{n}\\~\\
\widehat{AC}_b = \frac{\widehat{N}_b}{n}\\
\end{array}   (\#eq:6)$$

The absolute contribution of background and diseases defined above sum
to the disability prevalence ($\widehat{P}$):
$$\label{eq:7}
\begin{array}{ll}
\widehat{P} = \widehat{AC}_b + \displaystyle \sum_{d=1}^m \widehat{AC}_d\\
\end{array}   (\#eq:7)$$

Finally, the relative contribution of diseases ($\widehat{RC}_d$) and
background ($\widehat{RC}_b$) to the disability prevalence is estimated
by:

$$\label{eq:8}
\begin{array}{ll}
\widehat{RC}_d = \frac{\widehat{AC}_d}{\widehat{P}}\\~\\
\widehat{RC}_b = \frac{\widehat{AC}_b}{\widehat{P}}\\
\end{array}   (\#eq:8)$$

The relative contributions ($\widehat{RC}_d$ and $\widehat{RC}_b$) sum
to 1.

### Multinomial case

Analogous to the binomial case, the contribution of chronic diseases to
the disability prevalence for multinomial outcomes can be obtained in
five steps for each category $j$ of the outcome:

1\. Cause-specific disability probabilities for each disease
($\widehat{D}_{dij}$) and background ($\widehat{B}_{ij}$) for individual
$i$:
$$\label{eq:9}
\begin{array}{ll}
\widehat{D}_{dij} = \widehat{\pi}_{ij}\left(\frac{\widehat{\beta}_{dj} X_{di}}{\widehat{\eta}_{ij}}\right)\\~\\
\widehat{B}_{ij} = \widehat{\pi}_{ij}\left(\frac{\widehat{\alpha}_{a_ij}}{\widehat{\eta}_{ij}}\right)\\
\end{array}   (\#eq:9)$$

2\. Number of disabled individuals by each disease ($\widehat{N}_{dj}$)
and background ($\widehat{N}_{bj}$):
$$\label{eq:10}
\begin{array}{ll}
\widehat{N}_{dj} = \displaystyle \sum_{i=1}^n \widehat{D}_{dij}\\~\\
\widehat{N}_{bj} = \displaystyle \sum_{i=1}^n \widehat{B}_{ij}\\
\end{array}   (\#eq:10)$$

3\. Absolute contribution of each disease ($\widehat{AC}_{dj}$) and
background ($\widehat{AC}_{bj}$) to the total disability prevalence:
$$\label{eq:11}
\begin{array}{ll}
\widehat{AC}_{dj} = \frac{\widehat{N}_{dj}}{n}\\~\\
\widehat{AC}_{bj} = \frac{\widehat{N}_{bj}}{n}\\
\end{array}   (\#eq:11)$$

4\. Total disability prevalence ($\widehat{P}_j$):
$$\label{eq:12}
\begin{array}{ll}
\widehat{P}_j = \widehat{AC}_{bj} + \displaystyle \sum_{d=1}^m \widehat{AC}_{dj}\\
\end{array}   (\#eq:12)$$

5\. Relative contribution of diseases ($\widehat{RC}_{dj}$) and
background ($\widehat{RC}_{bj}$) to the disability prevalence:
$$\label{eq:13}
\begin{array}{ll}
\widehat{RC}_{dj} = \frac{\widehat{AC}_{dj}}{\widehat{P}_j}\\~\\
\widehat{RC}_{bj} = \frac{\widehat{AC}_{bj}}{\widehat{P}_j}\\
\end{array}   (\#eq:13)$$

The absolute contributions defined in equations \@ref(eq:11) sum to the
prevalence of disability for each category $j$ and the relative
contributions defined in equations \@ref(eq:13) sum to 1 for each
disability category $j$. The confidence intervals for the absolute and
relative contributions for the binary and multinomial cases can be
estimated via bootstrapping [@efron1994] in *addhaz*.

# Features of *addhaz*

In this section, a brief explanation about the constrained optimization,
the parallel option to obtain the bootstrap CI for the parameter
estimates, and the option to perform the likelihood ratio test for model
selection is provided.

## Constrained optimization

The binomial and multinomial additive hazard models are generalized
linear models with non-canonical link functions
$\eta_i = \text{log} \left(\frac{1}{1-\pi_i}\right)$ for the binomial
model and
$\eta_{ij} = [-\text{log}(1-\sum_{q=1}^c \pi_{iq})]\left(\frac{\pi_{ij}}{\sum_{q=1}^c \pi_{iq}}\right)$
for the multinomial model. For both models, the model parameters are
estimated using maximum likelihood. The use of non-canonical link
functions requires a constraint in the linear predictors
($\eta_i \geq 0$ and $\eta_{ij} \geq 0$) to ensure that the disability
probabilities ($\pi_{i}$ and $\pi_{ij}$) are valid, i.e., the
probabilities lie between 0 and 1. In *addhaz*, this constraint is
implemented in the optimization procedure, with an adaptive barrier
algorithm [@lange2010], by calling `constrOptim` in R.

## Parallel computing for the bootstrap CI

Besides the option to estimate the confidence intervals for the
parameter estimates based on the standard errors obtained by the inverse
of the information matrix for the binomial and multinomial models (Wald
CI), *addhaz* also offers the user the option to obtain the bootstrap CI
based on empirical percentiles of the replicates [@efron1994].

To reduce computation time, parallel computing can be used to obtain the
bootstrap CI. By default R does not use all the cores available on a
computer. The basic idea of parallel computing is to split the work to
more than one core of the computer, to execute it in parallel, and then
to collect the results. Several R packages can be used to implement
parallel computation. In *addhaz* it is implemented by calling the
functions `boot` and `boot.ci` in the
[*boot*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=boot) package
[@ripley2016; @davison1997].

## Likelihood ratio test

The package also includes a function to perform the likelihood ratio
test to compare two binomial or multinomial nested models that can be
used for model selection.

The likelihood ratio test is defined as -2\*log(likelihood model
1/likelihood model 2).The resulting test statistic is assumed to follow
a $\chi^2$ distribution, with degrees of freedom (df) equal to the
difference of the df between the models. If the test is statistically
significant, the model with more variables fits the data significantly
better than the model with less variables.

# Alternative software

The original software for the attribution method
[@nusselder2004; @nusselder2010] was developed in R, but it is not
available as an R package, since it focuses on non-R users: an Excel
file is used to input the model arguments and this file is called in the
R code. This software is restricted to binary outcomes and it is freely
available upon request to the authors. Different from *addhaz*, a
penalty term is added to the binomial likelihood function when
$\pi_i \leq 0$, to ensure that valid probabilities are obtained. The
original software also allows the user to obtain the bootstrap CI for
the model parameters and contributions. Additionally, it offers the
options: (i) reduced rank regression (RRR) [@yee2014] to reduce the
number of parameters when interactions between diseases and age groups
are of interest; and (ii) model selection, using the likelihood ratio
test.

Besides the original software, the parameter estimates of the binomial
additive hazard model can be obtained using the R packages
[*stats*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=stats) with `glm` and
[*logbin*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=logbin) with the function
`logbin` [@logbin2016]. In both packages, the log-binomial model, i.e.,
$\pi_i=\text{exp}(\eta_i)$, used to estimate relative risks
[@marschner2012], can be fitted to a transformed version of the response
variable $y^{*} = 1 - y$, with the log link function. The estimated
model parameters should be multiplied by $-1$, since
$1-\pi_i = \text{exp}(-\eta_i)$. However, care should be taken with
`glm`: by specifying the option `family = binomial(link = log)` to fit
the log-binomial model, convergence failure may occur with the iterative
weighted least squares (IWLS) algorithm when the maximum likelihood
estimates (MLE) lie on the boundary of the parameter space. In `glm`,
the IWLS is modified so that if constraints are violated, step-halving
is used iteratively until they are respected. Although this should not
result in invalid estimates, it may cause difficulty in convergence. An
advantage of *logbin* is that it includes constrained optimization as an
option to optimize the binomial log-likelihood function
`(method = "ab")`. This is done by calling `constrOptim` in R to
constrain the parameter space.

Since *addhaz* was developed with focus on the attribution method, apart
from estimating the model parameters for the binomial additive hazard
model, it also gives the user the option to obtain the contribution of
diseases to the disability prevalence and to obtain bootstrap CI for the
parameter estimates and the contributions, using parallel computing to
reduce computation time.

To our knowledge, there is no other package available to fit the
multinomial additive hazard model. Although it is possible to fit the
log-multinomial model [@blizzard2007], i.e.,
$\pi_{ij}=\text{exp}(\eta_{ij})$, with the function `vglm` in
[*VGAM*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=VGAM) [@vgam2016], different
from the binomial case, no simple transformation of the outcome can be
applied to obtain the parameter estimates of the multinomial additive
hazard model using the log-multinomial model.

# Using the package *addhaz*

In this section, the use of the functions `BinAddHaz`, `MultAddHaz`, and
`LRTest` in *addhaz* are illustrated using a subset of the 2013 BNHS
available in the package. A selected output of the results is shown.

## Data description

The Brazilian National Health Survey (BNHS) ("Pesquisa Nacional de
Saúde\") was a nationally representative survey of the Brazilian adult
population ($\geq 18$ years) with approximately 60,000 individuals,
conducted in 2013. A multistage sampling design with simple random
sampling (census tracts) and clustering (households and adults) was
used. The response rate was 77%. Survey weights were included to take
into account the complex design of the sample. Detailed information
about the BNHS can be found in previous publications
[@celia2014; @yokota2016].

In *addhaz*, a subset of the BNHS data is available, with women aged
$\geq$ 60 years (n = 6,294) and the following variables: disability as
binary and multinomial outcomes, survey weight, age, diabetes,
arthritis, and stroke (Table [1](#table:1)).

The binomial and multinomial disability outcomes were defined based on
five instrumental activities of daily living (IADL): shopping, handling
finances, taking own medications, going to the doctor, and using
transportation. Participants were asked about the degree of difficulty
in performing IADL tasks, with possible answers: "1. Unable\", "2. A lot
of difficulty\", "3. Some difficulty\", or "4. No difficulty\". The
definition of the binary and multinomial outcomes is shown in Table
[2](#table:2). The reference category "No disability\" represents answer
"4\" to all IADL questions.

## Examples with binary outcomes

The function `BinAddHaz` fits the binomial additive hazard model and
estimates the contribution of diseases to the disability burden for
binary outcomes in *addhaz*. To illustrate the use of `BinAddHaz`, five
models were fitted with the binary disability outcome: model 1 - with
three diseases (no background and diseases by age); model 2 - with only
background by age, with bootstrap CI; model 3 - with only diseases by
age; model 4 - with background and diseases by age, with bootstrap CI;
model 5 - with two-way interaction between diseases. To illustrate how
the `LRTest` function can be used for model selection, models 2 and 4
are compared.

### Model 1 - Binomial model with three diseases

Before fitting model 1, *addhaz* and the data can be loaded and the
names of the variables can be checked using:

``` r
library("addhaz")
data("disabData")
names(disabData)

[1] "dis.bin" "dis.mult" "wgt" "age" "diab" "arth" "stro"
```

The first binomial model can be fitted with:

``` r
model1 <- BinAddHaz(dis.bin ~ diab + arth + stro , data = disabData, weights = wgt, 
                    attrib = TRUE, type.attrib = "both", collapse.background = FALSE, 
                    attrib.disease = FALSE)
```

Since no attribution variable such as age was included in the model, the
arguments `collapse.background` and `attrib.disease` were set to
`FALSE`. The results of the model were stored as an object called
`model1`, which can be checked with the `summary` function:

``` r
summary(model1)

$`call`
BinAddHaz(formula = dis.bin ~ diab + arth + stro, data = disabData, 
          weights = wgt, attrib = TRUE, collapse.background = FALSE, 
          attrib.disease = FALSE, type.attrib = "both")

$bootstrap
[1] FALSE

$coefficients
             Estimate      StdErr   t.value       p.value
(Intercept) 0.2970833 0.009426403 31.516082 1.498823e-202
diab        0.1331831 0.023821666  5.590838  2.354697e-08
arth        0.1306445 0.022203662  5.883917  4.212860e-09
stro        0.5927519 0.075697633  7.830521  5.663378e-15

attr(,"class")
[1] "summary.binaddhazmod"
```

The first element of the output `call` is the formula used to fit the
model. The `bootstrap`, indicates if the bootstrap CI was requested.
Since it was not requested, its value is `FALSE`.

Next, the coefficients are printed, with their estimates, standard
errors (calculated based on the inverse of the observed information
matrix), the $t$ value (value of the $t$ statistic), and the $p$ value.
The intercept represents the background. According to this output, all
diseases were significant in the model. To identify the most disabling
diseases, i.e., the diseases with highest cumulative rate of disability,
the coefficients can be sorted in decreasing order using:

``` r
sort(model1$coefficients, decreasing = TRUE)

   stro    (Intercept)    diab        arth
0.5927519   0.2970833   0.1331831   0.1306445
```

Stroke was the most disabling disease, while arthritis was the least
disabling disease. The 95% Wald CI can be obtained by:

``` r
model1$ci

                 CI2.5    CI97.5
(Intercept) 0.27860754 0.3155590
diab        0.08649261 0.1798735
arth        0.08712532 0.1741637
stro        0.44438455 0.7411193
```

Both the relative and absolute contributions were requested
(`attrib = TRUE, type.attrib = "both"`) and can be assessed with:

``` r
model1$contribution

$`att.rel`
               att.rel
(Intercept) 0.80405374
diab        0.06938567
arth        0.07451155
stro        0.05204903

$att.abs
               att.abs
disab       0.30853338
(Intercept) 0.24807742
diab        0.02140780
arth        0.02298930
stro        0.01605886
```

In the above output, the relative contribution (`att.rel`: the
contributions sum to 1) is shown at the top and the absolute
contribution (`att.abs`: the contributions sum to the disability
prevalence) is presented at the bottom. No confidence intervals are
provided for the contributions, as they can only be calculated via
bootstrapping and this option was not requested.

In the output for the absolute contribution, the disability prevalence
(`disab`) was 30.9%. The absolute contribution can be sorted in
decreasing order using:

``` r
model1$contribution$att.abs[order(model1$contribution$att.abs[, 1], decreasing = TRUE), ]

    disab   (Intercept)     arth       diab        stro
0.30853338  0.24807742  0.02298930  0.02140780  0.01605886
```

The background `(Intercept)` was the main contributor to the disability
burden in this population. In this case, it can represent other causes
not included in the model such as dementia or back pain, which are
important causes of disability in the older population, but were not
included in the analysis. Among the three diseases, arthritis was the
main contributor to the disabilitiy burden in older Brazilian women.

It is interesting to note that, although stroke was the most disabling
disease, it showed the lowest contribution to the total disability
prevalence. This low contribution can be a consequence of the low
occurrence of stroke in this population - 4.5% (Table [3](#table:3)) -
as the contribution of chronic conditions to the disability prevalence
depends on both, the disease occurrence and the disabling impact
[@nusselder2010].

### Model 2 - Binomial model with only background by age, with bootstrap CI

In model 2, the background is modelled by age group, but the diseases
are not. The model can be fitted by:

``` r
model2 <- BinAddHaz(dis.bin ~ factor(age) -1 + diab + arth + stro , data = disabData, 
                    weights = wgt, attrib = TRUE, type.attrib = "both", 
                    collapse.background = FALSE, attrib.disease = FALSE, seed = 111, 
                    bootstrap = TRUE, conf.level = 0.95, nbootstrap = 1000, 
                    parallel = TRUE, type.parallel = "snow", ncpus = 4)
```

Since the background is modelled by age group, `factor(age)` is included
in the model. The `-1` is included in the `model.formula` to obtain the
coefficients for both age groups, including the reference category.
Since the background is modelled by age, it should not be collapsed by
age (`collapse.background = FALSE`). As no interaction between diseases
and age were included in the model, the argument `attrib.disease` is
`FALSE`. The option `seed = 111` allows the user to specify a random
number to make the results of the bootstrapping reproducible. In the
example above, the random number used was 111. The bootstrap CI for the
regression coefficients and the contributions was requested
(`bootstrap = TRUE`), with confidence level = 0.95
(`conf.level = 0.95`). The bootstrap CI was based on 1000 replicates
(`nbootstrap = 1000`) and it was obatined with parallel computing
(`parallel = TRUE`) on Windows (`type.parallel = "snow"`) with 4 CPUS
(`ncpus = 4`).

The summary of the model can be assessed with:

``` r
summary(model2)

$`call`
BinAddHaz(formula = dis.bin ~ factor(age) - 1 + diab + arth + stro, data = disabData, 
          weights = wgt, attrib = TRUE, type.attrib = "both", 
          collapse.background = FALSE, attrib.disease = FALSE, seed = 111, 
          bootstrap = TRUE, conf.level = 0.95, nbootstrap = 1000, 
          parallel = TRUE, type.parallel = "snow", ncpus = 4)

$bootstrap
[1] TRUE

$coefficients

$conf.level
[1] 0.95

attr(,"class")
[1] "summary.binaddhazmod"
```

Since the bootstrap CI was requested, `bootstrap` is `TRUE`. The
coefficients show that age and all diseases were significant (the null
value, i.e. 0, is not included in the bootstrap CI). The `factor(age)0`
and `factor(age)1` represents the background cumulative rates for age
groups 0 and 1, respectively. The contributions can be checked with:

``` r
model2$contribution

$att.rel
             Contribution      CILow     CIHigh

stro           0.01419161 0.01127267 0.01727091
```

The contributions and the 95% bootstrap CI are shown. The background is
the main contributor to the disability prevalence. Note that by allowing
the background to vary by age does not change the disability prevalence
(30.9%), as compared to model 1.

### Model 3 - Binomial model with only diseases by age

In Model 3, we allow only the diseases to vary by age group by including
interactions between age and diseases in the model. Before fitting model
3, a matrix with the diseases to be included in the model can be defined
by:

``` r
disease <- as.matrix(disabData[, c("diab", "arth", "stro")])
```

The first six elements of the matrix created can be checked using:

``` r
head(disease)

    diab arth stro
36     1    0    0
98     0    0    0
113    0    1    1
347    1    0    0
352    1    0    0
436    0    0    0
```

The binomial additive hazard model can be fitted with the function:

``` r
model3 <- BinAddHaz(dis.bin ~ disease:factor(age), data = disabData, weights = wgt, 
                    attrib = TRUE, attrib.var = age, type.attrib = "abs",
                    collapse.background = FALSE, attrib.disease = TRUE)
summary(model3)

$`call`
BinAddHaz(formula = dis.bin ~ disease:factor(age), data = disabData, weights = wgt, 
          attrib = TRUE, attrib.var = age, collapse.background = FALSE, 
          attrib.disease = TRUE, type.attrib = "abs")

$bootstrap
[1] FALSE

$coefficients
                           Estimate      StdErr    t.value       p.value

```

The `(Intercept)` represents the background, which was not modelled by
age. The diseases with `factor(age)0` and `factor(age)1` represent the
regression coefficients for age 0 (60-79 years) and age 1
($\geq$`<!-- -->`{=html}80 years). The output above shows that arthritis
was not significant for the reference age category (60-79years)
(`diseasearth:factor(age)0`). Only the absolute contribution was
requested (`type.attrib = "abs"`) and it can be assessed with:

``` r
model3$contribution

                               att.abs
disab.0                    0.277835632
backgrnd.0                 0.251005540
diseasediab:factor(age)0.0 0.012575547
diseasearth:factor(age)0.0 0.002220039
diseasestro:factor(age)0.0 0.012034506
disab.1                    0.493678649
backgrnd.1                 0.206353130
diseasediab:factor(age)1.1 0.089832332
diseasearth:factor(age)1.1 0.158378063
diseasestro:factor(age)1.1 0.039115125
```

The attribution is presented by level of the attribution variable
(`attrib.var`), which in this example is age. The first five rows show
the results for attribution variable level 0, which in this case
represents age group 60-79 years and the last five rows represent the
results for attribution variable level 1 ($\geq$`<!-- -->`{=html}80
years). The results indicate that the disability prevalence in the older
women (49.4%) was much larger than in the younger age group (27.8%).
While the three diseases included in the model showed a low contribution
to the disability prevalence in women aged 60-79 years (\<1.5%),
arthritis was by far the most important disease contributing to the
disability prevalence in the oldest women (15.9%).

### Model 4 - Binomial model with background and diseases by age, with bootstrap CI

The same matrix of diseases defined for model 3 will be used in model 4.
This model can be fitted with the function:

``` r
model4 <- BinAddHaz(dis.bin ~ factor(age) - 1 + disease:factor(age), data = disabData,
                    weights = wgt, attrib = TRUE, attrib.var = age, type.attrib = "abs",
                    collapse.background = FALSE, attrib.disease = TRUE, seed = 111, 
                    bootstrap = TRUE, conf.level = 0.95, nbootstrap = 1000, 
                    parallel = TRUE, type.parallel = "snow", ncpus = 4)
```

The `-1` in the `model.formula` is used to obtain a different
parameterization than the default: here we obtain the parameter
estimates for all the age groups, including the reference category.
Since we want to estimate the contributions for background by age, the
argument `collapse.background` is set to `FALSE`. If this argument would
be set to `TRUE`, only one background, common to all age groups, would
be estimated. Since the contributions of diseases should be estimated by
age group, the argument `attrib.disease` was set to `TRUE`. The parallel
option for the bootstrap CI was used (`parallel = TRUE`) on a Windows
computer (`type.parallel = "snow"`) with 4 cores (`ncpus = 4`). The
option `seed = 111` allows the user to specify a random number (in this
case 111) to make the results of the bootstrapping reproducible. The
summary of the model can be checked with:

``` r
summary(model4)

$call
BinAddHaz(formula = dis.bin ~ factor(age) - 1 + disease:factor(age), data = disabData, 
          weights = wgt, attrib = TRUE, attrib.var = age, collapse.background = FALSE, 
          attrib.disease = TRUE, type.attrib = "abs", seed = 111, bootstrap = TRUE, 
          conf.level = 0.95, nbootstrap = 1000, parallel = TRUE, 
          type.parallel = "snow", ncpus = 4)

The output with the results of the model is shown for `factor(age)0`,
which represents the age group of 60-79 years, and `factor(age)1`,
representing the age group of $\geq$`<!-- -->`{=html}80 years. Diabetes
was not significant for age group 1, as the bootstrap CI includes the
null value, i.e. 0. To identify the most disabling diseases, two objects
(`coef.age0` and `coef.age1`) with the coefficients for each age group
can be created and sorted in decreasing order using:

``` r
coef.age0 <- model4$coefficients[seq(1, length(model4$coefficients), 2)]
coef.age1 <- model4$coefficients[seq(0, length(model4$coefficients), 2)]

sort(coef.age0, decreasing = TRUE)

Stroke was the most disabling disease in both age groups. Arthritis and
diabetes showed the lowest disabling impact in women aged 60-79 years
and $\geq$`<!-- -->`{=html}80 years, respectively.

Since only the absolute contribution was requested
(`type.attrib = "abs"`), the results for the absolute contribution can
be assessed with:

The CILow and CIHigh refers to the 2.5th and 97.5th percentiles of the
1,000 bootstrap replicates, since the bootstrap CI was requested
(`bootstrap = TRUE`) with `conf.level = 0.95`. To identify the main
contributors to the disability burden, two objects (one for each age
group) can be defined with the absolute contribution and bootstrap CI
using:

``` r
cont.age0 <- model4$contribution[c(1:5), ]
cont.age1 <- model4$contribution[c(6:10), ]
cont.age0[order(cont.age0[, 1], decreasing = TRUE), ]

```

According to the results, the disability prevalence in the oldest women
(69.5%) was 2.8 times larger than in women aged 60-79 years (24.4%). The
background was the main contributor to the disability prevalence in both
age groups. Among the chronic conditions, diabetes was the main
contributor to the disability prevalence in women aged 60-79 years
(2.1%) while arthritis contributed most to the disability burden in
older women (9.1%).

### Model 5 - Binomial model with two-way interaction between diseases

In model 5, the independence assumption (assumption vii) is violated and
two-way interactions between diseases are included in the model. In
total, 6 parameters and the intercept will be estimated in model 5. The
model can be fitted by:

``` r
model5 <- BinAddHaz(dis.bin ~ (diab + arth + stro)^2, data = disabData, weights = wgt,
                    attrib = TRUE, collapse.background = FALSE, attrib.disease = FALSE, 
                    type.attrib = "both")

summary(model5)

$`call`
BinAddHaz(formula = dis.bin ~ (diab + arth + stro)^2, data = disabData, weights = wgt, 
          attrib = TRUE, collapse.background = FALSE, attrib.disease = FALSE,
          type.attrib = "both")

$bootstrap
[1] FALSE

```

The main effects of all the diseases were significant, but only the
interaction between diabetes and arthritis and between diabetes and
stroke were significant. The negative disabling impact of the
interaction term between diabetes and stroke should be carefully
interpreted, as it is based on a small sample size ($n = 91$) (Table
[3](#table:3)).

### Likelihood ratio test for model selection

To illustrate the use of the function `LRTest` to perform the likelihood
ratio test (LRT) for model selection, models 2 (`model2`) and 4
(`model4`) are compared. The LRT can be performed with:

``` r
LRTest(model4, model2)

Likelihood ratio test
Model 1: 
dis.bin ~ factor(age) - 1 + disease:factor(age)
Model 2: 
dis.bin ~ factor(age) - 1 + diab + arth + stro
  Res.df  Res.Dev df Deviance   Pr(>Chi)
1   6286 6916.818                       
2   6289 6946.224  3   29.405 1.8407e-06
```

The output shows the models that are being compared: `Model 1` is the
model with the interactions with diseases and age (previous model 4) and
`Model 2` is the model without the interactions between diseases and age
(previous model 2). The degrees of freedom for each model (`Res.df`),
the residual deviance, i.e. the 2\*log-likelihood of each model
(`Res.Dev`), the difference in the degrees of freedom between the models
(`df`), the difference between the 2\*log-likelihood of the models, i.e.
the value of the likelihood ratio test statistic (`Deviance`), and the
p-value of the test statistic, based on the $\chi^2$ distribution
(`Pr(>Chi)`) are presented. Since the test was statistically significant
at 0.05 significance level, model 4, which includes interaction between
diseases and age, fits the data better than model 2.

## Examples with multinomial outcomes

To fit the multinomial additive hazard model and to estimate the
contribution of chronic conditions to the disability burden for
multinomial outcomes, the function `MultAddHaz` can be used. As an
illustration, two models were fitted: model 6 - with only background by
age; and model 7 - with background and diseases by age, with bootstrap
CI.

### Model 6 - Multinomial model with only background by age

Model 6 can be fitted with the function:

``` r
model6 <- MultAddHaz(dis.mult ~ factor(age) - 1 + diab + arth + stro, data = disabData, 
                     weights = wgt, attrib = TRUE, seed = 111, collapse.background = FALSE, 
                     attrib.disease = FALSE,  type.attrib = "both")
```

The results of the model can be visualized using:

``` r
summary(model6)

$`call`
MultAddHaz(formula = dis.mult ~ factor(age) - 1 + diab + arth + 
           stro, data = disabData, weights = wgt, attrib = TRUE, seed = 111, 
           collapse.background = FALSE, attrib.disease = FALSE, type.attrib = "both")

In the above output, the results identified with $y1$ refer to the
outcome (dis.mult) = 1 (mild disability) and the results with $y2$ refer
to the outcome (dis.mult) = 2 (severe disability). For mild disability
only the background (`factor(age)0.y1`) and (`factor(age)1.y1`) was
significant while all the diseases and the background were signifcant
for women with severe disability. Similar to the binomial model, the
most disabling diseases can be identified by:

``` r
coef.mild <- model6$coefficients[1:5, ]
coef.sev <- model6$coefficients[6:10, ]

sort(coef.mild, decreasing = TRUE)
factor(age)1.y1 factor(age)0.y1         stro.y1         arth.y1         diab.y1 
    0.285541582     0.117959944     0.024923984     0.015602747     0.002717701

```

Background and stroke showed the highest disabling impact for mild and
severe disability. The relative and absolute contributions can be
checked with:

``` r

```

It is interesting to note that the severe disability prevalence (19.0%)
was 1.5 times higher than the mild disability prevalence (12.7%). The
results for the relative contribution can be sorted in decreasing order
by:

``` r
rel.cont.mild <- model6$contribution$att.rel[1:5, ]
rel.cont.sev <- model6$contribution$att.rel[6:10, ]

sort(rel.cont.mild, decreasing = TRUE)
factor(age)0.y1 factor(age)1.y1         arth.y1         stro.y1         diab.y1 
    0.804099194     0.164283693     0.023317949     0.004633619     0.003665546

sort(rel.cont.sev, decreasing = TRUE)
factor(age)0.y2 factor(age)1.y2         diab.y2         stro.y2         arth.y2 
     0.42687474      0.33665554      0.10556615      0.07191924      0.05898433 
```

The background was the main contributor to the disability burden,
representing 96.8% (0.80 + 0.16) and 76.4% (0.43 + 0.34) of the mild and
severe disability prevalence, respectively. Arthritis (2.3%) was the
main contributor to the mild disability prevalence while diabetes
(10.6%) contributed most to the severe disability prevalence.

### Model 7 - Multinomial model with background and diseases by age, with bootstrap CI

The matrix with the diseases (`disease`) defined for model 3 is used to
fit model 7:

``` r
model7 <- MultAddHaz(dis.mult ~ factor(age) -1 + disease:factor(age), 
                     data = disabData, weights = wgt, attrib = TRUE, attrib.var = age, 
                     seed = 111, collapse.background = FALSE, attrib.disease = TRUE,  
                     type.attrib = "both", bootstrap = TRUE, conf.level = 0.95, 
                     nbootstrap = 1000, parallel = TRUE, type.parallel = "snow", 
                     ncpus = 4)
```

The `-1` was added to the `model.formula` to obtain the parameter
estimates for the background for all age groups, including the reference
category. Since the background should be estimated by age,
`collapse.background` is set to `FALSE`. Additionally, `attrib.disease`
is set to `TRUE`, as interactions between age and diseases were included
in the model and the contribution of diseases should be estimated by
age. The `seed` argument in `MultAddHaz` is used to obtain reproducible
results for the starting values used in the constrained optimization,
which are randomly generated, and for the bootstrap CI. Besides the
`summary` function, the disabling impacts and the bootstrap CI can also
be assessed with:

``` r
cbind(model7$coefficients, model7$ci)

factor(age)1:diseasestro.y2  1.233578243  0.49988818 2.27216717
```

In the output, `factor(age)0` and `factor(age)1` refers to the age
groups 60-79 years and $\geq$ 80 years, respectively. `y1` refers to
disability category 1, which here represents mild disability and `y2`
refers to disability category 2, representing severe disability.

Two coefficients (for diabetes and stroke in women aged $\geq$ 80 years
with mild disability) were negative. This suggests a "protective\"
effect of these conditions. However, these results should be carefully
interpreted as they were not statistically significant.

To identify the most disabling diseases for mild and severe disability
by age group, the following code can be used:

``` r
mild.age0 <- model7$coefficients[seq(1, length(model7$coefficients), 2), ][1:4]
sev.age0 <- model7$coefficients[seq(1, length(model7$coefficients), 2), ][5:8]

                  0.6354636                   0.2829865
```

Stroke was the most disabling disease in women with severe disability in
both age groups and in women aged 60-79 years with mild disability while
arthritis was the most disabling disease in women aged $\geq$ 80 years
with mild disability.

The main contributors to the disability burden, based on the absolute

The severe disability prevalence (60-79 years = 13.8%;
$\geq$`<!-- -->`{=html}80 years = 52.8%) was larger than the mild
disability prevalence (60-79 years = 11.5%; $\geq$`<!-- -->`{=html}80
years = 25.3%) in both age groups. Arthritis was the main contributor to
the mild disability prevalence in both age groups and to the severe
disability prevalence in women aged $\geq$`<!-- -->`{=html}80 years,
while diabetes was the main contributor to the severe disability
prevalence in women aged 60-79 years.

# Discussion

In this paper we introduced the R package *addhaz* developed to fit the
binomial and multinomial additive hazard models to estimate the
contribution of diseases to the disability prevalence using
cross-sectional data.

The R package *addhaz* was developed based on the R functions developed
by Nusselder and Looman [@nusselder2010] for binomial disability
outcomes and for non-R users. The main advantages of *addhaz* compared
to the original R functions are: (i) option to use the attribution
method for multinomial responses using the function `MultAddHaz`; and
(ii) option to do parallel computing for the calculation of the
bootstrap percentile confidence intervals. However, the possibility to
use reduced rank regression [@yee2014] to estimate the cause-specific
disability rates by age group, for example, which is available in the
original R functions [@nusselder2010], is not available in *addhaz*.
Nonetheless, in *addhaz* these interactions can be estimated by
including full interaction terms between chronic conditions and age
groups.

Although the parameter estimates of the binomial additive hazard model
can also be obtained with the R package *logbin*, the contribution of
diseases to the disability prevalence is not provided, since *logbin*
was not developed with focus on the attribution method. Therefore, for
analysis aimed at the attribution of disability to diseases, we
recommend the use of *addhaz*. For multinomial outcomes, no other
software is available to fit the multinomial additive hazard model and
to calculate the contributions, to our knowledge.

One could argue that instead of using the multinomial model, two
binomial models could be fitted: (i) no x mild disability; and (ii) no x
severe disability. Although this is indeed possible, with a minor loss
of precision (larger standard errors) for the parameter estimates when
the reference category ("no disability\", in our example) is the most
frequent category in the population (which is the case for the subset of
the BNHS used here, as 67% were not disabled, 13% reported mild
disability, and 20% were severely disabled) [@agresti2002], the
prevalence of the various disability categories do not sum to 100%, as
can be observed in a previous study that assessed the difference in the
mild and severe disability burden using two binomial models
[@yokota2015].

Different models with different options were presented using *addhaz*,
showing a wide possibility of application to the users. One example is
the investigation of the role of multimorbidity on the disability
prevalence, which was assessed by the inclusion of two-way interactions
between diseases in the model, as presented in model 2. Even though the
examples only included the combination of two diseases, higher order
interactions can also be included in the models, with the sample size
being the limiting factor. In addition, since the prevalence of chronic
conditions tends to increase over age, the model parameterization to
include interactions between diseases and age groups was also shown for
the binary (models 3 and 4) and multinomial disability outcomes (model
7). Although age group was used as the stratification variable to
estimate the disabling impacts of the diseases and background, other
variables can be used, such as education attainment and sex.

Furthermore, we illustrated how the likelihood ratio test (LRT) can be
performed for model selection using the function `LRTest`. The LRT can
be also performed for model selection with the multinomial additive
hazard model.

The attribution method has some limitations that should be considered.
The main limitation of the method is the causality assumption. Although
a causal relationship between diseases and disability is plausible and
has been proposed in several disability models [@verbrugge1994], it
cannot be assessed with cross-sectional data. As a consequence,
disability is incorrectly attributed to diseases when disability
occurred before the diseases. Although the parallel option reduces
significantly computation time for calculating bootstrap confidence
intervals, fitting the multinomial model to high dimensional data can
still be time-consuming. For example, the computational time to fit
model 7, in a Windows computer Intel(R) Core (TM) i7-4600 CPU with
2.1GHz and 2.7GHz, 8GB (RAM), using the parallel option with 4 cores,
was 23.04 hours.

# Summary

In conclusion, *addhaz* is a publicly available tool to assess the
contribution of chronic conditions to the disability prevalence, using
cross-sectional data. The results produced by the tool can be used by
policymakers to reduce the disability burden. Future areas of interest
to improve the package include the extension of the multinomial model to
ordinal responses and alternatives to reduce computation time for high
dimensional data.
