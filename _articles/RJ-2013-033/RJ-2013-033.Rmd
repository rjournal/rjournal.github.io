title: On Sampling from the Multivariate t Distribution
abstract: The multivariate normal and the multivariate t distributions belong to the
  most widely used multivariate distributions in statistics, quantitative risk management,
  and insurance. In contrast to the multivariate normal distribution, the parameterization
  of the multivariate t distribution does not correspond to its moments. This, paired
  with a non-standard implementation in the R package mvtnorm, provides traps for
  working with the multivariate t distribution. In this paper, common traps are clarified
  and corresponding recent changes to mvtnorm are presented.
