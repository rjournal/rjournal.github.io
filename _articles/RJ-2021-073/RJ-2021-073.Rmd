title: 'MatchThem:: Matching and Weighting after Multiple Imputation'
abstract: Balancing the distributions of the confounders across the exposure levels
  in an observational study through matching or weighting is an accepted method to
  control for confounding due to these variables when estimating the association between
  an exposure and outcome and reducing the degree of dependence on certain modeling
  assumptions. Despite the increasing popularity in practice, these procedures cannot
  be immediately applied to datasets with missing values. Multiple imputation of the
  missing data is a popular approach to account for missing values while preserving
  the number of units in the dataset and accounting for the uncertainty in the missing
  values. However, to the best of our knowledge, there is no comprehensive matching
  and weighting software that can be easily implemented with multiply imputed datasets.
  In this paper, we review this problem and suggest a framework to map out the matching
  and weighting of multiply imputed datasets to 5 actions as well as the best practices
  to assess balance in these datasets after matching and weighting. We also illustrate
  these approaches using a companion package for R, MatchThem.
