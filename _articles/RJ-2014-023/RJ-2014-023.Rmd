# Introduction

Repeatedly, when a system of differential equations is written down, it
cannot be solved analytically. This is particularly true in the
non-linear case, which unfortunately habitually arises when modelling
physical systems. As such, it is common that numerical integration is
the only way for a modeller to analyse the properties of their system.
Consequently, many software packages exist today to assist in this step.
In R, for example, the package
[*deSolve*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=deSolve) [@soetaert]
deals with many classes of differential equation. It allows users to
solve first-order stiff and non-stiff initial value problem ODEs, as
well as stiff and non-stiff delay differential equations (DDEs), and
differential algebraic equations (DAEs) up to index 3. Moreover, it can
tackle partial differential equations (PDEs) with the assistance
[*ReacTran*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=ReacTran) [@soetaert3].
For such PDE problems users also have available the package
[*rootSolve*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=rootSolve)
[@soetaert4], which is additionally particularly suited to analysing the
equilibrium of differential equations. Finally,
[*bvpSolve*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=bvpSolve) [@soetaert2]
can tackle boundary value problems of systems of ODEs, whilst
[*sde*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=sde) [@iacus] is available
for stochastic differential equations (SDEs). However, for autonomous
ODE systems in either one or two dimensions, phase plane methods, as
developed by mathematicians such as Henri Poincaré in the 19th Century
[@farlow], allow for a qualitative analysis of the system's properties
without the need for numerical integration. Specifically, it is usually
possible to determine the long-term behaviour of the system for any
initial condition, via a highly graphical procedure coupled with
algorithmic mathematical analysis.

As a result of these considerations, phase plane analysis is an
important device in any modeller's toolbox. It stands as a key technique
not only for mathematicians, but biologists, physicists and engineers
amongst others. See for example @jordan, @barnes, @choudhury, and
@mooney for descriptions of uses in various fields. Since the method is
extremely algorithmic in nature, software tools would clearly provide a
powerful system by which to execute the techniques. Despite this, few
programmes are available for implementing phase plane methods.
Presently, a programme entitled pplane that employs a simple GUI system
is available for Matlab [@matlab; @polking]. In addition, several java
applets are available across the internet for executing phase plane
methods. But, they vary widely in quality and often struggle when
confronted with complex systems, whilst they also provide no simple way
to export produced plots. Now, with R ever growing in popularity as an
open-source general purpose scientific computing lenguage, it is logical
that available code to implement phase plane methods would serve as a
valuable resource. The first attempts in this direction were implemented
by @kaplan at Macalester College who created several short programmes to
analyse two dimensional ODEs and provided several example systems.
[*phaseR*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=phaseR) extends their
initial ideas in order to create a complete package; one providing phase
plane novices with the opportunity for independent learning, instructors
with a useful package for practical sessions, and experienced modellers
with an easy means by which to produce quality plots.

Overall, *phaseR* maintains the original structure of Kaplan and Flath's
code; with key functions available for each of the steps of a full phase
plane analysis. Specifically, it can assist in identifying and
classifying equilibrium points, allows direction fields as well as
nullclines to be plotted, and allows trajectories to be added to plots
for user specified initial conditions. *phaseR*, however, extends the
functionality of the code to allow analysis of both one and two
dimensional systems, whilst also allowing for far greater control over
the final produced plot. Moreover, *phaseR* comes complete with an
extensive guide detailing the techniques of phase plane analysis, also
containing numerous examples and exercises. Finally, *phaseR* makes use
of available R packages for finding numerical solutions to ODEs in order
to ensure maximum stability of the required integration step. I will now
proceed by briefly reviewing the techniques of phase plane analysis,
before discussing the usage of the package through several examples.

# One dimensional autonomous ODE systems

Any one dimensional autonomous ODE, of a function $y=y(t)=y_t$, can be
written in the following form $$\frac{dy_t}{dt}=f\left(y_t\right).$$
Thus, autonomous systems are characterised by not explicitly depending
on the independent variable $t$. For such systems, phase plane analysis
begins by plotting at a range of values for both the dependent and the
independent variable, a small arrow indicating the rate of change of
$y_t$ as provided by the ODE. This plot, commonly referred to as the
direction field, is useful because solutions to the ODE must pass
through the arrows in a tangential manner. Therefore, once produced, it
provides an easy construction from which to draw trajectories for any
initial condition without the need to solve the ODE.

Following this, so-called equilibrium points are determined. Defined as
the points $y_*$ where $f\left(y_*\right)=0$, the reason for their name
is easy to see: beginning at such a point, because of the lack of
explicit dependence upon $t$ in $f$, means the solution will remain
there for all values of $t$. Moreover, these points are then classified
as either stable or unstable, depending upon whether solutions converge
towards, or diverge away, from them. Stability may here be determined
from a 'phase portrait plot' of $f\left(y_t\right)$ against $y_t$ ; on
which arrows are placed indicating the direction of change of $y_t$ with
$t$. Arrows pointing towards each other on either side of an equilibrium
point denote stability, whilst arrows pointing away from each other
indicate the presence of an unstable point. Alternatively, a Taylor
Series argument can be utilised to define a simple criterion. The
argument proceeds by supposing the system begins a small distance
$\delta_0$ away from the fixed point $y_*$, i. e. $y_0=y_*+\delta_0$.
Then, writing our general expression for $y_t$ as $y_t=y_*+\delta_t$, we
use the Taylor Series expansion of $f$ to form a differential equation
for how $\delta_t$ changes with $t$
$$f\left(y_*+\delta_t\right)=f\left(y_*\right)+\delta_t\frac{\partial f}{\partial y_t}\left(y_*\right)+o(\delta_t),$$
where we have assumed higher order terms are negligible. Recalling
$f\left(y_*\right)=0$, our ODE becomes $$\begin{aligned}
 \frac{d}{dt} f \left(y_*+\delta_t \right) &= \delta_t \frac{\partial f}{\partial y_t} \left(y_*\right),\\
 \Rightarrow \frac{d\delta_t}{dt} &= \delta_t \frac{\partial f}{\partial y_t} \left(y_*\right) = k \delta_t.
\end{aligned}$$ This autonomous ODE for $\delta_t$ can be solved easily
to give $\delta_t=\delta_0e^{kt}$. This analysis is useful to us since
stability can be determined based upon whether $\delta_t$ grows, or
decays, as $t$ increases, i. e. using the simple criterion
$$k=\frac{\partial f}{\partial y_t}\left(y_*\right)=
  \begin{cases}
    >0 & \quad\text{Stable,}\\
    <0 & \quad\text{Unstable}
  \end{cases}
.$$

# Two dimensional autonomous ODE systems

In the two dimensional case, for functions $x=x(t)=x_t$ and
$y=y(t)=y_t$, any autonomous ODE system can be written as
$$\frac{dx_t}{dt}=f\left(x_t,y_t\right),\;\frac{dy_t}{dt}=g\left(x_t,y_t\right).$$
Thus as before, these systems are characterised by a lack of explicit
dependence upon the independent variable $t$ in the functional forms of
$f$ and $g$.

The direction field, more commonly referred to here as the velocity
field, is again produced to provide a powerful way by which to plot
trajectories for any initial condition. However, here this is done so in
the $x_t$-$y_t$ plane, rather than that containing the independent
variable. This visualisation proves to be the best way by which to
examine an autonomous two dimensional system.

Commonly, to assist the plotting of the velocity field, nullclines are
first computed. These are defined as the location where
$f\left(x_t,y_t\right)=0$ or $g\left(x_t,y_t\right)=0$. Thus they define
the curves across which either $x_t$ or $y_t$ does not change in $t$.
Any velocity arrows produced will therefore either be perfectly
horizontal or vertical. Since a velocity field must vary continuously
across a particular nullcline, by the uniqueness of solutions to ODEs,
nullclines can be used to check that no arrows have been plotted
incorrectly.

As one would expect, equilibrium points retain their great importance in
two dimensions. Here, their definition generalises as the locations
$\left(x_*,y_*\right)$ where
$f\left(x_*,y_*\right)=g\left(x_*,y_*\right)=0$. Consequently, the
intersection of the $x_t$ and $y_t$ nullclines can be used to determine
their location. Stability here is defined in an analogous manner to the
one dimensional case, whilst a Taylor Series argument again allows the
formulation of a simple rule for determining said stability. As before,
it supposes that we have an equilibrium point, now given by
$\left(x_*,y_*\right)$, and that the system initially lies slightly away
from this point at $\left(x_*+\delta_0,y_*+\epsilon_0\right)$, and in
general we have
$\left(x_t,y_t\right)=\left(x_*+\delta_t,y_*+\epsilon_t\right)$. Then
using the Taylor expansion for $f$, the differential equation for $x_t$
becomes $$\begin{aligned}
 \frac{d\delta_t}{dt}&=f\left(x_*+\delta_t,y_*+\epsilon_t\right),\\
 &=f\left(x_*,y_*\right)+\delta_t\frac{\partial f}{\partial x_t}\left(x_*,y_*\right)+\epsilon_t\frac{\partial f}{\partial y_t}\left(x_*,y_*\right)+o(\delta_t)+o(\epsilon_t),\\
 &=\delta_t\frac{\partial f}{\partial x_t}\left(x_*,y_*\right)+\epsilon_t\frac{\partial f}{\partial y_t}\left(x_*,y_*\right)+o(\delta_t)+o(\epsilon_t).
\end{aligned}$$ Similarly, the differential equation for $y_t$ becomes
$$\frac{d\epsilon_t}{dt}=\delta_t\frac{\partial g}{\partial x_t}\left(x_*,y_*\right)+\epsilon_t\frac{\partial g}{\partial y_t}\left(x_*,y_*\right)+o(\delta_t)+o(\epsilon_t).$$
In both equations we have again assumed terms of second order and higher
are negligible. Now if we write this system in matrix form we acquire
$$\frac{d\boldsymbol{\delta}_t}{dt} = \left. \begin{pmatrix}
\frac{\partial f}{\partial x_t} & \frac{\partial f}{\partial y_t} \\[0.3em]
\frac{\partial g}{\partial x_t} & \frac{\partial g}{\partial y_t} \end{pmatrix} \right|_{(x_*,y_*)} \boldsymbol{\delta}_t = J\boldsymbol{\delta}_t.$$
Here $J$ is called the Jacobian of the system, and
$\boldsymbol{\delta}=\left(\delta,\epsilon\right)^\top$. It is
consideration of the characteristic equation of $J$, and the values of
its eigenvalues it provides, that allows equilibrium points to be
classified, not only as either stable or unstable, but also in to
sub-categories. Full details of this can be found in the guide that
accompanies *phaseR*, available in the documentation folder of its
installation. However, classification ultimately, and simply, depends
upon the values of the determinant and trace of $J$.

Thus, in both the one and two dimensional cases, phase plane methods
allow trajectories to be easily plotted, and the long-term behaviour of
a system identified by classifying the equilibria. We shall next see how
*phaseR* can be used to perform such analyses using several simple
commands.

# Key functions

*phaseR* employs six key functions for the employment of phase plane
analysis.

-   `flowField`: Plots the direction or velocity field of one or two
    dimensional autonomous ODE systems.

-   `nullclines`: Plots the nullclines of two dimensional autonomous ODE
    systems. Alternatively, it can be used to plot horizontal lines at
    equilibrium points for one dimensional autonomous ODE systems.

-   `numericalSolution`: For two dimensional systems, this function
    numerically solves the ODEs for a given initial condition via
    *deSolve*, and then plots the dependent variables against the
    independent variable. Thus, it behaves as a wrapper for the user to
    *deSolve*, allowing for easier implementation and subsequent
    plotting.

-   `phasePortrait`: For one dimensional autonomous ODEs, it plots the
    phase portrait i. e. the derivative against the dependent variable.
    In addition, it adds arrows to the dependent variable axis from
    which the stability of any equilibrium points can be determined.

-   `stability`: Classifies equilibrium points, using the criteria that
    result from the aforementioned Taylor Series arguments.

-   `trajectory`: Plots trajectories in the $x_t$-$y_t$ plane by
    performing numerical integration of the chosen ODE system, again via
    *deSolve*. Initial conditions can be specified as an argument, or by
    clicking with the cursor on locations in a pre-existing plot.

As an example, standard phase plane analyses for a two dimensional ODE
system would proceed by using `flowField`, `nullclines` and then
`trajectory` to create a summarising plot, and finally `stability` to
classify the equilibria.

# Example 1: logistic growth model

To describe how *phaseR* can be used to analyse a one dimensional
autonomous system of interest, we will consider the logistic growth
model. Originally proposed by @verhulst, this ODE is frequently used in
Biology to model the growth of a population under density dependence. It
is given in its most general case by
$$\frac{dy_t}{dt} = \beta y_t\left(1 - \frac{y_t}{K}\right).$$

To analyse any system using *phaseR*, a function must first be created
to return the value of the derivative at any point $\left(t,y\right)$,
in a style compatible with *deSolve*. For this model such a function is
already present in the package as `logistic`, which comprises the
following code

``` r
logistic <- function(t, y, parameters){
    beta <- parameters[1]
    K    <- parameters[2]
    dy   <- beta*y*(1 - y/K)
    list(dy)
}
```

The general format of this derivative function should be a common one:
given `t`, `y` and a vector `parameters`, it should simply return a list
with first element the value of the derivative.

With this, we can then proceed with our desired analysis. From here we
shall consider the particular case $beta=1$ and $K=2$. The following
code creates Figure [1](#figure:logistic); adding the direction field,
several trajectories and horizontal lines at any equilibrium points.

``` r
> logistic.flowField  <- 
+     flowField(logistic, x.lim = c(0, 5), y.lim = c(-1, 3), 
+               parameters = c(1, 2), points = 21, 
+               system = "one.dim", add = FALSE, xlab = "t")
> grid()
> logistic.nullclines <- 
+     nullclines(logistic, x.lim = c(0, 5), y.lim = c(-1, 3), 
+                parameters = c(1, 2), system = "one.dim")
> logistic.trajectory <- 
+     trajectory(logistic, y0 = c(-0.5, 0.5, 1.5, 2.5), t.end = 5, 
+                parameters = c(1, 2), system = "one.dim", colour = rep("black", 4))
```

![Figure 1: The direction field and several trajectories for the
logistic growth model with $\beta=1$ and $K=2$. It can be seen that two
equilibrium points have been located.](Logistic.png){#figure:logistic
width="100%" alt="graphic without alt text"}

Here we have tailored our result by setting a suitable range for the
dependent and independent variables, whilst by default suitable axes
labels have been added to the plot. These are just several input
variables that can be changed to suit the needs of your particular
system.

Now, we can observe from Figure [1](#figure:logistic) that two
equilibrium points have been identified; appearing to be $y_*=0$ and
$y_*=2$. We can confirm their location analytically however by setting
the right hand side of the ODE to zero $$\begin{aligned}
 y_* \left(1 - \frac{y_*}{2}\right) &= 0,\\
 \Rightarrow y_* &= \{0,\ 2\}.
\end{aligned}$$

It appears from the trajectories in Figure [1](#figure:logistic) that
the point $y_*=2$ is stable, and $y_*=0$ unstable. We can confirm this
by plotting the phase portrait with the following code, producing
Figure [2](#figure:phaseportrait)

``` r
> logistic.phasePortrait <- phasePortrait(logistic, y.lim = c(-0.5, 2.5),
+                                         parameters = c(1, 2), points = 10)
> grid()
```

![Figure 2: The phase portrait for the logistic growth model with
$\beta=1$ and $K=2$. The line y=0 has been identified as unstable, and the
line y=2 as stable.](PhasePortrait.png){#figure:phaseportrait
width="100%" alt="graphic without alt text"}

Alternatively, if we use our Taylor Series method we can draw this same
conclusion
$$\left.\frac{d}{dy}\left(\frac{dy}{dt}\right)\right|_{y=y_*} = 1 - y_* =
  \begin{cases}
    +1 & y_*=0,\\
    -1 & y_*=2
  \end{cases}.$$ Thus we have drawn the same conclusion; $y_*=0$ is
indeed unstable, and $y_*=2$ stable. The following code can perform this
analysis for us using `stability`

``` r
> logistic.stability.1 <- 
+     stability(logistic, y.star = 0, parameters = c(1, 2), system = "one.dim")

Discriminant: 1   Classification: Unstable

> logistic.stability.2 <- 
+     stability(logistic, y.star = 2, parameters = c(1, 2), system = "one.dim")

Discriminant: -1   Classification: Stable
```

This completes our phase plane analysis of the logistic growth model. We
have successfully identified that for this model, if $y_0>0$, which it
must be for the model to make physical sense, the system will eventually
approach the line $y_t=2$, regardless of the exact initial condition.
*phaseR* clearly provided a capacity by which to either check, or
perform, the analyses that would take time by hand using several short
lines of code.

# Example 2: Lotka-Volterra model

As an example of the capabilities of *phaseR* for a two dimensional
system, we will study a particular case of the Lotka-Volterra model
[@lotka; @volterra] for interacting predator and prey. This model can be
written in its general form as $$\begin{aligned}
 \frac{dx_t}{dt}&=\lambda x_t - \epsilon x_ty_t,\\
 \frac{dy_t}{dt}&=\eta x_ty_t - \delta y_t.
\end{aligned}$$

Again, we must first specify a derivative function. As before, this is
already provided in the package as `lotkaVolterra`, which consists of
the following code

``` r
lotkaVolterra <- function(t, y, parameters) {
    x <- y[1]
    y <- y[2]
    lambda  <- parameters[1]
    epsilon <- parameters[2]
    eta     <- parameters[3]
    delta   <- parameters[4]
    dy    <- numeric(2)
    dy[1] <- lambda*x - epsilon*x*y
    dy[2] <- eta*x*y - delta*y
    list(dy)
}
```

*deSolve* again requires us here to create a function taking values for
`t`, `y` and `parameters`, but here returning a list whose first element
is a vector of the two derivatives, and also accepting `y` as a vector
argument.

From here we shall focus on the particular case $\lambda=2$,
$\epsilon=1$, $\eta=3$ and $\delta=2$. We begin by determining the
nullclines; by setting the two derivatives to zero in turn, starting
with $x_t$
$$2x_t-x_ty_t=0 \Rightarrow x_t(2-y_t)=0 \Rightarrow x_t=0,\ y_t=2,$$
and then $y_t$
$$3x_ty_t-2y_t=0 \Rightarrow y_t(3x_t-2)=0 \Rightarrow y_t=0,\ x_t=2/3.$$

Requiring that both derivatives are zero identifies the equilibrium
points of the model; clearly given here by $(0,0)$ and $(2/3,2)$. To
classify them we turn to the Jacobian $$J = \begin{pmatrix}
2-y_* & -x_* \\
3y_* & 3x_*-2 \end{pmatrix}.$$ Thus for $(0,0)$; $\text{det}(J)=-4$,
which classifies the point as a saddle. Additionally, for $(2/3,2)$ we
have that $\text{det}(J)=4$, and $\text{tr}(J)=0$, which classifies the
point as a centre. Readers are again pointed to the package guide for
further details of classification using the Jacobian.

We can repeat all of the above analyses easily using *phaseR*; plotting
the nullclines along with the velocity field and several trajectories
with the following code that produces Figure [3](#figure:lotkavolterra)

``` r
> lotkaVolterra.flowField <- 
+     flowField(lotkaVolterra, x.lim = c(0, 5), y.lim = c(0, 10),
+               parameters = c(2, 1, 3, 2), points = 19, add = FALSE)
> grid()
> lotkaVolterra.nullclines <- 
+     nullclines(lotkaVolterra, x.lim = c(-1, 5), y.lim = c(-1, 10),
+                parameters = c(2, 1, 3, 2), points = 500)
> y0 <- matrix(c(1, 2, 2, 2, 3, 4), ncol = 2, nrow = 3, byrow = TRUE)
> lotkaVolterra.trajectory <- 
+     trajectory(lotkaVolterra, y0 = y0, t.end = 10, 
+                parameters = c(2, 1, 3, 2), colour = rep("black", 3))
```

![Figure 3: The velocity field, nullclines and several trajectories for
the Lotka-Volterra model with $\lambda=2$, $\epsilon=1$, $\eta=3$ and
$\delta=2$. Trajectories can be seen to traverse around the point
(2/3,2).](LotkaVolterra.png){#figure:lotkavolterra width="100%" alt="graphic without alt text"}

Finally, we can verify that our stability analysis was indeed correct

``` r
> lotkaVolterra.stability.1 <- 
+     stability(lotkaVolterra, y.star = c(0, 0), parameters = c(2, 1, 3, 2))

T: 0   Delta: -4   Discriminant: 16   Classification: Saddle

> lotkaVolterra.stability.2 <- 
+     stability(lotkaVolterra, y.star = c(2/3, 2), parameters = c(2, 1, 3, 2))

T: 0   Delta: 4   Discriminant: -16   Classification: Centre
```

Biologically, we have seen that no matter what the exact initial
starting values are, according to this model the numbers of predator and
prey will oscillate around the centre $(2/3,2)$. Alternatively, this
oscillation can be seen by plotting the dependent variables against the
independent using the following code, producing
Figure [4](#figure:numericalsolution)

``` r
> lotkaVolterra.numericalSolution <- 
+     numericalSolution(lotkaVolterra, y0 = c(3, 4), t.end = 10, type = "one",
+                       parameters = c(2, 1, 3, 2), colour = c("green", "orange"),
+                       ylab = "x, y", ylim = c(0, 10))
> legend("bottomright", col = c("green", "orange"), legend = c("x", "y"), lty = 1)
```

$\lambda=2$, $\epsilon=1$, $\eta=3$ and $\delta=2$ and
$\left(x_0,y_0\right)=(3,4)$. The number of each species can be seen to
oscillate.](NumericalSolution.png){#figure:numericalsolution

This concludes our analysis of this two dimensional system. Again
*phaseR* allowed for the phase plane analysis to be performed quickly
and easily, bypassing the time consuming process of drawing by hand.

# Concluding remarks and future developments

Rarely can a system of differential equations be solved in closed form.
Consequently, numerical solutions are often required and therefore much
theory exists around integration techniques for each class of
differential equations. In R many of these methods have been implemented
in packages such as *deSolve*, *bvpSolve*, *sde*, *ReacTran* and
*rootSolve*. Between them, these packages allow modellers to deal with
many classes of ODEs, DDEs, DAEs, SDEs and PDEs. However, for a one or
two dimensional system of autonomous ODEs, an alternative approach to
direct numerical solution is available. This so-called phase plane
analysis allows much important inference to be made about the system
using relatively simplistic graphical and mathematical techniques. The
algorithmic nature of the phase plane approach lends itself well to
software tools, and *phaseR* provides the first such complete package in
R for its implementation. I have demonstrated how *phaseR* allows users
to easily perform this qualitative analysis with little initial system
set-up, and few commands for execution, required. Sometimes, phase plane
analysis is criticised on two grounds; that it is limited to systems of
two or less dimension [@mutambara], and that it is highly labour
intensive. Whilst the former still stands, and thus only problems that
can be at least well approximated by a second order system may be
analysed using the methods discussed above, the latter issue is at least
relieved further by the creation of *phaseR*. Whilst to provide greater
detail on the dimensional limitation future development of the package
will seek to incorporate further example systems from nature, including
approximation techniques for higher order problems. In addition, package
development will see the one dimensional tools extended to
non-autonomous ODEs. Therefore, given all these considerations, in
conjunction with the extensive accompanying guide describing in
increased detail both the above techniques and providing many worked
examples and exercises, *phaseR* should hopefully serve as a useful
package for both independent and group led learning, as well as for
those simply seeking to produce high-quality figures.
