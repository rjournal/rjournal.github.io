title: 'phaseR: An R Package for Phase Plane Analysis of Autonomous ODE Systems'
abstract: 'When modelling physical systems, analysts will frequently be confronted
  by differential equations which cannot be solved analytically. In this instance,
  numerical integration will usually be the only way forward. However, for autonomous
  systems of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) in one or two dimensions, it is
  possible to employ an instructive qualitative analysis foregoing this requirement,
  using so-called phase plane methods. Moreover, this qualitative analysis can even
  prove to be highly useful for systems that can be solved analytically, or will be
  solved numerically anyway. The package phaseR allows the user to perform such phase
  plane analyses: determining the stability of any equilibrium points easily, and
  producing informative plots.'
