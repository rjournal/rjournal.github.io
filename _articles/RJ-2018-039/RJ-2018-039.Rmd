title: dimRed and coRanking - Unifying Dimensionality Reduction in R
abstract: “Dimensionality reduction” (DR) is a widely used approach to find low dimensional
  and interpretable representations of data that are natively embedded in high-dimensional
  spaces. DR can be realized by a plethora of methods with different properties, objectives,
  and, hence, (dis)advantages. The resulting low-dimensional data embeddings are often
  difficult to compare with objective criteria. Here, we introduce the dimRed and
  coRanking packages for the R language. These open source software packages enable
  users to easily access multiple classical and advanced DR methods using a common
  interface. The packages also provide quality indicators for the embeddings and easy
  visualization of high dimensional data. The coRanking package provides the functionality
  for assessing DR methods in the co-ranking matrix framework. In tandem, these packages
  allow for uncovering complex structures high dimensional data. Currently 15 DR methods
  are available in the package, some of which were not previously available to R users.
  Here, we outline the dimRed and coRanking packages and make the implemented methods
  understandable to the interested reader.
