title: 'diproperm: An R Package for the DiProPerm Test'
abstract: High-dimensional low sample size (HDLSS) data sets frequently emerge in
  many biomedical applications. The direction-projection-permutation (DiProPerm) test
  is a two-sample hypothesis test for comparing two high-dimensional distributions.
  The DiProPerm test is exact, i.e., the type I error is guaranteed to be controlled
  at the nominal level for any sample size, and thus is applicable in the HDLSS setting.
  This paper discusses the key components of the DiProPerm test, introduces the diproperm
  R package, and demonstrates the package on a real-world data set.
