# Introduction

Advancements in modern technology and computer software have
dramatically increased the demand and feasibility to collect
high-dimensional data sets. Such data introduce analytical challenges
which require the creation of new and adaptation of existing statistical
methods. One such challenge is that we may observe many more covariates
(features) $p$ than the number of observations $N$, especially in small
sample size studies. These data structures are known as
high-dimensional, low sample size (HDLSS) data sets, or "small $N$, big
$p$."

HDLSS data frequently occur in many health-related fields. For example,
in genomic studies, a single microarray experiment can produce tens of
thousands of gene expressions compared to the few samples studied, often
being less than a hundred [@Alag:2019]. In medical imaging studies, a
single region of interest for analysis in an MRI or CT-scan image often
contains thousands of features compared to the small number of samples
studied [@Limkin:2017]. In the pre-clinical evaluation of vaccines and
other experimental therapeutic agents, the number of biomarkers measured
(e.g., immune responses) may be much greater than the number of samples
studied (e.g., mice, rabbits, or non-human primates) [@Kimball:2018].

One common task in the HDLSS setting entails comparing the distribution
of covariates between two groups (classes). For example, in pre-clinical
studies of vaccines, investigators may wish to compare the distribution
of biomarkers between animals who survive to a certain time point and
animals who do not survive. In the example presented below, the
distribution of $p=112$ covariates is compared between edible and
poisonous mushrooms. The covariate distributions may be compared between
two samples using the direction-projection-permutation (DiProPerm) test
[@Wei:2016]. This test is well-suited for the HDLSS setting because the
test is exact, i.e., the type I error is guaranteed to be controlled at
the nominal level for any sample size. Below we discuss the key
components of the DiProPerm test, introduce the
[*diproperm*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=diproperm) R package,
and demonstrate the use of the package on a real-world data set.

# DiProPerm Test

To compare the distribution of covariates between two groups, the
DiProPerm tests use one-dimensional projections of the data based on a
binary linear classifier to construct a univariate test statistic and
then permutes class labels to determine the sampling distribution of the
test statistic under the null. The details of the DiProPerm test are as
follows.

Let $X_{1}, \ldots ,X_{n} \sim F_{1}$ and
$Y_{1}, \ldots ,Y_{m} \sim F_{2}$ be independent random samples of $p$
dimensional random vectors from multivariate distributions $F_{1}$ and
$F_{2}$ where $p$ may be larger than $m$ and $n$. The DiProPerm test
evaluates the hypotheses
$$H_{0}:F_{1}=F_{2} \text{ \  versus \  } H_{1}:F_{1} \neq F_{2}$$
The test entails three steps:

1.  Direction:  find the normal vector to the separating hyperplane
    between two samples after training a binary linear classifier

2.  Projection:  project data on to the normal vector and calculate a
    univariate two-sample statistic

3.  Permutation:  conduct a permutation test using the univariate
    statistic as follows:

    1.  Permute class membership after pooling samples

    2.  Re-train binary classifier and find the normal vector to the
        separating hyperplane

    3.  Recalculate the univariate two sample statistic

    4.  Repeat a-c multiple times (say 1000) to determine the sampling
        distribution of the test statistic under the null $H_{0}$

    5.  Compute *p*-value by comparing the observed statistic to the
        sampling distribution

Different binary linear classifiers may be used in the first step of
DiProPerm. Linear discriminant analysis (LDA), particularly after
conducting principal component analysis (PCA), is one possible
classifier for the direction step. However, using LDA with PCA in the
HDLSS setting has some disadvantages, including lack of
interpretability, sensitivity to outliers, and tendency to find spurious
linear combinations due to a phenomenon known as data piling
[@Aoshima:2018; @Marron:2007]. Data piling occurs if data are projected
onto some projection direction, and many of the projections are the same
or piled on one another. The support vector machine (SVM) is another
popular classifier [@Hastie:2001]. The SVM finds the hyperplane that
maximizes the minimum distance between data points and the separating
hyperplane. However, the SVM can also suffer from data piling in the
HDLSS setting. To overcome data piling, the distance weighted
discrimination (DWD) classifier was developed [@Marron:2007].  The DWD
classifier finds the separating hyperplane minimizing the average
inverse distance between data points and the hyperplane. The DWD
performs well in HDLSS settings with good separation and is more robust
to data piling.

In the second step of DiProPerm, a univariate statistic is calculated
using the projected values onto the normal vector to the separating
hyperplane from the first step. Suppose $x_{1}, \ldots ,x_{n}$ and
$y_{1}, \ldots ,y_{m}$ are the projected values from samples
$X_{1}, \ldots ,X_{n}$ and $Y_{1}, \ldots ,Y_{m}$, respectively. One
common choice for the univariate test statistic for DiProPerm includes
the difference of means statistic, $|\bar{x}-\bar{y}|$. Other two-sample
univariate statistics such as the two-sample t-statistic or difference
in medians are also possible for use with the DiProPerm. 

The last step of DiProPerm entails determining the distribution of the
test statistic under the null. In this step, the two samples are pooled,
class labels are permuted, then a univariate statistic is calculated.
Repeat this process multiple times (say 1000) to determine the sampling
distribution of the test statistic under the null $H_{0}$. P-values are
then calculated by the proportion of statistics higher than the original
value.

When the DiProPerm test is implemented using the DWD classifier, it is
common practice to look at the loadings of the DWD classifier
[@An:2016; @Nelson:2019].  The DWD loadings represent the relative
contribution of each variable to the class difference. A higher absolute
value of a variable's loading indicates a greater contribution for that
variable to the class difference. The loadings vector is a unit vector;
thus, the individual loadings range from -1 to 1, and the sum of the
squares of the loadings equals one. The loadings direction vector points
from the negative to positive class. Thus, positive entries correspond
to variables that tend to be larger for the positive class. Combining
the use of the DiProPerm and evaluation of the DWD loadings in
applications can provide insights into high-dimensional data and be used
to generate rational hypotheses for future research.

The DiProPerm test has been used in several areas of biomedical
research, including osteoarthritis and neuroscience
[@An:2016; @Bendich:2016; @Nelson:2019]. However, currently, there does
not exist an R package that implements DiProPerm. Therefore we developed
[*diproperm*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=diproperm), a free,
publicly available R software package to analyze data from two
high-dimensional distributions [@dipropermPackage]. Functions in the
[*diproperm*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=diproperm) package
allow users to conduct the DiProPerm test and create corresponding
diagnostic plots. Loadings for the binary linear classifier are also
available for display in order from highest to lowest relative to their
contribution toward the separation of the two distributions.

# Package Overview

The [*diproperm*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=diproperm) package
is comprised of three functions:

-   `DiProPerm()`: Conducts the DiProPerm test
-   `plotdpp()`: Plots diagnostics from the DiProPerm test
-   `loadings()`: Returns the variable indices with the highest loadings
    in the binary classification. The absolute values of the loading
    values indicate a variable's relative contribution toward the
    separation between the two classes. The loadings vector is a unit
    vector, thus, the sum of its squares must be equal to one and range
    from -1 to 1. Also, the loadings direction vector points from the
    negative to positive class. Thus, positive entries correspond to
    variables that are larger for the positive class.

The [*diproperm*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=diproperm) package
can be installed from CRAN using the code in the 'Example' section
below. Additionally, the development version of the package can be
installed from GitHub (\"allmondrew/diproperm\").

## Example

The example below creates a Gaussian data set containing 100 samples, 2
features, clustered around 2 centers with a standard deviation of 2. The
class labels are then re-classified to -1 and 1 to match the input
requirements of `DiProPerm()`. The DiProPerm test is then conducted
using the DWD classifier, the mean difference univariate statistic, and
1000 permutations. The results from `DiProPerm()` are then displayed
with `plotdpp()`. Last, the top five indices of the highest absolute
loadings are listed.

``` r
  install.packages("diproperm")
  remotes::install_github("elbamos/clusteringdatasets")
  library(diproperm)
  library(clusteringdatasets)
    
  cluster.data <- make_blobs(n_samples = 100, n_features = 2, centers = 2, cluster_std = 2)
    
  X <- cluster.data[[1]]
  y <- cluster.data[[2]]
  y[y==2] <- -1
    
  dpp <- DiProPerm(X,y,B=1000,classifier = "dwd",univ.stat = "md")

  plotdpp(dpp)
    
  loadings(dpp,loadnum = 5)
```

## Description

The main function to be called first by the user is `DiProPerm()`, which
takes in an $n \times p$ data matrix and a vector of $n$ binary class
labels both provided by the user. Factor variables for the data matrix
must be coded as 0/1 dummy variables, and the class labels for the
vector of binary class labels must be coded as -1 and 1. By default, the
`DiProPerm()` uses the DWD classifier, the mean difference as the
univariate statistics, and 1000 balanced permutations. The permutations
are balanced in the sense that after relabeling, the new -1 group
contains $n/2$ members from the original -1 group and $n/2$ members not
from the original -1 group. Users can also implement an unbalanced,
randomized permutation design if desired. `DiProPerm()` implements DWD
from the `genDWD` function in the
[*DWDLargeR*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=DWDLargeR) package
[@DWDLargeRPackage; @Lam:2018]. The penalty parameter, `C`, in the
`genDWD` function is calculated using the `penaltyParameter` function in
[*DWDLargeR*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=DWDLargeR).
[*DWDLargeR*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=DWDLargeR) has several
parameters which are set to recommended default values. More details on
the algorithm used to compute `genDWD` and `penaltyParameter` can be
found in @Lam:2018. Other options included in `DiProPerm()` for the
binary linear classifier are the mean difference direction "md" and
support vector machine "svm". `DiProPerm()` uses parallel processing to
delegate computation to the number of cores on the user's computer for
increased efficiency. `DiProPerm()` returns a list of the observed data
matrix, vector of observed class labels, observed test statistic,
projection scores used to compute the observed test statistic, the
loadings of the binary classification, the z-score, cutoff value for an
$\alpha$ level of significance, the *p*-value for the DiProPerm test, a
list of each permutation's projection scores and permuted class labels,
and a vector of permuted test statistics the size of the number of
permutations used.

After calling `DiProPerm()`, the function `plotdpp()` can be used to
create a panel plot for assessing the diagnostics of the DiProPerm test.
`plotdpp()` takes in a DiProPerm list and the user may specify which
diagnostics they would like to display. By default, `plotdpp()` displays
a facet plot with the observed score distribution, the projection score
distribution of the permutation with the smallest test statistic value,
the projection score distribution of the permutation with the largest
test statistic value, and the test statistic permutation distribution.
For the permutation distribution plot, the z-score, cutoff value,
observed test statistic and *p*-value are displayed on the graph. Larger
individual graphs may be displayed by using the plots option in
`plotdpp()`. Additional graphs include the projection score
distributions for the first and second permutations. The diagnostic
plots show the user the characteristics of their data and facilitate the
visual assessment of the separation of the two high-dimensional
distributions being tested.

Lastly, after calling the `DiProPerm()`, the user may call the
`loadings()` function. The `loadings()` function returns the variable
indices in the data matrix which have the highest absolute loadings in
the binary classification. Because the loadings vector is a unit vector,
the sum of the squares of loadings is constrained to equal to one, with
each loading between -1 to 1. The loadings direction vector points from
the negative to the positive class. Thus, positive entries correspond to
variables that tend to be larger for the positive class. Higher absolute
loading values indicate a greater contribution for a particular variable
toward the separation between the two classes. By default, `loadings()`
returns the indices for all variables sorted by their absolute loading
value. Therefore, the top variable index is the variable which
contributes the most toward the separation of the two classes, and the
last variable is the one which contributes the least. The user may also
change the number of loadings displayed.

# Application

To illustrate the use of the
[*diproperm*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=diproperm) package,
consider the mushrooms data set, which is freely available from the UCI
Machine Learning Repository [@Dua:2019] and within
[*diproperm*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=diproperm). This data
set includes various characterizations of $23$ species of gilled
mushrooms in the Agaricus and Lepiota families. Each mushroom species is
labeled as either definitely edible or poisonous/unknown. There are
$n=8124$ mushrooms in total, and $p=112$ binary covariates coded as 0/1
corresponding to 22 categorical attributes. Below, we demonstrate the
[*diproperm*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=diproperm) package
functionality using data from the first $n=50$ mushrooms in the data
set.

## Step 1: Load and clean the data

``` r
  install.packages("diproperm")
  library(diproperm)
  data(mushrooms)
```

The above code installs the
[*diproperm*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=diproperm) package and
loads the mushroom data into R. Now, let us check the structure of the
data to make sure it is compatible with `DiProPerm()`.

``` r
  dim(mushrooms$X)
      [1] 112 8124
  
  table(mushrooms$y)
      -1 1
      4208 3916
```

The vector of class labels must be -1 or 1 for `DiProPerm()`, which is
the case for this data. However, the data set is in $p \times n$
 format. For `DiProPerm()`, the dataset must be in $n \times p$
 format. This can be done using the transpose function from the
[*Matrix*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=Matrix) package in R
[@MatrixPackage]. After taking the transpose, we subset the data and
vector of class labels to the first 50 observations and store the
results.

``` r
  X <- Matrix::t(mushrooms$X)
  X <- X[1:50,]
  y <- mushrooms$y[1:50]
```

## Step 2: Conduct DiProPerm

Now, that the data is in the proper format the call to `DiProPerm()` is
as follows:

``` r
  dpp <- DiProPerm(X=X,y=y,B=1000)
  
      Algorithm stopped with error 2.35e-08
      sample size =  50, feature dimension = 112
      positve sample =  12, negative sample =  38
      number of iterations =  51
      time taken = 0.10
```

Characteristics of the DWD algorithm used to find the solution for the
observed data are displayed by `DiProPerm()`. The algorithm took 51
iterations and 0.10 seconds to converge to the tolerance threshold with
a zero percent classification error on the training data set. The
runtime for 1000 permutations was less than 3 minutes on a four-core
machine but would be faster on a machine with more cores. The `dpp`
object stores the output list from `DiProPerm()` described in the
package. Storing the information allows us to plot the diagnostics in
the next step. 

## Step 3: Plot diagnostics

``` r
  plotdpp(dpp)
```

![Figure 1: The diagnostic plot from `plotdpp()` for the mushrooms data
set. The top graph is the observed projection score distribution of the
two classes, the two middle graphs are the projection score
distributions of the permutation with the smallest and largest test
statistic value, and the bottom graph is the test statistic permutation
distribution with the observed statistic value marked by the red dotted
line.](Figure-1.png){#figure:plotdpp width="100%"
alt="graphic without alt text"}

Figure [1](#figure:plotdpp) displays the default diagnostics for a
DiProPerm list. From the observed projection score distribution, one can
see clear separation between the two classes.  Also, from the projected
score distributions of the permutations, which yield the smallest and
largest test statistic, we see the score distributions overlap well, so
there is some visual justification that the distributions in the
observed plot are truly different. Lastly, the bottom plot shows the
sampling distribution under the null is located around 0.4 while the
observed test statistic is greater than 2. Each individual plot can also
be output by the following set of commands:

``` r
  plotdpp(dpp,plots="obs")
  plotdpp(dpp,plots="min")
  plotdpp(dpp,plots="max")
  plotdpp(dpp,plots="permdist")
```

The permutation *p*-value in Figure [1](#figure:plotdpp) suggests that
the two high-dimensional distributions of mushroom attributes are indeed
different between the two classes. Also displayed is a z-score,
calculated by fitting a Gaussian distribution to the test statistic
permutation distribution. The mushroom data z-score 12.9 indicates the
observed test statistic is approximately 13 standard deviations from the
expected value of the test statistic under the null. Finally, the cutoff
value 0.697 is displayed, corresponding to the critical value for a
hypothesis test at the 0.05 significance level.

## Step 4: Examine loadings

In order to assess which variables contributed most toward the
separation in step 3, we can print the top five contributors with the
code

``` r
  loadings(dpp,loadnum = 5)
  
      index sorted_loadings
      29    0.5395016
      37    0.3170037
      36    -0.2481763
      111   0.2228389
      20    -0.2087244
```

The top five contributors toward the separation seen in the observed
distribution in Figure [1](#figure:plotdpp) are indices 29, 37, 36, 111,
and 20. These indices correspond to a pungent odor, narrow gill size,
broad gill size, urban habitat, and yellow cap color, respectively. For
these data, $y = 1$ corresponds to poisonous and $y = -1$ to edible;
thus, loadings with positive entries, such as pungent odor, are
indicative of poisonous mushrooms. These results are similar to previous
analyses, which have also found odor, gill size, habitat, and cap color
predictive of mushroom edibility [@Pinky2019; @Wibowo2018].

# Summary

DiProPerm is an exact test for comparing two high-dimensional
distributions. The
[*diproperm*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=diproperm) package
allows the user to visually assess and conduct a DiProPerm test to
determine if there is a difference between the high-dimensional
distributions of two classes and, if so, evaluate the key features
contributing to the separation between the classes.
