title: Testing the Equality of Normal Distributed and Independent Groups' Means Under
  Unequal Variances by doex Package
abstract: ' In this paper, we present the [doex](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=doex)
  package contains the tests for equality of normal distributed and independent group
  means under unequal variances such as Cochran F, Welch-Aspin, Welch, Box, Scott-Smith,
  Brown-Forsythe, Johansen F, Approximate F, Alexander-Govern, Generalized F, Modified
  Brown-Forsythe, Permutation F, Adjusted Welch, B2, Parametric Bootstrap, Fiducial
  Approach, and Alvandi Generalized F-test. Most of these tests are not available
  in any package. Thus, doex is easy to use for researchers in multidisciplinary studies.
  In this study, an extensive Monte-Carlo simulation study is conducted to investigate
  the performance of the the tests for equality of normal distributed group means
  under unequal variances'
