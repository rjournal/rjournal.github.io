title: Two-Stage Sampling Design and Sample Selection with the R Package R2BEAT
abstract: |
  R2BEAT ("R 'to' Bethel Extended Allocation for Two-stage sampling")
  is an R package for the optimal allocation of a sample. Its
  peculiarity lies in properly addressing allocation problems for
  two-stage and complex sampling designs with multi-domain and
  multi-purpose aims. This is common in many official and non-official
  statistical surveys, therefore R2BEAT could become an essential tool
  for planning a sample survey. The functions implemented in R2BEAT
  allow the use of different workflows, depending on the available
  information on one or more interest variables. The package covers all
  the phases, from the optimization of the sample to the selection of
  the Primary and Secondary Stage Units. Furthermore, it provides
  several outputs for evaluating the allocation results.
