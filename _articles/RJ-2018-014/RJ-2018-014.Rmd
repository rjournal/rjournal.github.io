title: Generalized Additive Model Multiple Imputation by Chained Equations With Package
  ImputeRobust
abstract: Data analysis, common to all empirical sciences, often requires complete
  data sets. Unfortu nately, real world data collection will usually result in data
  values not being observed. We present a package for robust multiple imputation (the
  ImputeRobust package) that allows the use of generalized additive models for location,
  scale, and shape in the context of chained equations. The paper describes the basics
  of the imputation technique which builds on a semi-parametric regression model (GAMLSS)
  and the algorithms and functions provided with the corresponding package. Furthermore,
  some illustrative examples are provided.
