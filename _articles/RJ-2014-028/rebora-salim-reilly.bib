  abstract =	 {$B$-splines are attractive for nonparametric
                  modelling, but choosing the optimal number and
                  positions of knots is a complex task. Equidistant
                  knots can be used, but their small and discrete
                  number allows only limited control over smoothness
                  and fit. We propose to use a relatively large number
                  of knots and a difference penalty on coefficients of
                  adjacent $B$-splines. We show connections to the
                  familiar spline penalty on the integral of the
                  squared second derivative. A short overview of
                  $B$-splines, of their construction and of penalized
                  likelihood is presented. We discuss properties of
                  penalized $B$-splines and propose various criteria
                  for the choice of an optimal penalty
                  parameter. Nonparametric logistic regression,
                  density estimation and scatterplot smoothing are
                  used as examples. Some details of the computations
                  are presented.},
