title: 'bshazard: A Flexible Tool for Nonparametric Smoothing of the Hazard Function'
abstract: The hazard function is a key component in the inferential process in survival
  analysis and relevant for describing the pattern of failures. However, it is rarely
  shown in research papers due to the difficulties in nonparametric estimation. We
  developed the bshazard package to facilitate the computation of a nonparametric
  estimate of the hazard function, with data-driven smoothing. The method accounts
  for left truncation, right censoring and possible covariates. B-splines are used
  to estimate the shape of the hazard within the generalized linear mixed models framework.
  Smoothness is controlled by imposing an autoregressive structure on the baseline
  hazard coefficients. This perspective allows an ’automatic’ smoothing by avoiding
  the need to choose the smoothing parameter, which is estimated from the data as
  a dispersion parameter. A simulation study demonstrates the capability of our software
  and an application to estimate the hazard of Non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma in Swedish population
  data shows its potential.
