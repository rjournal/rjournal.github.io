title: 'Coordinate-Based Meta-Analysis of fMRI Studies with R '
abstract: This paper outlines how to conduct a simple meta-analysis of neuroimaging
  foci of activation in R. In particular, the first part of this paper reviews the
  nature of fMRI data, and briefly overviews the existing packages that can be used
  to analyze fMRI data in R. The second part illustrates how to handle fMRI data by
  showing how to visualize the results of different neuroimaging studies in a so-called
  orthographic view, where the spatial distribution of the foci of activation from
  different fMRI studies can be inspected visually. Functional MRI (fMRI) is one of
  the most important and powerful tools of neuroscientific research. Although not
  as commonly used for fMRI analysis as some specific applications such as SPM (Friston
  et al., 2006), AFNI (Cox and Hyde, 1997), or FSL (Smith et al., 2004), R does provide
  several packages that can be employed in neuroimaging research. These packages deal
  with a variety of topics, ranging from reading and manipulating fMRI datasets, to
  implementing sophisticated statistical models. The goal of this paper is to provide
  a brief introduction to fMRI analysis, and the various R packages that can be used
  to carry it out. As an example, it will show how to use simple R commands to read
  fMRI images and plot results from previous studies, which can then be visually compared.
  This is a special form of meta-analysis, and a common way to compare results from
  the existing literature.
