title: 'spcadjust: An R Package for Adjusting for Estimation Error in Control Charts'
abstract: In practical applications of control charts the in-control state and the
  corresponding chart parameters are usually estimated based on some past in-control
  data. The estimation error then needs to be accounted for. In this paper we present
  an R package, spcadjust, which implements a bootstrap based method for adjusting
  monitoring schemes to take into account the estimation error. By bootstrapping the
  past data this method guarantees, with a certain probability, a conditional performance
  of the chart. In spcadjust the method is implement for various types of Shewhart,
  CUSUM and EWMA charts, various performance criteria, and both parametric and non-parametric
  bootstrap schemes. In addition to the basic charts, charts based on linear and logistic
  regression models for risk adjusted monitoring are included, and it is easy for
  the user to add further charts. Use of the package is demonstrated by examples.
