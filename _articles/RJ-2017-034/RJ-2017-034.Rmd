title: 'anchoredDistr: a Package for the Bayesian Inversion of Geostatistical Parameters
  with Multi-type and Multi-scale Data'
abstract: The Method of Anchored Distributions (MAD) is a method for Bayesian inversion
  designed for inferring both local (e.g. point values) and global properties (e.g.
  mean and variogram parameters) of spatially heterogenous fields using multi-type
  and multi-scale data. Software implementations of MAD exist in C++ and C# to import
  data, execute an ensemble of forward model simulations, and perform basic post-processing
  of calculating likelihood and posterior distributions for a given application. This
  article describes the R package anchoredDistr that has been built to provide an
  R based environment for this method. In particular, anchoredDistr provides a range
  of post-processing capabilities for MAD software by taking advantage of the statistical
  capabilities and wide use of the R language. Two examples from stochastic hydrogeology
  are provided to highlight the features of the package for MAD applications in inferring
  anchored distributions of local parameters (e.g. point values of transmissivity)
  as well as global parameters (e.g. the mean of the spatial random function for hydraulic
  conductivity).
