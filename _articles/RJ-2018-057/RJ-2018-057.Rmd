title: 'testforDEP: An R Package for Modern Distribution-free Tests and Visualization
  Tools for Independence'
abstract: This article introduces testforDEP, a portmanteau R package implementing
  for the first time several modern tests and visualization tools for independence
  between two variables. While classical tests for independence are in the base R
  packages, there have been several recently developed tests for independence that
  are not available in R. This new package combines the classical tests including
  Pearson’s product moment correlation coefficient method, Kendall’s τ rank correlation
  coefficient method and Spearman’s ρ rank correlation coefficient method with modern
  tests consisting of an empirical likelihood based test, a density-based empirical
  likelihood ratio test, Kallenberg data driven test, maximal information coefficient
  test, Hoeffding’s independence test and the continuous analysis of variance test.
  For two input vectors of observations, the function testforDEP provides a common
  interface for each of the tests and returns test statistics, corresponding p values
  and bootstrap confidence intervals as output. The function AUK provides an interface
  to visualize Kendall plots and computes the area under the Kendall plot similar
  to computing the area under a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve.
