title: Normal Tolerance Interval Procedures in the *tolerance* Package
abstract: Statistical tolerance intervals are used for a broad range of applications,
  such as quality control, engineering design tests, environmental monitoring, and
  bioequivalence testing. *tolerance* is the only R package devoted to procedures
  for tolerance intervals and regions. Perhaps the most commonly-employed functions
  of the package involve normal tolerance intervals. A number of new procedures for
  this setting have been included in recent versions of *tolerance*. In this paper,
  we discuss and illustrate the functions that implement these normal tolerance interval
  procedures, one of which is a new, novel type of operating characteristic curve.

# Introduction and overview of the *tolerance* package

Statistical tolerance intervals of the form $(1-\alpha,P)$ provide
bounds to capture at least a specified proportion $P$ of the sampled
population with a given confidence level $1-\alpha$. The quantity $P$ is
called the content of the tolerance interval and the confidence level
$1-\alpha$ reflects the sampling variability. There is an extensive
literature on tolerance intervals with some of the earliest works being
[@wilks41; @wilks42] and [@wald]. The texts by [@guttman] and
[@krishmat] are devoted to the theoretical development and application
of tolerance intervals, while the text by [@hahn] discusses their
application in the broader context of statistical intervals.

[*tolerance*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=tolerance) [@tolerance]
is a popular R package for constructing exact and approximate tolerance
intervals and regions. Since its initial release in 2009, the package
has grown to include tolerance interval procedures for a large number of
parametric distributions, nonparametric settings, and regression models.
There are also tolerance region procedures for the multivariate normal
and multivariate regression settings. Procedures for more specific
settings are also included, such as one-sided tolerance limits for the
difference between two independent normal random variables [@hall] and
fiducial tolerance intervals for the function of parameters from
discrete distributions [@matyoung]. The package also includes some
graphical capabilities for visualizing the tolerance intervals (regions)
by plotting the limits (regions) on histograms, scatterplots, or control
charts of the data.

*tolerance* has been used for a broad range of applications, including
cancer research [@heck], wildlife biology [@pas], assessing the
performance of genetic algorithms [@van], ratio editing in surveys
[@youngmat], air quality assessment [@haf], and instrumentation testing
[@burr]. General interest in *tolerance* can be gauged by the
[*cranlogs*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=cranlogs) package
[@cranlogs2], which pulls download logs of the RStudio [@RStudio] CRAN
mirror. Figure [1](#download) shows the daily number of downloads of
*tolerance* from the beginning of 2013 to the beginning of 2016. There
is clearly a general increasing trend over the years as the average
number of daily downloads per year is approximately 5, 10, and 15 in
2013, 2014, and 2015, respectively.

Capabilities of *tolerance* have been discussed in @tolerance
[@younghost]. Even with those varied capabilities, perhaps the most
commonly used methods involve the normal distribution. Normal tolerance
intervals are often required during design verification or process
validation. The utility of normal tolerance intervals is further
highlighted in documents published by the EPA [@EPA], the IAEA [@IAEA],
and standard 16269-6 of the ISO [@ISO]. In this paper, we discuss new
capabilities in *tolerance* specifically involving normal tolerance
intervals. This includes the calculation of exact and equal-tailed
normal tolerance intervals, Bayesian normal tolerance intervals,
tolerance intervals for fixed-effects ANOVA, and sample size
determination strategies. We also introduce novel pseudo-operating
characteristic (OC) curves that illustrate how the $k$-factor, sample
size, confidence level, and content level each change relative to one
another. Such curves can be useful for planning design tests.

CRAN mirror over a three-year time span

As noted earlier, *tolerance* also includes a function for constructing
multivariate normal tolerance regions. The `mvtol.region()` function was
included with the initial release of *tolerance*. `mvtol.region()`
includes several Monte Carlo procedures developed in @krishmatmv and
@krishmon for finding the $k$-factor of the multivariate normal
tolerance region. The `plottol()` function can also be used to plot
tolerance ellipses over bivariate normal data and tolerance ellipsoids
over trivariate normal data. The latter is accomplished using `plot3d()`
from the [*rgl*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=rgl) package [@rgl].
We will not discuss the `mvtol.region()` function further since it is
already well-documented [@tolerance; @younghost] and our present focus
is on newer capabilities in *tolerance* for normal tolerance intervals.

For our discussion, we assume that the reader has already installed and
loaded *tolerance* using the usual commands:

``` r
> install.packages("tolerance")
> library(tolerance)
```

# Normal tolerance intervals - classical and Bayesian {#TIs}

Let $\textbf{X}=(X_1,X_2,\ldots,X_n)$ be a random sample of continuous
random variables that have cumulative distribution function $F_X$, which
is parameterized by
$\mathbf{\theta}\in\mathbf{\Theta}\subset\mathbb{R}^d$. Let $X\sim F_X$,
independently of $\textbf{X}$. In the classical set-up, a $(1-\alpha,P)$
one-sided upper tolerance limit ($U_1(\textbf{X})$) and one-sided lower
tolerance limit ($L_1(\textbf{X})$) satisfy the expressions
$$\label{one_upper}
P_{\textbf{X}}\left ( P_{X}\left [X \leq U_{1}(\textbf{X})|\textbf{X}\right ]\geq P\right ) = 1-\alpha   (\#eq:one-upper)$$
and
$$\label{one_lower}
P_{\textbf{X}}\left ( P_{X}\left [L_{1}(\textbf{X})\leq X|\textbf{X}\right ]\geq P\right ) = 1-\alpha,   (\#eq:one-lower)$$
respectively. Similarly, a $(1-\alpha,P)$ two-sided tolerance interval,
$(L_2(\textbf{X}), \ U_2(\textbf{X}))$, satisfies
$$\label{twoTI}
P_{\textbf{X}}\left ( P_{X}\left [L_2(\textbf{X})\leq X \leq U_2(\textbf{X})|\textbf{X}\right ]\geq P\right ) = 1-\alpha.   (\#eq:twoTI)$$
Sometimes, controlling the proportion in the tails is required, in which
case we have a $(1-\alpha,P)$ equal-tailed tolerance interval,
$(L_e(\textbf{X}), \ U_e(\textbf{X}))$, that satisfies
$$\label{eqtailTI}
P_{\textbf{X}}\left ( \left\{P_{X}\left [L_e(\textbf{X})\leq X|\textbf{X}\right ]\leq (1-P)/2\right\} \cap \left\{P_{X}\left [U_e(\textbf{X})\geq X|\textbf{X}\right ]\leq (1-P)/2\right\}\right ) = 1-\alpha.   (\#eq:eqtailTI)$$
Equal-tailed tolerance intervals ensure that we simultaneously have no
more than $(1-P)/2$ of the sampled population below the lower tolerance
limit *and* no more than $(1-P)/2$ of the sampled population above the
upper tolerance limit.

Let $X_1,\ldots,X_n$ be $iid$ $\mathcal{N}\left(\mu,\sigma^2\right)$;
i.e.Â a normal distribution with unknown mean $\mu$ and unknown variance
$\sigma^2$. Let $\bar{X}$ and $S^2$ denote the sample mean and sample
variance, respectively. The formulas for $(1-\alpha,P)$ lower and upper
normal tolerance limits are
$$\label{cti}
L_{h}(\textbf{X})=\bar{X}-k_{h}(n,\alpha,P)S \ \ \ \textrm{and} \ \ \ U_{h}(\textbf{X})=\bar{X}+k_{h}(n,\alpha,P)S,   (\#eq:cti)$$
respectively, where $h\in\{1,2,e\}$. In other words, $h$ is an index
specifying whether we want one-sided tolerance limits, two-sided
tolerance intervals, or equal-tailed tolerance intervals.
$k_1(n,\alpha,P)$ and $k_2(n,\alpha,P)$ are the k-factors for these two
settings. The $k$-factor ensures that we capture at least a proportion
$P$ of the sampled population with confidence level $(1-\alpha)$.
$k_1(n,\alpha,P)$ is calculated by
$$\label{k1}
k_1(n,\alpha,P)=\frac{1}{\sqrt{n}}t_{n-1;1-\alpha}(\sqrt{n}z_{P}),   (\#eq:k1)$$
where $t_{f;q}(\delta)$ is the $q^{\textrm{th}}$ quantile of a
noncentral $t$-distribution with $f$ degrees of freedom and
noncentrality parameter $\delta$ and $z_{q}$ is the $q^{\textrm{th}}$
quantile of the standard normal distribution. $k_2(n,\alpha,P)$ is the
solution to the integral equation
$$\label{int}
\sqrt{\frac{{2n}}{\pi}} \int_0^{\infty}P\left(\chi^2_{n-1}
>\frac{(n-1)\chi^2_{1;P}(z^2)}{k_2(n,\alpha,P)^2}\right)e^{-\frac 1 2 nz^2}dz
= 1-\alpha,   (\#eq:int)$$
where $\chi^2_f$ is the chi-square random variable with $f$ degrees of
freedom and $\chi^{2}_{f;q}(\delta)$ is the $q^{\textrm{th}}$ quantile
of the noncentral chi-squared distribution with $f$ degrees of freedom
and noncentrality parameter $\delta$.

[@owen] was the first to propose equal-tailed tolerance intervals for
the normal distribution. Equal-tailed normal tolerance intervals still
take the form of (\@ref(eq:cti)), but where the tolerance factor
$k_e(n,\alpha,P)$ is found as the solution to the integral equation
$$\label{int_eq}
\left(2^{\frac{n-1}{2}}\Gamma\left(\frac{n-1}{2}\right)\right)^{-1} \int_{\frac{(n-1)\vartheta_n^2}{nk_e(n,\alpha,P)^2}}^{\infty}\left(2\Phi\left(-\vartheta_n+\frac{k_e(n,\alpha,P)\sqrt{n}z}{\sqrt{n-1}}\right)-1\right)e^{-z/2}z^{\frac{n-1}{2}-1}dz
= 1-\alpha,   (\#eq:int-eq)$$
where $\vartheta_n=\sqrt{n}z_{\frac{1+P}{2}}$ and $\Phi(\cdot)$ denotes
the standard normal cumulative distribution function. A general
discussion comparing the utility of two-sided tolerance intervals versus
equal-tailed tolerance intervals is found in @jensen.

The `normtol.int()` function in *tolerance* is able to calculate all of
the one-sided tolerance limits, two-sided tolerance intervals, and
equal-tailed tolerance intervals discussed above. In the past,
challenges with computing noncentral distributions necessitated the use
of approximations for $k_1(n,\alpha,P)$, $k_2(n,\alpha,P)$, and
$k_e(n,\alpha,P)$. For the two-sided tolerance intervals, early versions
of *tolerance* simply used various approximations that appeared in the
literature over the years for computing the $k$-factors. These are
controlled through the `method` argument and their specific formulas are
outlined in @tolerance, which utilized *tolerance* version 0.2.2. Since
then, the exact $k$-factor in (\@ref(eq:int)) and the exact equal-tailed
$k$-factor in (\@ref(eq:int-eq)) have been included. These are
implemented by setting `method = "EXACT"` and `method = "OCT"`,
respectively. Both of these methods use adaptive quadrature via the
`integrate()` function as well as box-constrained optimization via the
`optim()` function. The original approximation methods are still
available primarily to retain all functionality of previous versions of
*tolerance*.

The dataset that we will use to illustrate most of the procedures in our
discussion is a quality control dataset from @krishmat. The data are
from a machine that fills plastic containers with a liter of milk. At
the end of a particular shift, a sample of $n=20$ containers was
selected and the actual amount of milk in each container was measured
using a highly-accurate method. These measurements are as follows:

``` r
> milk <- c(0.968, 0.982, 1.030, 1.003, 1.046, 
+           1.020, 0.997, 1.010, 1.027, 1.010,
+           0.973, 1.000, 1.044, 0.995, 1.020, 
+           0.993, 0.984, 0.981, 0.997, 0.992)
```

A quick check of normality with the Shapiro-Wilk test confirms that this
is an appropriate assumption:

``` r
> shapiro.test(milk)

	Shapiro-Wilk normality test

data:  milk
W = 0.96364, p-value = 0.6188
```

For the milk data, the $(0.95,0.90)$ one-sided tolerance limits,
two-sided tolerance interval, and equal-tailed tolerance interval are
found as follows:

``` r
> normtol.int(x = milk, alpha = 0.05, P = 0.90, side = 1)
  alpha   P  x.bar 1-sided.lower 1-sided.upper
1  0.05 0.9 1.0036     0.9610333      1.046167

> normtol.int(x = milk, alpha = 0.05, P = 0.90, side = 2, method = "EXACT", m = 50)
  alpha   P  x.bar 2-sided.lower 2-sided.upper
1  0.05 0.9 1.0036     0.9523519      1.054848

> normtol.int(x = milk, alpha = 0.05, P = 0.90, side = 2, method = "OCT", m = 50)
  alpha   P  x.bar 2-sided.lower 2-sided.upper
1  0.05 0.9 1.0036     0.9471414      1.060059
```

Note that the equal-tailed tolerance interval is wider than the
corresponding two-sided tolerance interval due to the more stringent
requirement of controlling the proportions in the tails. For the
two-sided tolerance intervals, the additional argument `m` is used to
control the number of subintervals to use for performing the numerical
integration via `integrate()`. While not illustrated above, there is an
additional argument that can be used if one wishes to construct
log-normal tolerance intervals. The argument `log.norm` is a logical
argument set to `FALSE` by default. If set to `TRUE`, log-normal
tolerance intervals are calculated using the fact that if $X$ is
log-normally distributed, then $Y=\log(X)$ is normally distributed.
Thus, the `normtol.int()` function simply takes the logarithm of the
data in the `x` argument, constructs the desired normal tolerance
limits, and then takes the anti-log of those limits.

Users of normal tolerance intervals are often interested in summarizing
a variety of possible $k$-factors for given sample sizes $n$, confidence
levels $1-\alpha$, and content level $P$. The `K.table` function allows
the user to specify a vector of possible values for each of these three
quantities. A list is then returned whose elements are summarized
according to the `by` argument. For example, suppose we are interested
in the $k_1(n,\alpha,P)$ values for all combinations of $n\in\{10,20\}$,
$\alpha\in\{0.01,0.05\}$, and $P\in\{0.95,0.99\}$. Moreover, we would
like to summarize the list by the levels of $P$. This is accomplished as
follows:

``` r
> K.table(n = c(10, 20), alpha = c(0.01, 0.05), P = c(0.95, 0.99), 
+         side = 1, by.arg = "P")
$`0.95`
           10       20
0.99 3.738315 2.807866
0.95 2.910963 2.396002

$`0.99`
           10       20
0.99 5.073725 3.831558
0.95 3.981118 3.295157
```

For example, the first entry of the first matrix is the $k$-factor for a
one-sided $(0.99,0.95)$ tolerance limit when $n=10$. One can also set
`side = 2`, which requires the user to specify the `method` argument;
e.g.Â `"EXACT"` for values of $k_2(n,\alpha,P)$ or `"OCT"` for values of
$k_e(n,\alpha,P)$. The `by.arg` argument can also be set to `"alpha"` or
`"n"` depending on which quantity you want to represent the elements of
the outputted list.

Bayesian tolerance intervals were first presented in @ait. For the
Bayesian set-up, let **x** be a vector of realizations of $X$,
$\mathcal{L}(\mathbf{\theta}|\textbf{x})$ be the likelihood function,
$\pi(\mathbf{\theta})$ be a prior distribution for $\mathbf{\theta}$,
and $p(\mathbf{\theta}|\textbf{x})$ be the posterior distribution of
$\mathbf{\theta}$ given by
$$\label{posterior}
p(\mathbf{\theta}|\textbf{x})=\frac{\mathcal{L}(\mathbf{\theta}|\textbf{x})\pi(\mathbf{\theta})}{\int_{\mathbf{\Theta}}\mathcal{L}(\mathbf{\theta}|\textbf{x})\pi(\mathbf{\theta})d\mathbf{\theta}}.   (\#eq:posterior)$$
Then, $(1-\alpha,P)$ Bayesian one-sided upper and lower tolerance limits
satisfy
$$\label{Bupper}
P_{\mathbf{\Theta}}\left ( P_{X}\left [X \leq U_{1}(\mathbf{\theta})|\mathbf{\theta}\right ]\geq P | X\right) = 1-\alpha   (\#eq:Bupper)$$
and
$$\label{Blower}
P_{\mathbf{\Theta}}\left ( P_{X}\left [L_{1}(\mathbf{\theta})\leq X|\mathbf{\theta}\right ]\geq P | X \right) = 1-\alpha,   (\#eq:Blower)$$
respectively, a $(1-\alpha,P)$ Bayesian two-sided tolerance interval
satisfies
$$\label{BtwoTI}
P_{\mathbf{\Theta}}\left ( P_{X}\left [L_2(\mathbf{\theta})\leq X \leq U_2(\mathbf{\theta})|\mathbf{\theta}\right ]\geq P| X \right) = 1-\alpha,   (\#eq:BtwoTI)$$
and a $(1-\alpha,P)$ Bayesian equal-tailed tolerance interval satisfies
$$\label{BeqtailTI}
P_{\mathbf{\Theta}}\left ( \left\{P_{X}\left [L_e(\mathbf{\theta})\leq X|\mathbf{\theta}\right ]\leq (1-P)/2\right\} \cap \left\{P_{X}\left [U_e(\mathbf{\theta})\geq X|\mathbf{\theta}\right ]\leq (1-P)/2\right\}\right|X ) = 1-\alpha.   (\#eq:BeqtailTI)$$
Notice that the Bayesian set-up is calculated with respect to the
probability measure $P_{\mathbf{\Theta}}$ while the classical set-up is
calculated with respect to the distribution of the random sample
$\textbf{X}$. We refer the reader to the texts by @guttman and @krishmat
for more details on both classical and Bayesian tolerance intervals.

The parameters $\mu$ and $\sigma^2$ are still assumed unknown. We use
the conjugate priors $\pi(\mu|\sigma^2)$ and $\pi(\sigma^2)$, which are
$$\label{conj}
\mu|\sigma^2\sim\mathcal{N}\left(\mu_0,\sigma^2/n_0\right) \ \ \textrm{and} \ \ \sigma^2\sim\textrm{Scale-inv-}\chi^2\left(m_0,\sigma^2_0\right),   (\#eq:conj)$$
respectively, where $\textrm{Scale-inv-}\chi^2\left(\nu,\tau^2\right)$
is the scaled inverse chi-squared distribution with $\nu$ degrees of
freedom and scaling parameter $\tau^2$. Thus, the joint prior density of
$\left(\mu,\sigma^2\right)$ is
$\pi\left(\mu,\sigma^2\right)=\pi\left(\mu|\sigma^2\right)\pi\left(\sigma^2\right)$.
The four hyperparameters for this prior structure are
$\mu_0\in\mathbb{R},\sigma_0^2>0,m_0>0,n_0>0$. $m_0$ and $n_0$ are not
prior sample size quantities, but are tunable quantities to reflect the
prior precision *relative* to the sample size. The joint posterior
distribution is then
$$\label{jointpost}
p\left(\mu,\sigma^2|\textbf{x}\right)=p\left(\mu|\sigma^2\right)p\left(\sigma^2\right),   (\#eq:jointpost)$$
where $p\left(\mu|\sigma^2\right)$ and $p\left(\sigma^2\right)$ are the
distributions
$$\label{post}
\mu|\sigma^2\sim\mathcal{N}\left(\bar{\bar{x}},\frac{\sigma^2}{n_0+n}\right) \ \ \textrm{and} \ \ \sigma^2\sim\textrm{Scale-inv-}\chi^2\left(m_0+n-1,q^2\right),   (\#eq:post)$$
respectively, such that
$$\label{xq}
\bar{\bar{x}}=\frac{n_0\mu_0+n\bar{x}}{n_0+n} \ \ \textrm{and} \ \ q^2=\left(m_0+n-1\right)^{-1}\left[m_0\sigma_0^2+(n-1)s^2+\frac{n_0n}{n_0+n}(\bar{x}-\mu_0)^2\right].   (\#eq:xq)$$
Note that the formulas in the Bayesian set-up are written such that they
are conditioned on realizations of the observed data;
i.e.Â $\textbf{X}=\textbf{x}$. Furthermore, they are written in terms of
the sample estimates of the mean ($\bar{x}$) and variance ($s^2$).
Additional details on the above can be found, for example, in Chapter 3
of @gelman.

Similar to the classical setting, $(1-\alpha,P)$ Bayesian lower and
upper normal tolerance limits are, respectively,
$$\label{bayesTI}
L_{h}\left(\bar{x},s^2\right)=\bar{\bar{x}}-k_{h}\left(n,n_0,m_0,\alpha,P\right)q \ \ \ \textrm{and} \ \ \ U_{h}\left(\bar{x},s^2\right)=\bar{\bar{x}}+k_{h}\left(n,n_0,m_0,\alpha,P\right)q,   (\#eq:bayesTI)$$
where, again, $h$ is used as an index for one-sided limits, a two-sided
interval, or an equal-tailed interval. Note that these limits are
expressed in terms the maximum likelihood estimates of $\mu$ and
$\sigma^2$, which occur through how $\bar{\bar{x}}$ and $q$ are defined.
Thus, the one-sided $k$-factor is calculated by
$$\label{bayesk1}
k_1\left(n,n_0,m_0,\alpha,P\right)=\frac{1}{\sqrt{n_0+n}}t_{m_0+n-1;1-\alpha}\left(\sqrt{n_0+n}z_{P}\right),   (\#eq:bayesk1)$$
the two-sided $k$-factor $k_2\left(n,n_0,m_0,\alpha,P\right)$ is
calculated by finding the solution to
$$\label{int2}
\sqrt{\frac{{2(n_0+n)}}{\pi}} \int_0^{\infty}P\left(\chi^2_{m_0+n-1}
>\frac{\left(m_0+n-1\right)\chi^2_{1;P}\left(z^2\right)}{k_2\left(n,n_0,m_0,\alpha,P\right)^2}\right)e^{-\frac 1 2 (n_0+n)z^2}dz
= 1-\alpha,   (\#eq:int2)$$
and the equal-tailed $k$-factor $k_e\left(n,n_0,m_0,\alpha,P\right)$ is
calculated by finding the solution to
$$\label{intB}
\begin{aligned}
\frac{2^{-\left(\frac{m_0+n-1}{2}\right)}}{\Gamma\left(\frac{m_0+n-1}{2}\right)}\int_{\frac{(m_0+n-1)\vartheta_{n_0+n}^2}{(n_0+n)k_e(n,n_0,m_0,\alpha,P)^2}}^{\infty}&\left(2\Phi\left(-\vartheta_{n_0+n}+\frac{k_e(n,n_0,m_0,\alpha,P)\sqrt{n_0+n}z}{\sqrt{m_0+n-1}}\right)-1\right) \\
&\times e^{-z/2}z^{\frac{m_0+n-1}{2}-1}dz = 1-\alpha.
\end{aligned}   (\#eq:intB)$$

Finally, if one considers the non-informative prior distribution
$$\label{noninf}
\pi(\mu,\sigma^2)\propto\sigma^{-2},   (\#eq:noninf)$$
the solutions for the one-sided Bayesian normal tolerance limits and
two-sided Bayesian normal tolerance intervals are the same as for the
classical setting given in Equations
(\@ref(eq:cti))--(\@ref(eq:int-eq)); see Chapter 11 of @krishmat for the
details.

The `bayesnormtol.int()` function for computing Bayesian normal
tolerance intervals is new as of *tolerance* version 1.1.1. It was
composed to closely mirror the `normtol.int()` function. For the milk
data, suppose we use the conjugate prior structure in (\@ref(eq:conj)).
Assuming we have some historical knowledge about the milk filling
process, the following hyperparameter values are used: $\mu_0=1.000$,
$\sigma^2=0.001$, and $m_0=n_0=20$. Then, the Bayesian $(0.95,0.90)$
one-sided tolerance limits, two-sided tolerance interval, and
equal-tailed tolerance interval are found as follows:

``` r
> bayesnormtol.int(x = milk, alpha = 0.05, P = 0.90, side = 1,
+                  hyper.par = list(mu.0 = 1.000, sig2.0 = 0.001, 
+                                   m.0 = 20, n.0 = 20))

The `bayesnormtol.int()` function has the arguments `x`, `alpha`, `P`,
`side`, `method`, and `m` just as in the `normtol.int()`. However, here
we also have `hyper.par`, which is a list with elements for the four
hyperparameters. The output is structured identically to the output
obtained using `normtol.int()`, which allows for easy comparison between
the classical and Bayesian results.

# Fixed-effects ANOVA tolerance intervals {#anova}

The approach for classical normal tolerance intervals can be easily
extended for the balanced fixed-effects ANOVA model
$$\label{aov_model}
Y_{ij\ldots kl}=\theta+\alpha_i+\beta_j+\ldots+\gamma_k+\epsilon_{ij\ldots kl},   (\#eq:aov-model)$$
where $\theta$ is the grand mean, $\alpha_i,\beta_j,\ldots,\gamma_k$ are
the factor effects each subject to the constraint that the summation of
the effects over the respective index is equal to 0,
$\epsilon_{ij,\ldots kl}$ are $iid$ $\mathcal{N}\left(0,\sigma^2\right)$
error terms, and the indices are $i=1,\ldots,a$, $j=1,\ldots,b$,
$\ldots$, $k=1,\ldots,c$, and $l=1,\ldots,n$. The approach discussed
below is for the classical setting. Currently, the *tolerance* package
does not have a function for calculating Bayesian ANOVA tolerance
intervals.

Let $\textbf{Y}\in\mathbb{R}^{ab\cdots cn}$ be a vector of all of the
measured responses in (\@ref(eq:aov-model)), which are $iid$
$\mathcal{N}\left(0,\sigma^2\right)$. The formulas for the tolerance
limits in the fixed-effects ANOVA setting are:
$$\label{aovti}
\begin{aligned}
L_{i;h}(\textbf{Y})&=\bar{Y}_{i\cdot\ldots\cdot\cdot}-k_{h}\left(n_i,f,\alpha,P\right)\sqrt{{MSE}} \ \ \ \ \ \ & \textrm{and} & \ \ \ & U_{i;h}(\textbf{Y})&=\bar{Y}_{i\cdot\ldots\cdot\cdot}+k_{h}\left(n_i,f,\alpha,P\right)\sqrt{{MSE}} \\
L_{j;h}(\textbf{Y})&=\bar{Y}_{\cdot j\ldots\cdot\cdot}-k_{h}\left(n_j,f,\alpha,P\right)\sqrt{{MSE}} \ \ \ \ \ \ & \textrm{and} & \ \ \ & U_{j;h}(\textbf{Y})&=\bar{Y}_{\cdot j\ldots\cdot\cdot}+k_{h}\left(n_j,f,\alpha,P\right)\sqrt{{MSE}} \\
&\vdots & & & &\vdots \\
L_{k;h}(\textbf{Y})&=\bar{Y}_{\cdot\cdot\ldots k\cdot}-k_{h}\left(n_k,f,\alpha,P\right)\sqrt{{MSE}} \ \ \ \ \ \ & \textrm{and} & \ \ \ & U_{k;h}(\textbf{Y})&=\bar{Y}_{\cdot\cdot\ldots k\cdot}+k_{h}\left(n_k,f,\alpha,P\right)\sqrt{{MSE}} \\
\end{aligned}   (\#eq:aovti)$$
Conceptually, the formulas in (\@ref(eq:aovti)) are similar to those in
(\@ref(eq:cti)). We take a point estimate of the mean at each factor
level (i.e.Â the quantities
$\bar{Y}_{i\cdot\ldots\cdot\cdot}, \bar{Y}_{\cdot j\ldots\cdot\cdot},\ldots,\bar{Y}_{\cdot\cdot\ldots k\cdot}$)
and then add or subtract the $k$-factor times the standard deviation.
The standard deviation is now estimated by the root mean square error,
$\sqrt{{MSE}}$.

The $k$-factor in (\@ref(eq:aovti)), again, has the subscript $h$ to
indicate an index for one-sided limits, a two-sided interval, or an
equal-tailed interval. However, the formulas are modified for the ANOVA
setting. In formulas (\@ref(eq:k1))--(\@ref(eq:int-eq)), the quantity
$(n-1)$ reflects the degrees of freedom when estimating the sample
variance $S^2$. In the ANOVA setting, this is replaced by the degrees of
freedom due to the error; i.e.Â the degrees of freedom associated with
the $MSE$. Thus, we replace each occurrence of $(n-1)$ in
(\@ref(eq:k1))--(\@ref(eq:int-eq)) with $f$, the error degrees of
freedom. Moreover, all occurrences of the sample size $n$ are replaced
with the number of observations at each factor level;
i.e.Â $n_i,n_j,\ldots,n_k$. Note that the tolerance intervals presented
are only accurate for balanced (or nearly-balanced) ANOVA settings.

We analyze the well-known dataset that resulted from an experimental
design regarding the effects of wool type and the amount of tension
applied to a loom of yarn on the number of warp breaks that occur on
that loom of yarn [@tippett]. The first factor is wool type, which has
two levels: A or B. The second factor is tension level, which has three
levels: low (L), medium (M), or high (H). The six treatments
(i.e.Â factor level combinations) are randomly assigned to one of 54
looms of yarn. Thus, we have $n=9$ replicates per treatment. Suppose we
want to construct $(0.85,0.90)$ equal-tailed tolerance intervals for
each factor level's mean. Below is how we would do this in the
*tolerance* package:

``` r
> lm.out <- lm(breaks ~ wool + tension, data = warpbreaks)
> out <- anovatol.int(lm.out, data = warpbreaks, alpha = 0.10,
+                     P = 0.85, side = 2, method = "OCT")
These are 90%/85% 2-sided tolerance intervals.
> out
$wool
      mean  n        k 2-sided.lower 2-sided.upper
A 31.03704 27 1.886857      9.117165      52.95691
B 25.25926 27 1.886857      3.339387      47.17913

$tension
      mean  n        k 2-sided.lower 2-sided.upper
L 36.38889 18 1.948567    13.7521219      59.02566
M 26.38889 18 1.948567     3.7521219      49.02566
H 21.66667 18 1.948567    -0.9701003      44.30343
```

In the `anovatol.int()` function, we have similar arguments as in the
`normtol.int()` function, except now we input an object of class `"lm"`
and we also tell the function the name of the original dataset using the
`data` argument. The output is a list summarizing the tolerance interval
results for each factor level. For example, the $(0.90,0.85)$
equal-tailed tolerance interval for the medium tension applied to the
yarn is about $(3.75,49.03)$.

![Figure 2: Plot of the $(0.85,0.90)$ equal-tailed tolerance intervals
for the yarn strength data.](aov.png){#aov width="100%" alt="graphic without alt text"}

We can also produce a figure of the above output by using the
`plottol()` function as follows:

``` r
> plottol(out, x = warpbreaks)
```

The above produces the plot in Figure [2](#aov). This figure has a
separate panel for each factor. The $y$-axis is the response and the
$x$-axis is the levels of the respective factor. The solid black point
is the factor level mean and the red lines extend to the lower and upper
tolerance limits calculated earlier. Such a figure provides a relative
comparison of the tolerance intervals for each factor level.

# Sample size determination strategies {#ss}

As noted in @faulkweeks, an important question for statistical
practitioners is \"What sample size should be used to determine the
tolerance limits?\" Those same authors addressed this problem by
developing an approach to ensure that the calculated tolerance intervals
are \"close\" to the quantiles that result in a content level at least
as large as $P$. Their solution was developed for sample size
determination of one-sided tolerance limits and two-sided tolerance
intervals, but it is not applicable to equal-tailed tolerance intervals.
In order to briefly present their approach, let
$C_{\mu,\sigma}(\textbf{X})$ denote any of the three inner probabilities
in Equations (\@ref(eq:one-upper))--(\@ref(eq:twoTI)) or any of the
three analogous inner probabilities for the Bayesian set-up in Equations
(\@ref(eq:Bupper))--(\@ref(eq:BtwoTI)). To ensure the \"goodness\" of
the tolerance limits (interval), one must choose an arbitrary $P'>P$ and
small $\delta>0$ to determine a sample size $n^*$ such that
$$P_{\textbf{X}}\left\{C_{\mu,\sigma}(\textbf{X})\geq P'\right\}\geq\delta$$
or
$$P_{\mathbf{\theta}}\left\{C_{\mu,\sigma}(\textbf{X})\geq P'\right\}\geq\delta$$
for the classical or Bayesian setting, respectively.

The `norm.ss` function for sample size determination of normal tolerance
limits (intervals) is new as of *tolerance* version 1.1.1. The function
finds the minimum sample size $n^*$ for the approach due to @faulkweeks
discussed above. For our example, suppose the quality engineer
overseeing the milk-filling process wants to submit a future sample of
liters of milk to the highly-accurate measurement method. Per the
company's guidelines, the engineer needs to know the minimum sample size
to construct a $(0.95,0.90)$ two-sided tolerance interval such that
$P_{\textbf{X}}\left\{C_{\mu,\sigma}(\textbf{X})\geq 0.97\right\}\geq 0.10$.
This is calculated as follows:

``` r
> norm.ss(alpha = 0.05, P = 0.90, delta = 0.10, P.prime = 0.97, 
+         side = 2, m = 50, method = "FW")
  alpha   P delta P.prime  n
1  0.05 0.9   0.1    0.97 60
```

Thus, the engineer would need a minimum sample size of $n^*=60$ to
ensure that there is only a small probability $\delta=0.10$ that the
$(0.95,0.90)$ tolerance interval will have a content exceeding $P=0.90$
by $(P'-P)=0.07$.

In the `norm.ss()` function, the argument `method` is set to `"FW"`.
There are two additional sample size determination strategies that can
be calculated, which are controlled through the `method` argument. Both
of these strategies assume there is some historical data and
specification limits for the process at-hand. We briefly illustrate
these strategies below and refer the reader to @young:qe for further
details.

The first alternative strategy is a simple "back-of-the-envelope"
calculation. We consider the problem of designing a study to demonstrate
that a process or product falls within the specification limits
$(S_L,S_U)$. We are interested in the minimum sample size necessary such
that a $(1-\alpha,P)$ one-sided lower tolerance limit exceeds $S_L$, a
$(1-\alpha,P)$ one-sided upper tolerance limit falls below $S_U$, or a
$(1-\alpha,P)$ two-sided tolerance interval is contained within
$(S_L,S_U)$. In other words, this requires finding the minimum sample
size $n^*$ such that
$$\begin{aligned}
&S_L<\mu-k_{1}(n,\alpha,P)\sigma; \label{c1}
\end{aligned}   (\#eq:c1)$$

$$\begin{aligned}
&S_U>\mu+k_{1}(n,\alpha,P)\sigma; \ \textrm{or} \label{c2}
\end{aligned}   (\#eq:c2)$$

$$\begin{aligned}
&\mu\pm k_{e}(n,\alpha,P)\sigma\subset (S_L,S_U),  \label{c3}
\end{aligned}   (\#eq:c3)$$
for one-sided upper tolerance limits, one-sided lower tolerance limits,
or equal-tailed tolerance intervals, respectively. As emphasized in
@young:qe, this approach is intended simply for planning purposes and it
does not guarantee any specific bounds relative to the nominal coverage
probability. Note that (\@ref(eq:c3)) is for an equal-tailed tolerance
interval since we posit values for $\mu$ and $\sigma$ and, thus, the
resulting tolerance interval would be built around a (hypothetically)
true center of the normal population.

For our example, suppose that the quality engineer is overseeing the
launch of a new process for filling the one-liter containers of milk,
which is intended to be more accurate than the previous process. The
company set specification limits at $(0.990,1.010)$. For determining the
minimum sample size necessary to construct a $(0.95,0.90)$ two-sided
tolerance interval that is within the specification limits, the engineer
assumes the mean and variance from the data of the original process.
This calculation can then be done as follows:

``` r
> norm.ss(alpha = 0.05, P = 0.90, side = 2, spec = c(0.990, 1.010), 
+         method = "DIR", hyper.par = list(mu.0 = 1.004, sig2.0 = 0.001))
  alpha   P delta P.prime n
1  0.05 0.9               5
```

Thus, the minimum sample size is $n^*=5$. This calculation was done by
setting `method = "DIR"`, entering the specification limits in the
`spec` argument, and entering the assumed $\mu$ and $\sigma^2$ in the
argument `hyper.par`.

The second alternative strategy presented in @young:qe is a method for
providing data-dependent values of the precision quantities $P'$ and
$\delta$ in the approach due to @faulkweeks. The approach assumes there
is information on historical data, a set of current data, and
specification limits that can be used for calculating values of $P'$ and
$\delta$. The approach is intended to be used when there is no practical
guidance for setting these values other than using "rule-of-thumb"
quantities suggested in @faulkweeks.

For the milk filling process, suppose the engineer has historical
measurements, which have a combined mean 0.994 liters and variance
0.002. Suppose the specification limits on the original process are
$(0.900,1.100)$ and that the engineer needs a minimum sample size to
construct a $(0.95,0.90)$ two-sided tolerance interval to show that the
process meets the specification limits. However, the engineer is unsure
about levels to choose for $\delta$ and $P'$. We can use the `norm.ss()`
function as follows:

``` r
> norm.ss(x = milk, alpha = 0.05, P = 0.90, side = 2, spec = c(0.900, 1.100), 
+         method = "YGZO", hyper.par = list(mu.0 = 0.994, sig2.0 = 0.002))
  alpha   P     delta   P.prime  n
1  0.05 0.9 0.1807489 0.9733307 42
```

Thus, the engineer would need a minimum sample size of $n^*=42$ to
ensure that there is only a probability of about $\delta=0.181$ that the
$(0.95,0.90)$ tolerance interval will have a content exceeding $P=0.90$
by about $(P'-P)=0.073$.

# OC curves involving k-factors {#oc}

Sometimes, engineers and industrial statisticians are interested in
understanding how the confidence level or content level changes as a
function of $n$ for a given level of the $k$-factor. If one has normally
distributed data that they intend to demonstrate meets certain
specification limits, then it is important to understand the type of
values for $1-\alpha$ and $P$ that one can reasonably expect to use. In
this section, we present OC curves for such planning purposes.

The first type of OC curve is used when one specifies a range of values
of the sample size $n$ and a target value of the $k$-factor. Then, one
can either specify a set of $1-\alpha$ values and solve for $P$ or one
can specify a set of $P$ values and solve for $1-\alpha$. The values of
$n$ are plotted on the $x$-axis and the value being solved for -- either
$P$ or $1-\alpha$ -- is plotted on the $y$-axis. The different OC curves
pertain to the set of specified values -- either $1-\alpha$ or $P$.
Since too many curves can become cumbersome, we have placed an upper
limit of 10 curves that can be overlaid on a given plot. Also, the
colors used for the curves were chosen using a colorblind-friendly
palette that was established by @color.

Suppose a company is designing a product and the engineer needs to
collect enough data so that the resulting two-sided tolerance interval
will have a $k$-factor of 4. Content levels under consideration are
$P\in\{0.90, 0.95, 0.99\}$ while the possible number of samples that can
be used for the test are $n=10,11,\ldots,20$. In order to determine the
resulting confidence levels that can be obtained under these conditions,
the engineer can construct an OC curve for $1-\alpha$ using the
following code:

``` r
norm.OC(k = 4, alpha = NULL, P = c(0.90, 0.95, 0.99), n = 10:20,
        side = 2, method = "EXACT", m = 25)
```

The resulting plot is given in Figure [3](#alphaplot). For example, if
the engineer chooses $n=15$, then they can construct a two-sided
tolerance interval with $k=4$ and content level of $P=0.99$ with
confidence level near 0.96. However, if the engineer wishes to decrease
the content of the tolerance interval to $P=0.95$ or $P=0.90$, then a
confidence level very near 1 can be achieved.

![Figure 3: OC curves for $1-\alpha$ given the set of content levels
$P\in\{0.90, 0.95, 0.99\}$, sample sizes $n=10,11,\ldots,20$, and a
two-sided $k$-factor of 4.](alphaplot.png){#alphaplot width="100%" alt="graphic without alt text"}

In the `norm.OC()` function, the arguments of `side`, `method`, and `m`
are, again, passed down to the underlying `K.factor()` function. In
order to generate Figure [3](#alphaplot), we need to specify a single
value for `k` (i.e.Â the $k$-factor) and at least one value for `P`.
Since we are constructing curves where the sample size is on the
$x$-axis, we need at least two values for `n`. Note that `alpha` must be
left at its default `NULL` value.

![Figure 4: OC curves for $P$ given the set of confidence levels
$1-\alpha\in\{0.90, 0.95, 0.99\}$, sample sizes $n=10,11,\ldots,20$, and
a two-sided $k$-factor of 4.](Pplot.png){#Pplot width="100%" alt="graphic without alt text"}

Suppose now that the same engineer considers confidence levels of
$1-\alpha\in\{0.90, 0.95, 0.99\}$ with the same values of $k$ and $n$
from before. In order to determine the resulting content levels that can
be obtained under these conditions, the engineer can construct an OC
curve for $P$ using the following code:

``` r
norm.OC(k = 4, alpha = c(0.01, 0.05, 0.10), P = NULL, n = 10:20,
        side = 2, method = "EXACT", m = 25)
```

The resulting plot is given in Figure [4](#Pplot). For example, if the
engineer chooses $n=12$, then they can construct a two-sided tolerance
interval with $k=4$ and confidence level of $1-\alpha=0.99$ that
captures about 95% of the sampled population. However, if the engineer
wishes to decrease the confidence level of the tolerance interval to
$1-\alpha=0.95$ or $1-\alpha=0.90$, then a tolerance interval that
captures about 99% of the sampled population can be achieved. Note that
the code using the `norm.OC()` function is similar to the previous
example, except that now we specify at least one value for `alpha` and
leave `P` must at its default `NULL` value.

Finally, the `norm.OC()` function can also be used to construct an
OC-curve where the $k$-factor is calculated for specified values of $n$,
$1-\alpha$, and $P$. The different curves will be for each combination
of the specified $1-\alpha$ and $P$ levels. For our example, suppose the
engineer is interested in the $k$-factors for two-sided tolerance
intervals for the set of confidence levels
$1-\alpha\in\{0.90, 0.95, 0.99\}$, the set of content levels
$P\in\{0.90, 0.95, 0.99\}$, and sample sizes $n=10,11,\ldots,20$. Then,
we can specify the respective arguments in the `norm.OC()` function
while leaving the `k` argument at its default `NULL` value:

``` r
norm.OC(k = NULL, P = c(0.90, 0.95, 0.99), alpha=c(0.01, 0.05, 0.10), 
        n = 10:20, side = 2, method = "EXACT", m = 25)
```

The resulting plot is given in Figure [5](#alphaPplot). This OC-curve
allows the user to assess the width of the tolerance interval as $n$
changes for the given $(1-\alpha,P)$ tolerance levels.

![Figure 5: OC curves for the $k$-factor when given the set of
confidence levels $1-\alpha\in\{0.90, 0.95, 0.99\}$, the set of content
levels $P\in\{0.90, 0.95, 0.99\}$, and sample sizes
$n=10,11,\ldots,20$.](alphaPplot.png){#alphaPplot width="100%" alt="graphic without alt text"}

# Summary

*tolerance* is the only R package devoted to the calculation of
tolerance intervals and regions. Since its earlier versions
[@tolerance], there have been many updates to the package that include
additional parametric tolerance interval procedures, improved
nonparametric tolerance interval procedures, and some multivariate
tolerance region procedures.

In this paper, we focused on the varied capabilities of *tolerance*
pertaining to tolerance intervals for the normal distribution. Many of
these procedures have been added to the package since the discussion
presented in @tolerance. We discussed the calculation of one-sided
normal tolerance limits, exact and equal-tailed normal tolerance
intervals, Bayesian normal tolerance intervals, tolerance intervals for
fixed-effects ANOVA, and sample size determination strategies. We also
introduced novel operating characteristic (OC) curves that illustrate
how the $k$-factor, sample size, confidence level, and content level
each change relative to one another. As pointed out throughout our
discussion, all of these procedures have a large degree of utility in a
variety of practical contexts.

The *tolerance* package continues to expand the functions available for
constructing tolerance intervals and regions. We note that some of the
updates over the years have been a direct result of requests by end
users of the package. Thus, one can expect additional capabilities in
future versions of *tolerance*, both for the normal setting and other
data settings.
