title: Normal Tolerance Interval Procedures in the tolerance Package
abstract: Statistical tolerance intervals are used for a broad range of applications,
  such as quality control, engineering design tests, environmental monitoring, and
  bioequivalence testing. tolerance is the only R package devoted to procedures for
  tolerance intervals and regions. Perhaps the most commonly-employed functions of
  the package involve normal tolerance intervals. A number of new procedures for this
  setting have been included in recent versions of tolerance. In this paper, we discuss
  and illustrate the functions that implement these normal tolerance interval procedures,
  one of which is a new, novel type of operating characteristic curve.
