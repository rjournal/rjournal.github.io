title: 'shinybrms: Fitting Bayesian Regression Models Using a Graphical User Interface
  for the R Package brms'
abstract: ' Despite their advantages, the application of Bayesian regression models
  is still the exception compared to frequentist regression models. Here, we present
  our R package [shinybrms](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=shinybrms) which provides
  a graphical user interface for fitting Bayesian regression models, with the frontend
  consisting of a [shiny](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=shiny) app and the backend
  relying on the R package [brms](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=brms) which in
  turn relies on Stan. With shinybrms, we hope that Bayesian regression models (and
  regression models in general) will become more popular in applied research, data
  analyses, and teaching. Here, we illustrate our graphical user interface by the
  help of an example from medical research. '
