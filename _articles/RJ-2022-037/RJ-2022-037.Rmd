title: 'PDFEstimator: An R Package for Density Estimation and Analysis'
abstract: This article presents PDFEstimator, an R package for nonparametric probability
  density estimation and analysis, as both a practical enhancement and alternative
  to kernel-based estimators. PDFEstimator creates fast, highly accurate, data-driven
  probability density estimates for continuous random data through an intuitive interface.
  Excellent results are obtained for a diverse set of data distributions ranging from
  10 to $10^6$ samples when invoked with default parameter definitions in the absence
  of user directives. Additionally, the package contains methods for assessing the
  quality of any estimate, including robust plotting functions for detailed visualization
  and trouble-shooting. Usage of PDFEstimator is illustrated through a variety of
  examples, including comparisons to several kernel density methods.
