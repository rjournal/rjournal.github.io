title: 'SchemaOnRead: A Package for Schema-on-Read in R'
abstract: SchemaOnRead is a CRAN package that provides an extensible mechanism for
  importing a wide range of file types into R as well as support for the emerging
  schema-on-read paradigm in R. The schema-on-read tools within the package include
  a single function call that recursively reads folders with text, comma separated
  value, raster image, R data, HDF5, NetCDF, spreadsheet, Weka, Epi Info, Pajek network,
  R network, HTML, SPSS, Systat, and Stata files. It also recursively reads folders
  (e.g., schemaOnRead("folder")), returning a nested list of the contained elements.
  The provided tools can be used as-is or easily customized to implement tool chains
  in R. This paperâ€™s contribution is that it introduces and describes the SchemaOnRead
  package and compares it to related R packages.
