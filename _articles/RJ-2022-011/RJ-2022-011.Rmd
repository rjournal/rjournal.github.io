title: 'PSweight: An R Package for Propensity Score Weighting Analysis'
abstract: ' Propensity score weighting is an important tool for comparative effectiveness
  research. Besides the inverse probability of treatment weights (IPW), recent development
  has introduced a general class of balancing weights, corresponding to alternative
  target populations and estimands. In particular, the overlap weights (OW) lead to
  optimal covariate balance and estimation efficiency, and a target population of
  scientific and policy interest. We develop the R package [PSweight](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=PSweight)
  to provide a comprehensive design and analysis platform for causal inference based
  on propensity score weighting. PSweight supports (i) a variety of balancing weights,
  (ii) binary and multiple treatments, (iii) simple and augmented weighting estimators,
  (iv) nuisance-adjusted sandwich variances, and (v) ratio estimands. PSweight also
  provides diagnostic tables and graphs for covariate balance assessment. We demonstrate
  the functionality of the package using a data example from the National Child Development
  Survey (NCDS), where we evaluate the causal effect of educational attainment on
  income. '
