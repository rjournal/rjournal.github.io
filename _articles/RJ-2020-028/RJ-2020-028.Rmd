title: S, R, and Data Science
abstract: ' Data science is increasingly important and challenging. It requires computational
  tools and programming environments that handle big data and difficult computations,
  while supporting creative, high-quality analysis. The R language and related software
  play a major role in computing for data science. R is featured in most programs
  for training in the field. R packages provide tools for a wide range of purposes
  and users. The description of a new technique, particularly from research in statistics,
  is frequently accompanied by an R package, greatly increasing the usefulness of
  the description. The history of R makes clear its connection to data science. R
  was consciously designed to replicate in open-source software the contents of the
  S software. S in turn was written by data analysis researchers at Bell Labs as part
  of the computing environment for research in data analysis and collaborations to
  apply that research, rather than as a separate project to create a programming language.
  The features of S and the design decisions made for it need to be understood in
  this broader context of supporting effective data analysis (which would now be called
  data science). These characteristics were all transferred to R and remain central
  to its effectiveness. Thus, R can be viewed as based historically on a domain-specific
  language for the domain of data science. Note to R Journal readers: The following
  paper was published online in the History of Programming Languages (HOPL), Volume
  4, in June 2020 (DOI 10.1145/3386334). The content seems likely to be of interest
  to many R Journal readers, and since HOPL is plausibly not typical reading for data
  scientists, the editors of the R Journal have kindly offered to republish the paper
  here. This is possible thanks also to the enlightened policy of the ACM, providing
  for open distribution through the chosen copyright declaration.'
