title: 'mixedsde: A Package to Fit Mixed Stochastic Differential Equations'
abstract: 'Stochastic differential equations (SDEs) are useful to model continuous
  stochastic processes. When (independent) repeated temporal data are available, variability
  between the trajectories can be modeled by introducing random effects in the drift
  of the SDEs. These models are useful to analyze neuronal data, crack length data,
  pharmacokinetics, financial data, to cite some applications among other. The R package
  focuses on the estimation of SDEs with linear random effects in the drift. The goal
  is to estimate the common density of the random effects from repeated discrete observations
  of the SDE. The package mixedsde proposes three estimation methods: a Bayesian parametric,
  a frequentist parametric and a frequentist nonparametric method. The three procedures
  are described as well as the main functions of the package. Illustrations are presented
  on simulated and real data.'
