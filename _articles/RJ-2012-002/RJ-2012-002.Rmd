title: 'MARSS: Multivariate Autoregressive State-space Models for Analyzing Time-series
  Data'
abstract: MARSS is a package for fitting multivariate autoregressive state-space models
  to time-series data. The MARSS package implements state-space models in a maximum
  likelihood framework. The core functionality of MARSS is based on likelihood maximization
  using the Kalman filter/smoother, combined with an EM algorithm. To make comparisons
  with other packages available, parameter estimation is also permitted via direct
  search routines available in 'optim'. The MARSS package allows data to contain missing
  values and allows a wide variety of model structures and constraints to be specified
  (such as fixed or shared parameters). In addition to model-fitting, the package
  provides bootstrap routines for simulating data and generating confidence intervals,
  and multiple options for calculating model selection criteria (such as AIC).

The [*MARSS*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=MARSS) package [@MARSS]
is an R package for fitting linear multivariate autoregressive
state-space (MARSS) models with Gaussian errors to time-series data.
This class of model is extremely important in the study of linear
stochastic dynamical systems, and these models are used in many
different fields, including economics, engineering, genetics, physics
and ecology. The model class has different names in different fields;
some common names are dynamic linear models (DLMs) and vector
autoregressive (VAR) state-space models. There are a number of existing
R packages for fitting this class of models, including
[*sspir*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=sspir) [@sspir] for
univariate data and [*dlm*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=dlm)
[@dlm], [*dse*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=dse) [@dse],
[*KFAS*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=KFAS) [@KFAS] and
[*FKF*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=FKF) [@FKF] for multivariate
data. Additional packages are available on other platforms, such as
SsfPack [@DurbinKoopman2001], EViews
([www.eviews.com](http://www.eviews.com){.uri}) and Brodgar
([www.brodgar.com](http://www.brodgar.com){.uri}). Except for Brodgar
and [*sspir*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=sspir), these packages
provide maximization of the likelihood surface (for maximum-likelihood
parameter estimation) via quasi-Newton or Nelder-Mead type algorithms.
The [*MARSS*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=MARSS) package was
developed to provide an alternative maximization algorithm, based
instead on an Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm and to provide a
standardized model-specification framework for fitting different model
structures.

The [*MARSS*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=MARSS) package was
originally developed for researchers analyzing data in the natural and
environmental sciences, because many of the problems often encountered
in these fields are not commonly encountered in disciplines like
engineering or finance. Two typical problems are high fractions of
irregularly spaced missing observations and observation error variance
that cannot be estimated or known a priori [@Schnute1994]. Packages
developed for other fields did not always allow estimation of the
parameters of interest to ecologists because these parameters are always
fixed in the package authors' field or application. The
[*MARSS*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=MARSS) package was
developed to address these issues and its three main differences are
summarized as follows.

First, maximum-likelihood optimization in most packages for fitting
state-space models relies on quasi-Newton or Nelder-Mead direct search
routines, such as provided in `optim` (for
[*dlm*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=dlm)) or `nlm` (for
[*dse*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=dse)). Multidimensional
state-space problems often have complex, non-linear likelihood surfaces.
For certain types of multivariate state-space models, an alternative
maximization algorithm exists; though generally slower for most models,
the EM-algorithm [@MetaxoglouSmith2007; @ShumwayStoffer1982], is
considerably more robust than direct search routines (this is
particularly evident with large amounts of missing observations). To
date, no R package for the analysis of multivariate state-space models
has implemented the EM algorithm for maximum-likelihood parameter
estimation ([*sspir*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=sspir)
implements it for univariate models). In addition, the
[*MARSS*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=MARSS) package implements
an EM algorithm for constrained parameter estimation [@Holmes2010] to
allow fixed and shared values within parameter matrices. To our
knowledge, this constrained EM algorithm is not implemented in any
package, although the Brodgar package implements a limited version for
dynamic factor analysis.

Second, model specification in the
[*MARSS*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=MARSS) package has a
one-to-one relationship to a MARSS model as written in matrix form on
paper. Any model that can be written in MARSS form can be fitted without
extra code by the user. In contrast, other packages require users to
write unique functions in matrix form (a non-trivial task for many
non-expert R users). For example, while
[*dlm*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=dlm) includes linear and
polynomial univariate models, multivariate regression is not readily
accessible without these custom functions; in
[*MARSS*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=MARSS), all models written
in matrix form are fitted using the same model specification. The
[*MARSS*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=MARSS) package also allows
degenerate multivariate models to be fitted, which means that some or
all observation or process variances can be set to 0. This allows users
to include deterministic features in their models and to rewrite models
with longer lags or moving averaged errors as a MARSS model.

Third, the [*MARSS*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=MARSS) package
provides algorithms for computing model selection criteria that are
specific for state-space models. Model selection criteria are used to
quantify the data support for different model and parameter structures
by balancing the ability of the model to fit the data against the
flexibility of the model. The criteria computed in the
[*MARSS*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=MARSS) package are based on
Akaike's Information Criterion (AIC). Models with the lowest AIC are
interpreted as receiving more data support. While AIC and its small
sample corrected version AICc are easily calculated for fixed effects
models (these are standard output for `lm` and `glm`, for instance),
these criteria are biased for hierarchical or state-space autoregressive
models. The [*MARSS*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=MARSS) package
provides an unbiased AIC criterion via innovations bootstrapping
[@CavanaughShumway1997; @StofferWall1991] and parametric bootstrapping
[@Holmes2010]. The package also provides functions for approximate and
bootstrap confidence intervals, and bias correction for estimated
parameters.

The package comes with an extensive user guide that introduces users to
the package and walks the user through a number of case studies
involving ecological data. The selection of case studies includes
estimating trends with univariate and multivariate data, making
inferences concerning spatial structure with multi-location data,
estimating inter-species interaction strengths using multi-species data,
using dynamic factor analysis to reduce the dimension of a multivariate
dataset, and detecting structural breaks in data sets. Though these
examples have an ecological focus, the analysis of multivariate time
series models is cross-disciplinary work and researchers in other fields
will likely benefit from these examples.

# The MARSS model

The MARSS model includes a process model and an observation model. The
process component of a MARSS model is a multivariate first-order
autoregressive (MAR-1) process. The multivariate process model takes the
form

$$\mathbf{ x}_t = \mathbf{ B}\mathbf{ x}_{t-1} +\mathbf{ u}+ \mathbf{ w}_{t};~~~\mathbf{ w}_{t} \sim \,\textup{\textrm{MVN}}(0,\mathbf{ Q})
\label{eq:marss.x}  (\#eq:marss-x)  $$

The $\mathbf{ x}$ is an $m \times 1$ vector of state values, equally
spaced in time, and $\mathbf{ B}$, $\mathbf{ u}$ and $\mathbf{ Q}$ are
the state process parameters. The $m \times m$ matrix $\mathbf{ B}$
allows interaction between state processes; the diagonal elements of
$\mathbf{ B}$ can also be interpreted as coefficients of auto-regression
in the state vectors through time. The vector $\mathbf{ u}$ describes
the mean trend or mean level (depending on the $\mathbf{ B}$ structure),
and the correlation of the process deviations is determined by the
structure of the matrix $\mathbf{ Q}$. In version 2.x of the
[*MARSS*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=MARSS) package, the
$\mathbf{ B}$ and $\mathbf{ Q}$ parameters are time-invariant; however,
in version 3.x, all parameters can be time-varying and also the
$\mathbf{ u}$ can be moved into the $\mathbf{ x}$ term to specify models
with an auto-regressive trend process (called a stochastic level model).

Written out for two state processes, the MARSS process model would be:
$$\begin{gathered}
\begin{bmatrix}x_1\\ x_2\end{bmatrix}_t
= \begin{bmatrix}b_{11}&b_{12}\\ b_{21}&b_{22}\end{bmatrix}
\begin{bmatrix}x_1\\ x_2\end{bmatrix}_{t-1} + \begin{bmatrix}u_1\\ u_2\end{bmatrix}
+ \begin{bmatrix}w_1\\ w_2\end{bmatrix}_t,\\
\begin{bmatrix}w_1\\ w_2\end{bmatrix}_t \sim \,\textup{\textrm{MVN}}\begin{pmatrix}0,\begin{bmatrix}q_{11}&q_{12}\\ q_{21}&q_{22}\end{bmatrix} \end{pmatrix}  
\end{gathered}$$ Some of the parameter elements will generally be fixed
to ensure identifiability. Within the MAR-1 form, MAR-p or
autoregressive models with lag-p and models with exogenous factors
(covariates) can be included by properly defining the $\mathbf{ B}$,
$\mathbf{ x}$ and $\mathbf{ Q}$ elements. See for example @Tsay2010
where the formulation of various time-series models as MAR-1 models is
covered.

The initial state vector is specified at $t=0$ or $t=1$ as
$$\label{eq:marss.xx}
\mathbf{ x}_0 \sim \,\textup{\textrm{MVN}}(\boldsymbol\pi,\mathbf{\Lambda})\quad\text{or}\quad\mathbf{ x}_1 \sim \,\textup{\textrm{MVN}}(\boldsymbol\pi,\mathbf{\Lambda})  (\#eq:marss-xx)  $$
where ${\boldsymbol\pi}$ is the mean of the initial state distribution
or a constant. $\mathbf{\Lambda}$ specifies the variance of the initial
states or is specified as 0 if the initial state is treated as fixed
(but possibly unknown).

The multivariate observation component in a MARSS model is expressed as
$$\label{eq:marss.y}
\mathbf{ y}_t = \mathbf{ Z}\mathbf{ x}_t + \mathbf{ a}+ \mathbf{ v}_{t};~~~\mathbf{ v}_{t} \sim \,\textup{\textrm{MVN}}(0,\mathbf{ R})  (\#eq:marss-y)  $$
where $\mathbf{ y}_t$ is an $n \times 1$ vector of observations at time
$t$, $\mathbf{ Z}$ is an $n \times m$ matrix, $\mathbf{ a}$ is an
$n \times 1$ matrix, and the correlation structure of observation errors
is specified with the matrix $\mathbf{ R}$. Including $\mathbf{ Z}$ and
$\mathbf{ a}$ is not required for every model, but these parameters are
used when some state processes are observed multiple times (perhaps with
different scalings) or when observations are linear combinations of the
state processes (such as in dynamic factor analysis). Note that time
steps in the model are equidistant, but there is no requirement that
there be an observation at every time step; $\mathbf{ y}$ may have
missing values scattered thoughout it.

Written out for three observation processes and two state processes, the
MARSS observation model would be $$\begin{gathered}
\begin{bmatrix}y_1\\ y_2\\ y_3\end{bmatrix}_t
= \begin{bmatrix}z_{11}&z_{12}\\ z_{21}&z_{22}\\ z_{31}&z_{32}\end{bmatrix}
\begin{bmatrix}x_1\\ x_2\end{bmatrix}_t + \begin{bmatrix}a_1\\ a_2\\ a_3\end{bmatrix}
+ \begin{bmatrix}v_1\\ v_2\\ v_3\end{bmatrix}_t\\
\begin{bmatrix}v_1\\ v_2\\ v_3\end{bmatrix}_t \sim \,\textup{\textrm{MVN}}\begin{pmatrix}0,
 \begin{bmatrix}r_{11}&r_{12}&r_{13}\\ r_{21}&r_{22}&r_{23}\\ r_{31}&r_{32}&r_{33}\end{bmatrix} \end{pmatrix}  \\
\end{gathered}$$ Again, some of the parameter elements will generally be
fixed to ensure identifiability.

The MARSS process and observation models are flexible and many
multivariate time-series models can be rewritten in MARSS form. See
textbooks on time series analysis where reformulating AR-p, ARMA-p as a
MARSS model is covered [such as @Tsay2010; @Harvey1989].

# Package overview

The package is designed to fit MARSS models with fixed and shared
elements within the parameter matrices. The following shows such a model
using a mean-reverting random walk model with three observation time
series as an example:

$$\label{eq:marss.example}
  equations  (\#eq:marss-example)  $$ $$\label{eq:marss.example.x}
\begin{bmatrix}x_1\\ x_2\end{bmatrix}_t
= \begin{bmatrix}b&0\\ 0&b\end{bmatrix}
\begin{bmatrix}x_1\\ x_2\end{bmatrix}_{t-1} + \begin{bmatrix}0\\ 0\end{bmatrix}
+ \begin{bmatrix}w_1\\ w_2\end{bmatrix}_t  (\#eq:marss-example-x)  $$
$$\label{eq:marss.example.w}
\begin{bmatrix}w_1\\ w_2\end{bmatrix}_t \sim \,\textup{\textrm{MVN}}\begin{pmatrix}0,\begin{bmatrix}q_{11}&q_{12}\\ q_{12}&q_{22}\end{bmatrix} \end{pmatrix}  (\#eq:marss-example-w)  $$
$$\label{eq:marss.example.x0}
\begin{bmatrix}x_1\\ x_2\end{bmatrix}_0 \sim \,\textup{\textrm{MVN}}\begin{pmatrix}\begin{bmatrix}0\\ 0\end{bmatrix},\begin{bmatrix}1&0\\ 0&1\end{bmatrix} \end{pmatrix}  (\#eq:marss-example-x0)  $$
$$\label{eq:marss.example.y}
\begin{bmatrix}y_1\\y_2\\y_3\end{bmatrix}_t
= \begin{bmatrix}1&0\\ 0&1\\ 1&0\end{bmatrix}
\begin{bmatrix}x_1\\x_2\end{bmatrix}_t +
\begin{bmatrix}a_1\\ 0\\ 0\end{bmatrix}
+ \begin{bmatrix}v_1\\ v_2\\ v_3\end{bmatrix}_t  (\#eq:marss-example-y)  $$
$$\label{eq:marss.example.v}
\begin{bmatrix}v_1\\ v_2\\ v_3\end{bmatrix}_t \sim \,\textup{\textrm{MVN}}\begin{pmatrix}0,
 \begin{bmatrix}r_1&0&0\\ 0&r_2&0\\ 0&0&r_2\end{bmatrix} \end{pmatrix}  (\#eq:marss-example-v)  $$

Notice that many parameter elements are fixed, while others are shared
(have the same symbol).

## Model specification

Model specification has a one-to-one relationship to the model written
on paper in matrix form (Equation \@ref(eq:marss-example)). The user
passes in a list which includes an element for each parameter in the
model: `B`, `U`, `Q`, `Z`, `A`, `R`, `x0`, `V0`. The list element
specifies the form of the corresponding parameter in the model.

The most general way to specify a parameter form is to use a list
matrix. The list matrix allows one to combine fixed and estimated
elements in one's parameter specification. For example, to specify the
parameters in Equation \@ref(eq:marss-example), one would write the
following list matrices:

``` r
> B1 = matrix(list("b", 0, 0, "b"), 2, 2)
> U1 = matrix(0, 2, 1)
> Q1 = matrix(c("q11", "q12", "q12", "q22"), 2, 2)
> Z1 = matrix(c(1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0), 3, 2)
> A1 = matrix(list("a1", 0, 0), 3, 1)
> R1 = matrix(list("r1", 0, 0, 0, "r2", 0, 
+     0, 0, "r2"), 3, 3)
> pi1 = matrix(0, 2, 1)
> V1 = diag(1, 2)
> model.list = list(B = B1, U = U1, Q = Q1, Z = Z1,
+     A = A1, R = R1, x0 = pi1, V0 = V1)
```

When printed at the R command line, each parameter matrix looks exactly
like the parameters as written out in Equation \@ref(eq:marss-example).
Numeric values are fixed and character values are names of elements to
be estimated. Elements with the same character name are constrained to
be equal (no sharing across parameter matrices, only within).

List matrices allow the most flexible model structures, but
[*MARSS*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=MARSS) also has text
shortcuts for many common model structures. The structure of the
variance-covariance matrices in the model are specified via the `Q`,
`R`, and `V0` components, respectively. Common structures are errors
independent with one variance on the diagonal (specified with
`"diagonal and equal"`) or all variances different
(`"diagonal and unequal"`); errors correlated with the same correlation
parameter (`"equalvarcov"`) or correlated with each process having
unique correlation parameters (`"unconstrained"`), or all zero
(`"zero"`). Common structures for the matrix $\mathbf{ B}$ are an
identity matrix (`"identity"`); a diagonal matrix with one value on the
diagonal (`"diagonal and equal"`) or all different values on the
diagonal (`"diagonal and unequal"`), or all values different
(`"unconstrained"`). Common structures for the $\mathbf{ u}$ and
$\mathbf{ a}$ parameters are all equal (`"equal"`); all unequal
(`"unequal"` or `"unconstrained"`), or all zero (`"zero"`).

The $\mathbf{ Z}$ matrix is idiosyncratic and there are fewer shortcuts
for its specification. One common form for $\mathbf{ Z}$ is a design
matrix, composed of 0s and 1s, in which each row sum equals 1. This is
used when each $y$ in $\mathbf{ y}$ is associated with one $x$ in
$\mathbf{ x}$ (one $x$ may be associated with multiple $y$'s). In this
case, $\mathbf{ Z}$ can be specified using a factor of length $n$. The
factor specifies to which $x$ each of the $n$ $y$'s correspond. For
example, the $\mathbf{ Z}$ in Equation \@ref(eq:marss-example) could be
specified `factor(c(1, 2, 1))` or `factor(c("a", "b", "a"))`.

## Model fitting with the MARSS function

The main package function is `MARSS`. This function fits a MARSS model
(Equations \@ref(eq:marss-x) and \@ref(eq:marss-y)) to a matrix of data
and returns the maximum-likelihood estimates for the $\mathbf{ B}$,
$\mathbf{ u}$, $\mathbf{ Q}$, $\mathbf{ Z}$, $\mathbf{ a}$,
$\mathbf{ R}$, $\boldsymbol\pi$, and $\mathbf{\Lambda}$ parameters or
more specifically, the free elements in those parameters since many
elements will be fixed for a given model form. The basic `MARSS` call
takes the form:

``` r
> MARSS(data, model = model.list) 
```

where `model.list` has the form shown in the R code above. The data must
be passed in as an $n \times T$ matrix, that is time goes across
columns. A vector is not a matrix, nor is a data frame. A matrix of 3
inputs ($n=3$) measured for 6 time steps might look like
$$\mathbf{ y}= \left[ \begin{array}{ccccccc}
    1 & 2 & \text{NA} & \text{NA} & 3.2 & 8\\
    2 & 5 &  3 & \text{NA} & 5.1 & 5\\
    1 & \text{NA} & 2 & 2.2 & \text{NA} & 7\end{array} \right]$$ where
NA denotes a missing value. Note that the time steps are equidistant,
but there may not be data at each time step, thus the observations are
not constrained to be equidistant.

The only required argument to `MARSS` is a matrix of data. The `model`
argument is an optional argument, although typically included, which
specifies the form of the MARSS model to be fitted (if left off, a
default form is used). Other `MARSS` arguments include initial parameter
values (`inits`), a non-default value for missing values (`miss.value`),
whether or not the model should be fitted (`fit`), whether or not output
should be verbose (`silent`), and the method for maximum-likelihood
estimation (`method`). The default method is the EM algorithm
(`method = "kem"`), but the quasi-Newton method BFGS is also allowed
(`method = "BFGS"`). Changes to the default fitting algorithm are
specified with `control`; for example, `control$minit` is used to change
the minimum number of iterations used in the maximization algorithm. Use
`?MARSS` to see all the `control` options.

Each call to the `MARSS` function returns an object of class
`"marssMLE"`, an estimation object. The `marssMLE` object is a list with
the following elements: the estimated parameter values (`par`), Kalman
filter and smoother output (`kf`), convergence diagnostics
(`convergence`, `numIter`, `errors`, `logLik`), basic model selection
metrics (`AIC`, `AICc`), and a model object `model` which contains both
the MARSS model specification and the data. Further list elements, such
as bootstrap AIC or confidence intervals, are added with functions that
take a `marssMLE` object as input.

## Model selection and confidence intervals

One of the most commonly used model selection tools in the
maximum-likelihood framework is Akaike's Information Criterion (AIC) or
the small sample variant (AICc). Both versions are returned with the
call to `MARSS`. A state-space specific model selection metric, AICb
[@CavanaughShumway1997; @StofferWall1991], can be added to a `marssMLE`
object using the function `MARSSaic`.

The function `MARSSparamCIs` is used to add confidence intervals and
bias estimates to a `marssMLE` object. Confidence intervals may be
computed by resampling the Kalman innovations if all data are present
(innovations bootstrapping) or implementing a parametric bootstrap if
some data are missing (parametric bootstraping). All bootstrapping in
the [*MARSS*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=MARSS) package is done
with the lower-level function `MARSSboot`. Because bootstrapping can be
time-consuming, `MARSSparamCIs` also allows approximate confidence
intervals to be calculated with a numerically estimated Hessian matrix.
If bootstrapping is used to generate confidence intervals,
`MARSSparamCIs` will also return a bootstrap estimate of parameter bias.

## Estimated state trajectories

In addition to outputting the maximum-likelihood estimates of the model
parameters, the `MARSS` call will also output the maximum-likelihood
estimates of the state trajectories (the $\mathbf{ x}$ in the MARSS
model) conditioned on the entire dataset. These states represent output
from the Kalman smoother using the maximum-likelihood parameter values.
The estimated states are in the `states` element in the `marssMLE`
object output from a `MARSS` call. The standard errors of the state
estimates are in element `states.se` of the `marssMLE` object. For
example, if a MARSS model with one state ($m=1$) was fitted to data and
the output placed in `fit`, the state estimates and $\pm$ 2 standard
errors could be plotted with the following code:

``` r
> plot(fit$states, type = "l", lwd = 2)
> lines(fit$states - 2*fit$states.se)
> lines(fit$states + 2*fit$states.se)
```

# Example applications

To demonstrate the [*MARSS*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=MARSS)
package functionality, we show a series of short examples based on a few
of the case studies in the MARSS User Guide. The user guide includes
much more extensive analysis and includes many other case studies. All
the case studies are based on analysis of ecological data, as this was
the original motivation for the package.

## Trend estimation

A commonly used model in ecology describing the dynamics of a population
experiencing density-dependent growth is the Gompertz model
[@ReddingiusdenBoer1989; @DennisTaper1994]. The population dynamics are
stochastic and driven by the combined effects of environmental variation
and random demographic variation.

The log-population sizes from this model can be described by an AR-1
process:
$$x_{t} = bx_{t-1} + u + w_{t}; ~~~w_{t} \sim Normal(0, ~\sigma^2)$$ In
the absence of density dependence ($b = 1$), the exponential growth rate
or rate of decline of the population is controlled by the parameter $u$;
when the population experiences density-dependence ($|b|<1$), the
population will converge to an equilibrium $u/(1-b)$. The initial states
are given by $$x_{0} \sim Normal(\pi, \lambda)$$ The observation process
is described by
$$y_{t} = x_{t} + v_{t}; ~~~v_{t} \sim Normal(0, ~\eta^{2})$$ where $y$
is a vector of observed log-population sizes. The bias parameter, $a$,
has been set equal to 0.

This model with $b$ set to 1 is a standard model used for species of
concern [@Dennisetal1991] when the population is well below carrying
capacity and the goal is to estimate the underlying trend ($u$) for use
in population viability analysis
[@Holmes2001; @Holmesetal2007; @Humbertetal2009]. To illustrate a simple
trend analysis, we use the `graywhales` dataset included in the
[*MARSS*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=MARSS) package. This data
set consists of 24 abundance estimates of eastern North Pacific gray
whales [@Gerberetal1999]. This population was depleted by commercial
whaling prior to 1900 and has steadily increased since the first
abundance estimates were made in the 1950s [@Gerberetal1999]. The
dataset consists of 24 annual observations over 39 years, 1952--1997;
years without an estimate are denoted as `NA`. The time step between
observations is one year and the goal is to estimate the annual rate of
increase (or decrease).

After log-transforming the data, maximum-likelihood parameter estimates
can be calculated using `MARSS`:

``` r
> data(graywhales)
> years = graywhales[,1]
> loggraywhales = log(graywhales[,2])
> kem = MARSS(loggraywhales)
```

The `MARSS` wrapper returns an object of class `"marssMLE"`, which
contains the parameter estimates (`kem$par`), state estimates
(`kem$states`) and their standard errors (`kem$states.se`). The state
estimates can be plotted with $\pm$ 2 standard errors, along with the
original data (Figure [1](#figure:graywhales)).

whales (solid line) population size, with data (points) and 2 standard
errors (dashed lines). Additional examples of trend estimation may be

## Identification of spatial population structure using model selection

In population surveys, censuses are often taken at multiple sites and
those sites may or may not be connected through dispersal. Adjacent
sites with high exchange rates of individuals will synchronize
subpopulations (making them behave as a single subpopulation), while
sites with low mixing rates will behave more independently as discrete
subpopulations. We can use MARSS models and model selection to test
hypotheses concerning the spatial structure of a population
[@Hinrichsen2009; @HinrichsenHolmes2009; @Wardetal2010].

For the multi-site application, $\mathbf{ x}$ is a vector of abundance
in each of $m$ subpopulations and $\mathbf{ y}$ is a vector of $n$
observed time series associated with $n$ sites. The number of underlying
processes, $m$, is controlled by the user and not estimated. In the
multi-site scenario, $\mathbf{ Z}$, controls the assignment of survey
sites to subpopulations. For instance, if the population is modeled as
having four independent subpopulations and the first two were surveyed
at one site each and the third was surveyed at two sites, then
$\mathbf{ Z}$ is a $4 \times 3$ matrix with (1, 0, 0, 0) in the first
column, (0, 1, 0, 0) in the second and (0, 0, 1, 1) in the third. In the
`model` argument for the `MARSS` function, we could specify this as
`Z = as.factor(c(1, 2, 3, 3))`. The $\mathbf{ Q}$ matrix controls the
temporal correlation in the process errors for each subpopulation; these
errors could be correlated or uncorrelated. The $\mathbf{ R}$ matrix
controls the correlation structure of observation errors between the $n$
survey sites.

The dataset `harborSeal` in the
[*MARSS*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=MARSS) package contains
survey data for harbor seals on the west coast of the United States. We
can test the hypothesis that the four survey sites in Puget Sound
(Washington state) are better described by one panmictic population
measured at four sites versus four independent subpopulations.

``` r
> dat = t(log(harborSeal[,4:7]))
> harbor1 = MARSS(dat,
+     model = list(Z = factor(rep(1, 4))))
> harbor2 = MARSS(dat, 
+     model = list(Z = factor(1:4)))
```

The default model settings of `Q = "diagonal and unequal"`,
`R = "diagonal and equal"`, and `B = "identity"` are used for this
example. The AICc value for the one subpopulation surveyed at four sites
is considerably smaller than the four subpopulations model. This
suggests that these four sites are within one subpopulation (which is
what one would expect given their proximity and lack of geographic
barriers).

``` r
> harbor1$AICc
```

``` r
[1] -280.0486
```

``` r
> harbor2$AICc
```

``` r
[1] -254.8166
```

We can add a bootstrapped AIC using the function `MARSSaic`.

``` r
> harbor1 = MARSSaic(harbor1, 
+     output = c("AICbp"))
```

We can add a confidence intervals to the estimated parameters using the
function `MARSSparamCIs`.

``` r
> harbor1 = MARSSparamCIs(harbor1)
```

The `MARSS` default is to compute approximate confidence intervals using
a numerically estimated Hessian matrix. Two full model selection
exercises can be found in the MARSS User Guide.

## Analysis of animal movement data

Another application of state-space modeling is identification of true
movement paths of tagged animals from noisy satellite data. Using the
[*MARSS*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=MARSS) package to analyze
movement data assumes that the observations are equally spaced in time,
or that enough `NA`s are included to make the observations spaced
accordingly. The [*MARSS*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=MARSS)
package includes the satellite tracks from eight tagged sea turtles,
which can be used to demonstrate estimation of location from noisy data.

![Figure 2: Estimated movement track for one turtle ("Big Mama") using a
two-dimensional state-space model. The MARSS User Guide shows how to
produce this figure from the satellite data provided with the
package.](bigmama.png){#figure:bigmama width="100%" alt="graphic without alt text"}

The data consist of daily longitude and latitude for each turtle. The
true location is the underlying state $\mathbf{ x}$, which is
two-dimensional (latitude and longitude) and we have one observation
time series for each state process. To model movement as a random walk
with drift in two dimensions, we set $\mathbf{ B}$ equal to an identity
matrix and constrain $\mathbf{ u}$ to be unequal to allow for
non-isotrophic movement. We constrain the process and observation
variance-covariance matrices ($\mathbf{ Q}$, $\mathbf{ R}$) to be
diagonal to specify that the errors in latitude and longitude are
independent. Figure [2](#figure:bigmama) shows the estimated locations
for the turtle named "Big Mama".

## Estimation of species interactions from multi-species data

Ecologists are often interested in inferring species interactions from
multi-species datasets. For example, @Ivesetal2003 analyzed four time
series of predator (zooplankton) and prey (phytoplankton) abundance
estimates collected weekly from a freshwater lake over seven years. The
goal of their analysis was to estimate the per-capita effects of each
species on every other species (predation, competition), as well as the
per-capita effect of each species on itself (density dependence). These
types of interactions can be modeled with a multivariate Gompertz model:

$$\mathbf{ x}_{t} = \mathbf{ B}\mathbf{ x}_{t-1} + \mathbf{ u}+ \mathbf{ w}_{t}; ~~~\mathbf{ w}_{t} \sim \,\textup{\textrm{MVN}}(0, \mathbf{ Q})$$

The $\mathbf{ B}$ matrix is the interaction matrix and is the main
parameter to be estimated. Here we show an example of estimating
$\mathbf{ B}$ using one of the @Ivesetal2003 datasets. This is only for
illustration; in a real analysis, it is critical to take into account
the important environmental covariates, otherwise correlation driven by
a covariate will affect the $\mathbf{ B}$ estimates. We show how to
incorporate covariates in the MARSS User Guide.

The first step is to log-transform and de-mean the data:

``` r
> plank.dat = t(log(ivesDataByWeek[,c("Large Phyto",
+   "Small Phyto","Daphnia","Non-daphnia")]))
> d.plank.dat = (plank.dat - apply(plank.dat, 1,
+     mean, na.rm = TRUE))
```

Second, we specify the MARSS model structure. We assume that the process
variances of the two phytoplankton species are the same and that the
process variances for the two zooplankton are the same. But we assume
that the abundance of each species is an independent process. Because
the data have been demeaned, the parameter $\mathbf{ u}$ is set to zero.
Following @Ivesetal2003, we set the observation error to 0.04 for
phytoplankton and to 0.16 for zooplankton. The model is specified as
follows

``` r
> Z = factor(rownames(d.plank.dat))
> U = "zero"
> A = "zero"
> B = "unconstrained"
> Q = matrix(list(0), 4, 4)
> diag(Q) = c("Phyto", "Phyto", "Zoo", "Zoo")
> R = diag(c(0.04, 0.04, 0.16, 0.16))
> plank.model = list(Z = Z, U = U, Q = Q, 
+                    R = R, B = B, A = A, tinitx=1)
```

We do not specify `x0` or `V0` since we assume the default behavior
which is that the initial states are treated as estimated parameters
with 0 variance.

We can fit this model using `MARSS`:

``` r
> kem.plank = MARSS(d.plank.dat, 
+     model = plank.model)
```

``` r
> B.est = matrix(kem.plank$par$B, 4, 4)
> rownames(B.est) = colnames(B.est) = 
+     c("LP", "SP", "D", "ND")
> print(B.est, digits = 2)
```

``` r
       LP    SP      D    ND
LP  0.549 -0.23  0.096 0.085
SP -0.058  0.52  0.059 0.014
D   0.045  0.27  0.619 0.455
ND -0.097  0.44 -0.152 0.909
```

where `"LP"` and `"SP"` represent large and small phytoplankton,
respectively, and `"D"` and `"ND"` represent the two zooplankton
species, "Daphinia" and "Non-Daphnia", respectively.

Elements on the diagonal of $\mathbf{ B}$ indicate the strength of
density dependence. Values near 1 indicate no density dependence; values
near 0 indicate strong density dependence. Elements on the off-diagonal
of $\mathbf{ B}$ represent the effect of species $j$ on the per-capita
growth rate of species $i$. For example, the second time series (small
phytoplankton) appears to have relatively strong positive effects on
both zooplankton time series. This is somewhat expected, as more food
availability might lead to higher predator densities. The predators
appear to have relatively little effect on their prey; again, this is
not surprising as phytoplankton densities are often strongly driven by
environmental covariates (temperature and pH) rather than predator
densities. Our estimates of $\mathbf{ B}$ are different from those
presented by @Ivesetal2003; in the MARSS User Guide we illustrate how to
recover the estimates in @Ivesetal2003 by fixing elements to zero and
including covariates.

## Dynamic factor analysis

In the previous examples, each observed time series was representative
of a single underlying state process, though multiple time series may be
observations of the same state process. This is not a requirement for a
MARSS model, however. Dynamic factor analysis (DFA) also uses MARSS
models but treats each observed time series as a linear combination of
multiple state processes. DFA has been applied in a number of fields
[e.g. @Harvey1989] and can be thought of as a principal components
analysis for time-series data [@Zuuretal2003a; @Zuuretal2003b]. In a
DFA, the objective is to estimate the number of underlying state
processes, $m$, and the $\mathbf{ Z}$ matrix now represents how these
state processes are linearly combined to explain the larger set of $n$
observed time series. Model selection is used to select the size of $m$
and the objective is to find the most parsimonious number of underlying
trends (size of $m$) plus their weightings ($\mathbf{ Z}$ matrix) that
explain the larger dataset.

To illustrate, we show results from a DFA analysis for six time series
of plankton from Lake Washington [@Hamptonetal2006]. Using model
selection with models using $m=1$ to $m=6$, we find that the best
(lowest AIC) model has four underlying trends, reduced from the original
six. When $m=4$, the DFA observation process then has the following
form:

$$\begin{bmatrix}
    y_{1,t} \\
    y_{2,t} \\
    y_{3,t} \\
    y_{4,t} \\
    y_{5,t} \\
    y_{6,t}     \end{bmatrix} = 
 \begin{bmatrix}
    \gamma_{11}&0&0&0\\
    \gamma_{21}&\gamma_{22}&0&0\\
    \gamma_{31}&\gamma_{32}&\gamma_{33}&0\\
    \gamma_{41}&\gamma_{42}&\gamma_{43}&\gamma_{44}\\
    \gamma_{51}&\gamma_{52}&\gamma_{53}&\gamma_{54}\\
    \gamma_{61}&\gamma_{62}&\gamma_{63}&\gamma_{64}\end{bmatrix} \mathbf{ x}_t +  
  \begin{bmatrix}
    a_1 \\
    a_2 \\
    a_3 \\
    a_4 \\
    a_5 \\
    a_6 \end{bmatrix} + 
 \begin{bmatrix}
    v_{1,t} \\
    v_{2,t} \\
    v_{3,t} \\
    v_{4,t} \\
    v_{5,t} \\
    v_{6,t} \end{bmatrix}    
 \label{eq:dfa2}  (\#eq:dfa2)  $$

Figure [3](#figure:DFA) shows the fitted data with the four state
trajectories superimposed.

The benefit of reducing the data with DFA is that we can reduce a larger
dataset into a smaller set of underlying trends and we can use factor
analysis to identify whether some time series fall into clusters
represented by similar trend weightings. A more detailed description of
dynamic factor analysis, including the use of factor rotation to
intrepret the $\mathbf{ Z}$ matrix, is presented in the MARSS User
Guide.

Washington plankton data. Colors represent estimated state trajectories

species.](DFA.png){#figure:DFA width="100%" alt="graphic without alt text"}

# Summary

We hope this package will provide scientists in a variety of disciplines
some useful tools for the analysis of noisy univariate and multivariate
time-series data, and tools to evaluate data support for different model
structures for time-series observations. Future development will include
Bayesian estimation and constructing non-linear time-series models.
