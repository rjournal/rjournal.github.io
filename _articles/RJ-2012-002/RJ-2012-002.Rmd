title: 'MARSS: Multivariate Autoregressive State-space Models for Analyzing Time-series
  Data'
abstract: MARSS is a package for fitting multivariate autoregressive state-space models
  to time-series data. The MARSS package implements state-space models in a maximum
  likelihood framework. The core functionality of MARSS is based on likelihood maximization
  using the Kalman filter/smoother, combined with an EM algorithm. To make comparisons
  with other packages available, parameter estimation is also permitted via direct
  search routines available in ’optim’. The MARSS package allows data to contain missing
  values and allows a wide variety of model structures and constraints to be specified
  (such as fixed or shared parameters). In addition to model-fitting, the package
  provides bootstrap routines for simulating data and generating confidence intervals,
  and multiple options for calculating model selection criteria (such as AIC).
