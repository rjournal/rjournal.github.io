title: The stringdist Package for Approximate String Matching
abstract: Comparing text strings in terms of distance functions is a common and fundamental
  task in many statistical text-processing applications. Thus far, string distance
  functionality has been somewhat scattered around R and its extension packages, leaving
  users with inconistent interfaces and encoding handling. The stringdist package
  was designed to offer a low-level interface to several popular string distance algorithms
  which have been re-implemented in C for this purpose. The package offers distances
  based on counting q-grams, edit-based distances, and some lesser known heuristic
  distance functions. Based on this functionality, the package also offers inexact
  matching equivalents of Râ€™s native exact matching functions match and %in%.
