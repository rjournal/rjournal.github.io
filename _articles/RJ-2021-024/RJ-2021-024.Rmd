title: User-Specified General-to-Specific and Indicator Saturation Methods
abstract: ' General-to-Specific (GETS) modelling provides a comprehensive, systematic
  and cumulative approach to modelling that is ideally suited for conditional forecasting
  and counterfactual analysis, whereas Indicator Saturation (ISAT) is a powerful and
  flexible approach to the detection and estimation of structural breaks (e.g.Â changes
  in parameters), and to the detection of outliers. To these ends, multi-path backwards
  elimination, single and multiple hypothesis tests on the coefficients, diagnostics
  tests and goodness-of-fit measures are combined to produce a parsimonious final
  model. In many situations a specific model or estimator is needed, a specific set
  of diagnostics tests may be required, or a specific fit criterion is preferred.
  In these situations, if the combination of estimator/model, diagnostics tests and
  fit criterion is not offered in a pre-programmed way by publicly available software,
  then the implementation of user-specified GETS and ISAT methods puts a large programming-burden
  on the user. Generic functions and procedures that facilitate the implementation
  of user-specified GETS and ISAT methods for specific problems can therefore be of
  great benefit. The R package gets is the first software -- both inside and outside
  the R universe -- to provide a complete set of facilities for user-specified GETS
  and ISAT methods: User-specified model/estimator, user-specified diagnostics and
  user-specified goodness-of-fit criteria. The aim of this article is to illustrate
  how user-specified GETS and ISAT methods can be implemented with the R package gets. '
