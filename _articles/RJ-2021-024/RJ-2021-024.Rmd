title: User-Specified General-to-Specific and Indicator Saturation Methods
abstract: 'General-to-Specific (GETS) modelling provides a comprehensive, systematic
  and cumulative approach to modelling that is ideally suited for conditional forecasting
  and counterfactual analysis, whereas Indicator Saturation (ISAT) is a powerful and
  flexible approach to the detection and estimation of structural breaks (e.g. changes
  in parameters), and to the detection of outliers. To these ends, multi path backwards
  elimination, single and multiple hypothesis tests on the coefficients, diagnostics
  tests and goodness-of-fit measures are combined to produce a parsimonious final
  model. In many situations a specific model or estimator is needed, a specific set
  of diagnostics tests may be required, or a specific fit criterion is preferred.
  In these situations, if the combination of estimator/model, diagnostics tests and
  fit criterion is not offered in a pre-programmed way by publicly available software,
  then the implementation of user-specified GETS and ISAT methods puts a large programming-burden
  on the user. Generic functions and procedures that facilitate the implementation
  of user-specified GETS and ISAT methods for specific problems can therefore be of
  great benefit. The R package gets is the first software – both inside and outside
  the R universe – to provide a complete set of facilities for user-specified GETS
  and ISAT methods: User-specified model/estimator, user-specified diagnostics and
  user-specified goodness-of-fit criteria. The aim of this article is to illustrate
  how user-specified GETS and ISAT methods can be implemented with the R package gets.'
