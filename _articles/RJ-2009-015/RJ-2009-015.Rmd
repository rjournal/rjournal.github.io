title: 'asympTest: A Simple R Package for Classical Parametric Statistical Tests and
  Confidence Intervals in Large Samples'
abstract: asympTest is an R package implementing large sample tests and confidence
  intervals. One and two sample mean and variance tests (differences and ratios) are
  considered. The test statistics are all expressed in the same form as the Student
  t-test, which facilitates their presentation in the classroom. This contribution
  also fills the gap of a robust (to non-normality) alternative to the chi square
  single variance test for large samples, since no such procedure is implemented in
  standard statistical software.
