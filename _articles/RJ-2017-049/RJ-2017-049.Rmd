title: The welchADF Package for Robust Hypothesis Testing in Unbalanced Multivariate
  Mixed Models with Heteroscedastic and Non-normal Data
abstract: A new R package is presented for dealing with non-normality and variance
  heterogeneity of sample data when conducting hypothesis tests of main effects and
  interactions in mixed models. The proposal departs from an existing SAS program
  which implements Johansen's general formulation of Welch-James's statistic with
  approximate degrees of freedom, which makes it suitable for testing any linear hypothesis
  concerning cell means in univariate and multivariate mixed model designs when the
  data pose non-normality and non-homogeneous variance. Improved type I error rate
  control is obtained using bootstrapping for calculating an empirical critical value,
  whereas robustness against non-normality is achieved through trimmed means and Winsorized
  variances. A wrapper function eases the application of the test in common situations,
  such as performing omnibus tests on all effects and interactions, pairwise contrasts,
  and tetrad contrasts of two-way interactions. The package is demonstrated in several
  problems including unbalanced univariate and multivariate designs.

# Introduction {#sec:intro}

The problem of testing for mean equality between several groups can be
accomplished using classical techniques such as Student's $t$ test, when
only two groups are compared, or ANOVA when more than two groups are
involved. Both of them have been widely applied in the past in a number
of areas ranging from ecology and biology to psychology, social sciences
and medicine [@psycho-aging-1997; @psychology-pan-fire-2011], although
their use tends to decrease for the reasons mentioned next.

In order for these approaches to work well, the data must satisfy three
conditions, namely independence, normality and homoscedasticity of the
errors. While ANOVA is known to be robust to small departures from
normality, homogeneity of population variances is crucial as concluded
by simulation studies in which these methods have been found to exhibit
type I error rates oscillating from too conservative to extremely
liberal, specially in unbalanced designs leading to very heterogeneous
cell variances. The behaviour depends on the relation between the
variance of the cell with the fewest observations and the number of
observations contained in it [@robustness1987]. Indeed, data from a
number of experiments conducted in the aforementioned research fields
often exhibit non-homogeneous variances. This is not a problem for
one-way designs since the built-in function `oneway.test` in package
*stats* is able to account for different variances. Unfortunately,
real-world studies usually require more complex designs, like the
typical mixed between x within-subjects designs for clinical trials
involving either animals or persons. For both reasons, the application
of simple ANOVA in serious analyses of experimental data is nowadays not
very common.

A distinction should be made here on what homogeneity of variances means
depending on the design being considered [@Lix1995]. In univariate
settings with between-subjects factors only, all the cell variances
should be equal, while in multivariate settings, it refers to the
equality of the population covariance matrices across all cells. In
mixed designs with at least one between-subjects factor, a set of
orthonormalized contrasts on the repeated measures must have common
covariance matrices (sphericity assumption), and all those matrices must
be equal across all cells of the between-subject factors. When both
conditions are met, it is said that multisample sphericity holds
[@Huynh1978].

A number of alternatives have been proposed to overcome the parametric
restrictions [@higgins-book]. Traditionally the most widely used choices
have been nonparametric tests such as Mann-Whitney-Wilcoxon rank sum
test and Kruskal test for two groups, or Wilcoxon signed-rank test and
Friedman test (for which paired versions exist) for more than two
groups. However, they cannot handle multiple factors or interactions.
Generalized Linear Models can deal with multiple factors and
interactions with non-normal data, but require specifying the link
function and are unable to handle repeated measures. Since our study
focuses on the most general models, i.e. those with between-subjects and
within-subjects interactions, the aforementioned tests are not useful.
The generalization of Mixed Models, namely Generalized Linear Mixed
Models [@Bolker2009], do constitute a valid alternative. They present
some drawbacks, though, such as being complex to apply and interpret,
not very widely available, and requiring a particular treatment for each
problem since a suitable link function must be supplied in each case,
which is not always possible.

Two surveys on nonparametric techniques in experimental design can be
found in @Sawilowsky1990 [@SalazarAlvarez2014]. In these works, several
rank transformation variants are emphasized, as they constitute the most
widely used nonparametric approach for detecting interactions
[@Conover2012]. Among them, the Aligned Rank Transform [@higgins-1994],
for which an implementation in R has been made available in package
[*ART*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=ART) [@ARTpkg], is one of the
best performing for this task, keeping type I error rates close to the
theoretical significance level while preserving good power. Although it
has been applied to a split-plot design (one between- and one
within-subjects factor) in @Beasley2002, showing good type I error rates
and power, it lacks a general unified formulation for mixed models with
any number of between- and within-subjects factors that also works in
unbalanced and multivariate settings. @modernSurvey2008
[@heterogeneityReview2012] constitute two more broad surveys (the latter
dealing with variance heterogeneity in depth) covering both classical
nonparametric methods and recent research efforts like the one
implemented here, which is cited in both works.

Some other valid alternatives for nonparametric analysis of any mixed
model are the Improved General Approximation (IGA), the generalization
of Welch-James (WJ) test statistic, the Kenward-Roger correction with
mixed models (KR), and the modified Brown and Forsythe (MBF) procedure.
They all do a correction for the degrees of freedom to account for
heterogeneous variances, hence the name ADF for *approximate degrees of
freedom*. The IGA [@Huynh1978] was specifically developed to account for
multisample sphericity violations in repeated measures designs by
adjusting the critical value, and was generalized to any mixed model by
@Algina1997. Similarly, Welch's non-pooled statistic with approximate
degrees of freedom (ADF) [@Welch1951] was also conceived for this
purpose, using the sample data to estimate the error degrees of freedom.
Several non-pooled ADF statistics have been proposed later but all can
be derived from the general matrix formulation of Welch's statistic
given by @Lix1995 based on @Johansen1980, which makes it applicable for
univariate and multivariate mixed models with an arbitrary number of
effects. @Lix1995 shows how the same statistic can be employed in
different models for both omnibus contrasts (testing whether a given
effect is significant or not) and pairwise comparisons for a given
effect (for every pair of categories of a given effect, testing whether
the response is significantly different for one of the categories
against one another). Generally, the IGA and WJ statistic perform
similarly; however a slight advantage favorable to WJ has been reported
by @Algina1997 in some contexts. The WJ ADF approach has been
successfully tested in nonparametric analysis of a variety of mixed
models; see @Keselman2003 and references therein. The KR correction for
the degrees of freedom can be implemented on top of a conventional mixed
model and performs similarly to the MBF procedure with slight advantage
for the latter [@Vallejo2005]. Both yield reasonably good results. With
respect to the comparison between the MBF and the generalized WJ
statistic, there is no consensus about the results. In most conditions
they perform similarly, but some authors state that MBF is better at
detecting interaction effects when the number of subjects is not high
enough [@Vallejo2001; @Vallejo2006]. However, to the best of our
knowledge, there is no general formulation of MBF for any mixed model
with an arbitrary number of between- x within-subjects factors, although
it has been tested in split-plot designs [@Vallejo2006] (which are
probably the most common design in medicine and particularly in
psychological studies) and factorial designs [@Vallejo2008].

## Software available for robust testing of mixed models not meeting parametric assumptions

@robustEstBook constitutes an important source dealing with robust
estimation. The book is accompanied by an R package called *WRS* [^1]
that implements all the methods reviewed in the book, including the
Welch-James test following Johansen's approach with robust mean
estimators described in sections 7.2, 8.6 and 8.7 which our package
*welchADF* also implements. The functions described in those sections,
`bwtrim, t1way, t1waybt, t2way, t2way, t3way`, include the most common
designs such as one, two and three-way and split-plot (one between x one
within subjects designs) also with bootstrapping and trimming. Although
not included in *WRS2*, the original *WRS* exposes functions
`bbw-, bww-` for between x between x within, and between x within x
within subjects designs, and their trimmed and bootstrap versions. While
useful, they do not provide a uniform, easy-to-use interface in a single
function valid for any mixed design.

There exists a CRAN task force on robust statistical methods[^2].
Unfortunately, none of the packages mentioned there implements the
aforementioned approaches. Nevertheless, packages
[*robustbase*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=robustbase)
[@robustbasepkg], [*robust*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=robust)
[@robuspkg] (by the authors of @robustStatisticsBook) and function
`rlmer` in package
[*robustlmm*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=robustlmm)
[@robustlmmpkg] are some remarkable efforts. The latter implements the
techniques proposed in @kollerThesis for linear mixed models on a basis
of a parametric model having some contaminated data [@robustlmmpaper].
However, it does not focus on testing inherently heterogeneous and
non-normal data. Package
[*nlme*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=nlme) [@nlmepkg] provides a
way of capturing and modeling variance heterogeneity in mixed models
through the argument `weights` of function `lme`, which can be set to
different covariance matrix structures that are fitted from the data.
The well-known package [*lme4*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=lme4)
[@lme4pkg; @lme4paper] is also a good choice for dealing with non-normal
models in presence of within-subjects effects (called generalized linear
mixed models as an extension to generalized linear models where the user
can specify the probabilistic model to be used). Package *glmmADMB* [^3]
[@glmmADMBpkg; @glmmADMBpaper] has a similar purpose.

SAS [@SASguide] implementations of the WJ statistic, MBF statistic
(split-plot and factorial designs only) and IGA do exist; see
@Keselman2003 [@Vallejo2006; @Algina1997] respectively. While SAS is
still widely used mainly in social and biomedical sciences, it is
proprietary software. The same applies to the ERP-PCA software
[@Dien2010] written in Matlab. Interestingly, ERP-PCA incorporates a
Matlab translation of the SAS code described in @Keselman2003 for the WJ
statistic. For these reasons, together with the fast expansion of R and
open-source statistical software in general -closely related to the
growing interest in reproducible research- among researchers of many
different disciplines, we consider the R package introduced here a
useful effort.

## Main contributions

The present work describes an R package called
[*welchADF*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=welchADF) [@welchADFpkg]
that implements Johansen's formulation of the Welch-James test, with two
additional improvements: first, the use of trimmed means and Winsorized
variances to deal with non-normality, and second, the use of bootstrap
for calculating an empirical critical value for achieving better type I
error control. Both aspects are mentioned in @Wilcox1998 and implemented
in @Keselman2003. Trimmed means and Winsorized variances are being used
in medical and behavioral research in the last years; see @adhd2011
[@EarHear2011; @discontinuity2011].

The core of our code is an R translation of the SAS program[^4]
described in @Keselman2003. A new wrapper function has been built on top
of it that poses the following benefits:

-   It can be applied to univariate and multivariate mixed models with
    an arbitrary number of within- and between-subjects effects.

-   It simplifies some common tasks such as performing omnibus tests on
    effects or interactions, multiple pairwise comparisons on the levels
    of one factor, and tetrad contrasts. All of these can be done
    without indicating the contrast matrices, which are automatically
    formed by the program depending on the kind of test required and the
    number of levels found in each factor.

-   It provides a more natural and uniform data input mechanism through
    data frames that do not depend on the model specified. In the
    original SAS code, the input data had to be carefully arranged in
    matrices whose shape had to mirror the experimental design being
    analyzed in each problem, which can be error-prone.

-   It integrates with other similar packages of the R ecosystem through
    a formula interface and also provides additional interfaces that
    accept model objects returned by some commonly used functions such
    as `stats::lm`, `lme4::lmer` and `stats::aov`.

-   It enables selecting one among several built-in p-value correction
    methods when performing multiple pairwise comparisons.

There are several reasons that justify an R implementation of this
particular test:

-   The generalized WJ test described in @Lix1995 [@Keselman2003] has
    good theoretical properties and has proven successful in controlling
    type I error rate while preserving high power. Moreover, the use of
    trimmed means and Winsorized variances can protect both against
    skewness and outliers in the data, as noted by [@Keselman2008]. The
    percentage of trimming can be adjusted to deal with higher ratios of
    outliers and skewness. The statistic is also able to cope with
    heterogeneous variances, which commonly (but not only) arise when
    having very different cell sample sizes. In this sense, one should
    notice the sample size requirement stated right after this list.

-   These two works have received a number of citations, and the
    approach explained there is being used in current research in
    different fields such as medicine [@fMRI-language; @Dien2010],
    psychology [@adhd2011; @psychosis2014; @agematters2015] and
    behavioral research [@women2010], just to cite a few.

-   The function interface is simple and the test can be used in a
    straightforward way for the most common tasks. This may contribute
    positively towards its adoption by the research community, specially
    by researchers with little expertise in statistics, but with an
    understanding of the importance of applying suitable, robust
    techniques when parametric conditions are not met.

-   Despite the existence of different alternatives explained before,
    some of them also implemented in R, these are either not applicable
    to multivariate mixed models with heterogeneous variance or
    non-normal data, or are generally complex and more difficult to use.

The WJ approach also has some disadvantages. The first one is the sample
size needed to assure an effective control of type I error under some
(somewhat extreme) circumstances, specially in repeated-measures
designs, like when the cell with the fewest subjects presents the
largest variance (i.e. cell size and cell variance are negatively
paired). In general, the number of subjects of the smallest cell should
be four or five times greater than the number of repeated measures minus
one, and sometimes even more when testing an interaction. However, when
combined with trimmed means, robustness is increased and some of these
problems are mitigated as a much smaller number of subjects are required
[@Keselman2000]. The second drawback is that *welchADF* is only
applicable to categorical predictors. In case the design has numeric
predictors, the reader may try the packages mentioned in the preceding
section, as well as [*gamm4*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=gamm4)
[@gamm4pkg] and [*mgcv*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=mgcv)
[@mgcvpkg] for fitting generalized additive mixed models.

Finally, the application of bootstrap to contaminated data has been
extensively studied and even questioned by some authors in the past
[@Singh1998], specially regarding numerical instability: some bootstrap
samples that intervene in the computation of the final bootstrapped
estimate may contain a higher proportion of outliers than the general
dataset, and therefore be too heavily influenced by them
[@SalibianBarrera2008]. [@Singh1998] proposed using bootstrapping with
Winsorized observations, which is what we do in this package when
enabling trimming and bootstrapping at the same time, as it provides
some additional benefits. [@SalibianBarrera2008] introduce a fast and
robust bootstrap (FRB) method that improves classical bootstrapping.
Although it has not been incorporated to *welchADF*, it may be done in
the future.

The remainder of this contribution is structured as follows. In first
place, the mathematical background is briefly reviewed. In second place,
we present the function exposed by the package and explain its
arguments, together with some issues regarding the arrangement of the
data. In third place, we address three case studies, namely a univariate
one-way between-subjects design, a two-way factorial design, a mixed
design, and a doubly multivariate design analyzed as a multivariate
mixed design. Finally, we present some conclusions and further work.

# The Welch-James ADF test statistic

Here we summarize the theoretical background given in @Lix1995
[@Keselman2003]. Following the General Linear Model,
$$\mathbf{Y} = \mathbf{X} \boldsymbol\beta + \boldsymbol\xi$$
where $\mathbf{Y}$ is an $N \times p$ matrix of observations on $p$
dependent variables or $p$ repeated measures, $N$ is the sample size,
$\mathbf{X}$ is the design matrix (formed by zeros and ones, such that
rank($\mathbf{X}) = r$ with $r$ being the number of different groups or
cells[^5]), $\boldsymbol\beta$ is an $r \times p$ matrix of non random
(unknown) parameters (population means) and $\boldsymbol\xi$ is an
$N \times p$ matrix of random error components.

If we denote by $\mathbf{Y}_j (j = 1, ..., r$) the submatrix of
$\mathbf{Y}$ that contains the observations of the $n_j$ subjects of the
$j$-th cell, the original parametric model assumes
$\mathbf{Y}_j \sim \mathcal{N}(\boldsymbol\beta_j, \boldsymbol\Sigma_j)$
where $\boldsymbol\beta_j = (\mu_{j1}, ..., \mu_{jp})$ is the $j$-th row
of matrix $\boldsymbol\beta$, and
$\boldsymbol\Sigma_j \neq \boldsymbol\Sigma_{j'}$ when $j \neq j'$.

We proceed to explain how population means and variances are estimated.
The matrix of population means can be estimated by the usual
least-squares approach (Eq. \@ref(eq:OLS)) or by using robust estimation
techniques such as trimming, discussed later. Now, let
$\mathbf{X}_j (j=1,...,r)$ be the $j$-th column of $\mathbf{X}$,
composed of zeros and ones, and let $\mathbf{1}_p$ be a $p \times 1$
vector of ones. Define
$\mathbf{Y}_j = \mathbf{Y} \circ (\mathbf{X}_j \mathbf{1}_p^T)$ as the
$N \times p$ matrix that results of the Hadamard (i.e. element-wise)
product between matrices $\mathbf{Y}$ and $\mathbf{X}_j \mathbf{1}_p^T$.
Then, the following expressions are used to estimate population means
and variances:
$$\begin{aligned}
\hat{\boldsymbol\beta} &=& (\mathbf{X}^T \mathbf{X})^{-1}\mathbf{X}^T \mathbf{Y} \label{OLS} \\
\hat{\boldsymbol\Sigma}_j &=& \frac{(\mathbf{Y}_j - \mathbf{X}_j \hat{\boldsymbol\beta}_j)^T (\mathbf{Y}_j - \mathbf{X}_j \hat{\boldsymbol\beta}_j)}{n_j - 1}
\end{aligned}   (\#eq:OLS)$$
The matrix formulation of the WJ statistic always tests the following
general linear hypothesis:
$$H_0 : \mathbf{R}\boldsymbol\mu = \mathbf{0}$$
with $\mathbf{R} = \mathbf{C} \otimes \mathbf{U}^T$. In this expression,
$\otimes$ is the Kronecker product, $\mathbf{C}$ is a
$df_{\text{C}} \times r$ matrix that indicates the contrasts on the
between-subjects effects, so that
rank($\mathbf{C}) = df_{\text{C}} \leq r$, and $\mathbf{U}$ is a
$p \times df_{\text{U}}$ matrix that indicates the contrasts on the
within-subjects effects, so that rank($\mathbf{U}$) =
$df_{\text{U}} \leq p$. Therefore $\mathbf{R}$ has
$df_{\text{C}} df_{\text{U}}$ rows and $r p$ columns. Note that
$\boldsymbol\mu = \text{vec}(\boldsymbol\beta^T) = (\boldsymbol\beta_1,...\boldsymbol\beta_r)^T$,
which is a column vector with $r p$ elements obtained by stacking the
columns of $\boldsymbol\beta^T$, one on top of another. Matrices
$\mathbf{C}$ and $\mathbf{U}$ determine the type of contrast being
performed, be it an omnibus contrast, a pairwise contrast, etc. We
provide details about the structure of both matrices in the general case
in Section [2.1](#contrastsmatrices).

The generalized Welch-James test statistic presented by Johansen in
@Johansen1980 is
$$\begin{aligned}
T_{\text{WJ}} &=& (\mathbf{R}\hat{\boldsymbol\mu})^T (\mathbf{R}\hat{\mathbf\Sigma}\mathbf{R}^T)^{-1} (\mathbf{R}\hat{\boldsymbol\mu}) \\
\hat{\boldsymbol\Sigma} &=& \text{diag}(\hat{\boldsymbol\Sigma_1}/n_1, ..., \hat{\boldsymbol\Sigma_r}/n_r) \nonumber
\end{aligned}$$
where $\hat{\boldsymbol\mu}$ is an estimate of $\boldsymbol\mu$ (either
with LS or any other technique), and $\hat{\boldsymbol\Sigma}$ is a
block diagonal matrix whose blocks are $\hat{\boldsymbol\Sigma_j}/n_j$.
It is known that $T_{\text{WJ}}/c$ approximately follows an
$F(\nu_1; \nu_2)$ where
$$\begin{aligned}
\nu_1 &=& df_{\text{C}} df_{\text{U}} \quad ; \quad \nu_2 = \nu_1(\nu_1 + 2)/(3A)  \quad ; \quad c = \nu_1 + 2A - (6A)/(\nu_1+2) \\
A &=& \frac{1}{2} \sum_{j=1}^r \frac{\text{tr}\big[ \hat{\boldsymbol\Sigma} \mathbf{R}^T (\mathbf{R} \hat{\boldsymbol\Sigma} \mathbf{R}^T)^{-1} \mathbf{R}\mathbf{Q}_j \big]^2
+ \big( \text{tr}\big[ \hat{\boldsymbol\Sigma} \mathbf{R}^T (\mathbf{R} \hat{\boldsymbol\Sigma} \mathbf{R}^T)^{-1} \mathbf{R}\mathbf{Q}_j \big] \big)^2}{n_j-1}
\end{aligned}$$
where *tr* is the trace of an square matrix (sum of the elements on the
main diagonal), and $\mathbf{Q_j}$ is an $rp \times rp$ matrix
associated with $X_j$ in which the $(s, t)$-th diagonal block of
$\mathbf{Q}_j = \mathbf{I}_p$ when $s = t = j$ and is $\mathbf{0}$
otherwise.

In a between-subjects design (no within-subjects factors), $\mathbf{U}$
must be set to $I_p$ where $p$ is the number of dependent variables (in
univariate designs, it reduces to $\mathbf{U} = 1$). In a
within-subjects design (no between-subjects factors), $\mathbf{C}$ must
be set to 1 both in the univariate and multivariate cases.

## Structure of the contrast matrices {#contrastsmatrices}

The preceding formulation of the model is valid for any type of
contrasts. Most often the user may want to perform two types of
contrasts, namely omnibus contrasts to check whether a given effect or
interaction is statistically significant, and in case it is, post-hoc
pairwise contrasts on one effect or interaction to check whether the
response associated to some of the levels of that factor or interaction
is statistically different than the responses associated to other levels
of the factor.

#### Omnibus contrasts

This test is aimed at checking whether the level adopted by a given
variable of interest (effect or interaction) has an influence over the
response variable. In the simplest case, consider a one-way design,
either univariate or multivariate, whose single factor $A$ has $a$
different levels. Then $\mathbf{C}$ would be an $(a-1)\times a$ matrix
specifying linearly independent contrasts between the levels. We will
call this matrix $\mathbf{C}_A$ (capital $A$) because it is the matrix
we use to conduct an omnibus test on effect $A$. If for instance,
$a = 3$, we would have
$$\mathbf{C}_A = \left[ 
\begin{array}{rrr}
1 & -1 & 0 \\
1 & 0 & -1
\end{array}
\right] \quad ; \quad
\mathbf{U} = \mathbf{I}_p$$
@Algina1984 provide a general formulation to compose matrix $\mathbf{C}$
for omnibus tests on factorial designs with several between-subjects
factors. The same idea, slightly modified, is also valid to compose
matrix $\mathbf{U}$ in designs with several within-subjects factors.
These procedures have been implemented in our *welchADF* package. Let
$C_a$ (non-capital $a$) be the $(a-1)\times a$ matrix of linear
contrasts associated to the $a$ levels of effect $A$. Its rows define
$a-1$ linearly independent contrasts between the levels of $A$. When the
design has no more factors than $A$, then $\mathbf{C}_A = C_a$ as in the
case above. However, when more than one between-subjects factor exists,
then $\mathbf{C}$ has to be properly set according to the factor to
which we want to apply an omnibus test. In those cases, $\mathbf{C}$ is
the Kronecker product of one matrix (or vector) per factor existing in
the design, as follows.

Assume a between-subjects design with four effects $A, B, C, D$. Let
$\mathbf{1}_a^T$ denote a $(1 \times a)$ vector of ones. If we want to
perform an omnibus contrast on a main effect, say $B$, then
$\mathbf{C} = \mathbf{C}_B = \mathbf{1}_a^T \otimes C_b \otimes \mathbf{1}_c^T \otimes \mathbf{1}_d^T$.
In other words, if the factor matches the effect being tested, the
corresponding contrast matrix appears in the product; otherwise, a
vector of ones appears. The same applies to interactions. If we want to
test the $B \times D$ interaction, for instance, we would have
$\mathbf{C} = \mathbf{C}_{BD} = \mathbf{1}_a^T \otimes C_b \otimes \mathbf{1}_c^T \otimes C_d$.
Since factors $B$ and $D$ are involved in the interaction $BD$ being
tested, their contrast matrices appear in the product, while a vector of
ones appears in the positions of the remaining factors of the design.

For within-subjects designs a similar rule applies. Assume that now $A$
is a within-subjects factor, and let $U_a = C_a^T$, so that the columns
of $U_a$ define $a-1$ linearly independent contrasts between the levels
of $A$. In a within-subjects design with several factors, the transposes
of the $U$ contrast matrices of those factors involved in the effect or
interaction being tested appear in the Kronecker product; otherwise, a
row vector of ones is used in that place as explained before. If the
design is multivariate with $p$ dependent response variables, an
additional factor $\mathbf{I}_p$ always appears in the last place of the
product. At the end, the result of the Kronecker product must be
transposed again to obtain $\mathbf{U}$. For example, in a two-factor
within-subjects multivariate design, the $\mathbf{U}$ matrices for
conducting ominbus tests on effects $A$, $B$ and the interaction $AB$
would be, respectively,
$\mathbf{U}_A = (U_a^T \otimes \mathbf{1}_b^T \otimes \mathbf{I}_p)^T$,
$\mathbf{U}_B = (\mathbf{1}_a^T \otimes U_b^T \otimes \mathbf{I}_p)^T$,
and $\mathbf{U}_{AB} = (U_a^T \otimes U_b^T \otimes \mathbf{I}_p)^T$.

In case we want to test a main effect (either a between- or a
within-subjects effect) in a design containing both between- and
within-subjects factors, the same rules apply: $\mathbf{C}$ and
$\mathbf{U}$ are composed separately, and one of them will (for sure) be
the result of the Kronecker product of vectors of ones only (including
$\mathbf{I}_p$ as well when constructing $\mathbf{U}$ if the design is
multivariate). Finally, if we want to test an interaction involving one
or more between-subjects factors and one or more within-subjects,
$\mathbf{C}$ must be formed as if we were testing only the
between-subjects factors involved in the mixed interaction, and
$\mathbf{U}$ as if testing the within-subjects factors, following the
rules explained above.

#### Pairwise contrasts

Now for a given effect, we are aimed at testing for every pair of
categories of the effect whether the response is significantly different
for one of the categories against one another. The procedure is similar
to the omnibus contrasts. The only difference is that contrast matrices
$C_a$ and $U_a$ associated to an effect $A$ are replaced by contrast
vectors, as follows. When testing for significant differences between
factor levels $j$ and $j'$ of an effect $A$, either $C_a$ is replaced by
a row vector $\mathbf{c}_{jj'}$ if $A$ is a between-subjects factor, or
$U_a$ is replaced by a column vectors $\mathbf{u}_{jj'}$ if $A$ is a
within-subjects factor. In a pairwise contrast vector, all positions are
set to 0 except for those corresponding to the factor levels $j$ and
$j'$ being tested, which are set to 1 and -1 respectively. These vectors
are then used in the corresponding positions of the Kronecker products
described before. For probing interactions (once the omnibus test on
such interaction proved significant), tetrad contrasts have been
implemented in our package. The null hypothesis being tested in a tetrad
contrast involving two factors $A$ and $B$, from which the interaction
between levels $j$ and $j'$ from $A$, and $k$ and $k'$ from $B$ is being
tested, can be written as
$$H_{jj';kk'} : (\mu_{jk} - \mu_{jk'}) - (\mu_{j'k} - \mu_{j'k'}) = 0$$

## Trimmed means and Winsorized variances

Trimmed means help mitigate the effects of non-normality. When
least-squares means are substituted by trimmed means, the null
hypotheses being tested are the equality of population trimmed means:
$\mathbf{R}\boldsymbol\mu^{(t)} = \mathbf{0}$. Let
$Y_{(1)j} \leq Y_{(2)j} \leq ... \leq Y_{(n_j)j}$ be the sorted
observations of the $j$-th group, and $g_j = \lceil \gamma n_j \rceil$
with $\gamma$ being the proportion of observations to be trimmed in each
tail of the distribution. Therefore the sample size for the $j$-th group
becomes $h_j = n_j - 2 g_j$, and its sample trimmed mean is computed by
averaging the $h_j$ central observations of that group:
$$\hat{\mu}_j^{(t)} = \frac{1}{h_j} \sum_{k=g_j + 1}^{n_j - g_j} Y_{(k)j}$$
Some authors suggest using 20 % trimming.

The sample Winsorized mean is a similar measure that is computed by
replacing all observations smaller than $Y_{(g_j + 1)j}$ (i.e. the 20th
percentile) by that value, and those larger than $Y_{(n_j - g_j)j}$
(i.e. the 80th percentile) by that value, and then averaging over all
the (modified) observations. In the $j$-th group:
$$\hat{\mu}_j^{(W)} = \frac{1}{n_j} \sum_{i=1}^{n_j} X_{ij}, \quad \text{where} \quad 
X_{ij} = \left\{ \begin{align}
	Y_{(g_j+1)j}		&	if	& Y_{ij} \leq Y_{(g_j+1)j} \\
	Y_{ij}				&	if	& Y_{(g_j+1)j} < Y_{ij} < Y_{(n_j - g_j)j} \\
	Y_{(n_j - g_j)j}	&	if	& Y_{ij} \geq Y_{(n_j - g_j)j}
\end{align}
\right.$$
This measure is required to compute the sample Winsorized variance:
$$\hat{\sigma}_j^{2(W)} = \frac{1}{n_j - 1} \sum_{i=1}^{n_j} (X_{ij} - \hat{\mu}_j^{(W)})^2$$
Therefore, in order to compute the trimmed version of the WJ statistic,
$T_{WJ}^{(t)}$, trimmed means replace least-squares means, Winsorized
variances replace least-squares variances, and the new sample sizes
$h_j$ replace the original $n_j$ in all groups. Past studies have found
the trimmed version of the WJ statistic to be more robust and provide
better type I error control to non-normality, also in more complex
designs; see @Keselman2000 and references therein.

## Bootstrapping to obtain an empirical critical value

After computing the cell trimmed means, let
$C_{ij} = Y_{ij} - \hat{\mu}_j^{(t)}$, i.e. the $C_{ij}$ are shifted
observations so that the null hypothesis of equal trimmed means is true
in the sample. Repeat $B$ times the next two steps ($B$ is the
user-supplied number of bootstrap simulations): (i) for each cell,
generate a bootstrap sample of size $n_j$ by sampling with replacement
from the original sample. When the bootstrap samples of all the cells
are put together, an $N$-sample bootstrap dataset is obtained; (ii)
compute the value $F^{*(t)} = T_{WJ}^{(t)}/c$ on the bootstrap dataset.
Sort the $B$ values obtained in ascending order,
$F^{*(t)}_{(1)} \leq ... \leq F^{*(t)}_{(B)}$. An estimate of an
appropriate critical value is $F^{*(t)}_{(a)}$ where $a = (1 - \alpha)B$
rounded to the nearest integer. This critical value should be compared
with $T_{WJ}^{(t)}/c$ computed on the original data. The null hypothesis
$\mathbf{R}\boldsymbol\mu^{(t)} = \mathbf{0}$ of trimmed means equality
will be rejected if $T_{WJ}^{(t)} /c \geq F^{*(t)}_{(a)}$.

The process explained before applies to omnibus contrasts. For focused
contrasts such as pairwise tests on marginal means, the same idea with
minor modifications is used. For more details as well as a
generalization to other designs, see @Keselman2003 and references
therein.

## Effect size and confidence intervals

As stated in @Keselman2008 [@APAManual], it is now widely recommended to
report an estimate of the effect size when performing a hypothesis test.
Many different measures exist for this purpose, although few of them are
valid for non-homogeneous variances. The approach implemented in our
package was proposed in @Keselman2008 and has the following formulation
for the case of two groups:
$$\label{eq.effect.size}
\hat{\delta}^{(R)}_j = \eta \frac{\hat{\mu}^{(t)}_2 - \hat{\mu}^{(t)}_1}{\hat{\sigma}^{(W)}_j}   (\#eq:eq-effect-size)$$
Note this approach uses trimmed means and Winsorized standard deviation
and for that reason, it is robust to non-normality. Factor $\eta$ stands
for a scaling factor of the Winsorized standard deviation. In case 20 %
trimming is used (as recommended), $\eta = .642$ which is the Winsorized
standard deviation for a 20% trimmed standard normal distribution. In
our code, $\eta$ is computed according to the percentage of trimming
indicated by the user. For building a robust CI around this value, a
percentile bootstrap method is run to determine the empirical bounds of
the interval as recommended in @Keselman2008.

# An R implementation of the WJ statistic

The WJ test is implemented in our package as an S3 generic called
`welchADF.test`. The name has been chosen to be compliant with other
existing tests such as `t.test, wilcox.test`, etc. The function receives
parameters to modulate its behaviour, such as the type of contrast to be
performed (omnibus or pairwise), whether trimming should be employed or
not, and if employed, the percentage of data to be trimmed at each side,
and whether bootstrapping should be used or not. The default S3 method
expects a `data.frame` in the `formula` parameter, but additional S3
methods are provided for classes `formula`, `lm`, `lmer` and `aov`,
which allow our package to integrate well with other linear models
functions, as described later in this section.

The prototype of the S3 default method is

``` r
welchADF.test(formula, response, between.s, within.s = NULL, subject = NULL, 
     contrast = c("omnibus", "all.pairwise"), effect = NULL,
     correction = c("hochberg", "holm"), trimming = FALSE, per = 0.2,
     bootstrap = FALSE, numsim_b = 999, effect.size = FALSE, numsim_es = 999, 
     scaling = TRUE, standardize.effsz = TRUE, alpha = 0.05, seed = 0, ...)
```

We summarize below the meaning of the arguments; the reader may refer to
the package documentation for further detail. Note only the three first
arguments are required.

-   `formula` is a data frame object containing the observations and the
    level combination to which they correspond. The next four arguments
    refer to the column names.

-   `response, between.s, within.s, subject` are strings (or string
    vectors) indicating the column names for the response, the
    between-subjects effect(s), the within-subject(s) effects, and the
    subject column that stores which subject corresponds to each row
    (hence it cannot be a vector but a single string). In case the
    design is multivariate, the response will be a vector of columns,
    one for each response variable. A sample data frame is displayed in
    Table [1](#tab:dataframe). Each cell $A_i B_j$ has $n_{A_i B_j}$
    subjects, and $n_{A_i B_j} \cdotp x \cdotp w$ rows in the data
    frame. Here, $N = \sum_{i, j} n_{A_i B_j}$ subjects.

-   `contrast` refers to the type of contrast to be performed. Both in
    `"omnibus"` and `"all.pairwise"` contrasts, the corresponding
    contrasts matrices are automatically computed as described in
    Section [2.1](#contrastsmatrices).

-   `effect` is the effect (i.e. column name) involved in the selected
    contrast. If `effect` is a vector with length 2 or greater and
    `contrast = "omnibus"`, then an omnibus contrast on an interaction
    effect will be tested involving simultaneously all the effects of
    the vector. If `contrast = "all.pairwise"`, then `effect` must have
    length 1 or 2 to indicate a single effect or a two-way interaction
    to which tetrad contrasts will be applied; otherwise an error will
    be thrown. If left blank, the contrast will be applied separately to
    all of the existing effects and their interactions.

-   The rest of arguments specify whether trimmed means and Winsorized
    variances will be used and the percentage of trimming
    (`use.robust.estimators,` `per`), whether bootstrapping should be
    used to compute an empirical critical value and how many iterations
    to do (`use.bootstrap,` `numsim_b`), and whether the effect size and
    a confidence interval should be computed (again via bootstrap).
    Effect size allows the choice of using scaling (`scaling = TRUE`) or
    not (if not, $\eta = 1$ in Eq. \@ref(eq:eq-effect-size)) and the
    number of effect-size bootstrap simulations (`effect.size,`
    `scaling,` `numsim_es,` `loc1,` `loc2`).

The aforementioned function is an R wrapper that configures the
parameters needed for each type of problem by two private functions,
which lie at the core of our package. Both are R translations of the SAS
functions `wjglm` and `bootcom` and have been named almost the same.
Function `wjglm` is used in all cases (including those in which
bootstrapping is needed), except when bootstrap is applied to obtain an
empirical critical value for a *family* of contrasts. A modification of
function `bootcom` is only invoked in that case in order to control
family-wise type I error rate (FWER) via percentile bootstrapping. This
scenario arises when performing all pairwise contrasts or tetrad
contrasts via bootstrap (i.e.
`contrast = "all.pairwise", bootstrap = TRUE`).

:::

The prototype of the S3 method for class `formula` is as usual:

`welchADF.test(formula, data, subset, ...)`

where `data` is a data frame following the same rules as described above
for the `formula` parameter of the default method, `subset` is an
indexing vector to indicate which rows of `data` should be used (all by
default), and `...` stands for the rest of arguments accepted by
`welchADF.test.default` and described above to configure the behavior of
the test. As with other models, the terms in `formula` are first sought
in `data` and then in the environment of the formula. Note, however,
that only between-subjects and within-subjects effects and interactions
can be specified together with a Subject column when conducting a WJ
test, but no model is fit to the data. For this reason, `formula` should
be understood only as a way to indicate the factors involved and their
nature (between- or within-subjects) but not as a description of a
particular model structure. The presence or absence of an interaction in
the formula only affects which effects are tested when
`contrast = "omnibus", effect = NULL`; otherwise it does not affect at
all. The structure should mirror that of the *lme4* package, e.g.

`welchADF.test(cbind(visits, time, latency) ~ nurs*tunnel + (tunnel|Subject), miceData)`

means that there is a multivariate response composed of three correlated
variables `visits`, `time`, `latency`, and the design has one
between-subjects factor `nurs` (because it appears outside but not
inside the parenthesis term) and one within-subjects factor `tunnel`
because it appears inside the parenthesis. While a within-subjects
effect may appear outside the parenthesis to indicate an interaction
with a between-subjects effect, between-subjects must not appear inside
the parenthesis.

The function returns an object of class `welchADFt`, which is actually a
tagged list of lists, one sub-list per effect in an omnibus contrast, or
per category involved a pairwise contrast of a given effect. The call is
also stored as the last element of the upper-level list with the name
`call`, no matter the S3 method employed (be it `welchADF.test.default`,
or the ones for class `formula, lm, aov` or `lmer`). This allows to
implement S3 method `update` for class `welchADFt`, no matter which S3
method was called to calculate the model object [^6]. Each sub-list has
elements named `welch.T, numeratorDF, denominatorDF, contrast.matrix,`
`mean.vector, sigma.matrix` which store, respectively, the value of the
$T_{WJ}/c$ statistic (or $T_{WJ}^{(t)}/c$ if the trimmed version was
used), the approximate degrees of freedom of the numerator and
denominator, the contrast matrix $\mathbf{R}$ obtained as
$\mathbf{R} = \mathbf{C} \otimes \mathbf{U}^T$, and the estimates
$\hat{\boldsymbol\mu}$ and $\hat{\boldsymbol\Sigma}$. It also stores the
user arguments when the function was called and, in case the user asked
for the effect size, it provides the effect size along with a confidence
interval. Refer to the package documentation for further detail.

The package implements S3 methods `summary`, `format` and `print` for
objects of class `welchADFt`, as well as other methods widely used on
model objects such as `confint` to get confidence intervals of the
effect size (in case the user requested to compute it), `model.frame` to
extract the input data frame, and `formula` to extract the formula (not
available if the object was generated by `welchADF.test.default`).

# Case studies

All the datasets analyzed in this section were mentioned in examples
designed by the authors of the SAS implementation [@Lix1995], and have
also been included in our R package. For that reason it is not necessary
to explicitly read them from text files. They are described in detail in
the package documentation.

## Univariate one-way between-subject design

The dataset was artificially created by Lix et al. and can be downloaded
from her personal website[^7]. The data recreate those reported by a
real study on perception and concentration, on which 42 students were
given several puzzles to be solved. The students are divided into three
balanced groups as they had previously been asked to imagine solving
puzzles in the distant future, near future, or not to imagine anything
at all (control group). The response variable represents the number of
puzzles each student was able to solve, out of 12. The data are
delivered in our package in a variable named `perceptionData`.

This design presents one between-subjects variable, namely the Group to
which the student belongs, and no within-subjects variables as each
student is measured on only one response variable and then the student
is never measured again. The following R commands demonstrate the types
of analyses that can be done with this dataset. The results can be
checked on the PDF file of the footnote.

``` r
> str(perceptionData) 
'data.frame':   42 obs. of  2 variables: 
 \$ Group: Factor w/ 3 levels "control","distantFuture",..: 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 ... 
 \$ y    : int  7 5 8 9 8 8 7 7 6 2 ... 
> omnibus_LSM <- welchADF.test(perceptionData, response = "y", between.s = "Group")

> summary(omnibus_LSM, verbose = TRUE)
Call:
   welchADF.test(formula = perceptionData, response = "y", between.s = "Group")

Welch-James Approximate DF Test (Least squares means & variances)

```

The omnibus contrast on the between-subjects effect Group determined it
is not statistically significant when using least-square means. But if
we apply trimming:

``` r
> omnibus_trimmed <- update(omnibus_LSM, trimming = TRUE)
> omnibus_trimmed_boot <- update(omnibus_trimmed, bootstrap = TRUE, seed = 12345)
> summary(omnibus_trimmed)
Call:
   welchADF.test(formula = perceptionData, response = "y", between.s = "Group", 
    trimming = TRUE)

      WJ statistic Numerator DF Denominator DF Pr(>WJ)  
Group        4.975            2          16.11 0.02076 *
---
Signif. codes:  0 '***' 0.001 '**' 0.01 '*' 0.05 '.' 0.1 ' ' 1
```

By applying trimmed means and Winsorized variances we do get a
statistically significant result. Hence, since the omnibus test was
significant on this factor, we do pairwise comparisons on it in order to
test which pairs of group levels make the associated groups of responses
statistically different. Since the result was obtained with trimming, we
continue with it in pairwise comparisons. Only the result of
non-bootstrapped trimming is displayed here.

``` r
> pairwise_trimmed <- welchADF.test(y ~ Group, data = perceptionData, effect = "Group", 
  contrast = "all.pairwise", trimming = TRUE, effect.size = TRUE)
> pairwise_trimmed_boot <- update(pairwise_trimmed, bootstrap = TRUE, seed = 12345)
> summary(pairwise_trimmed)
Call:
   welchADF.test(formula = y ~ Group, data = perceptionData, effect = "Group", 
    contrast = "all.pairwise", trimming = TRUE, effect.size = TRUE)

                         WJ statistic Numerator DF Denominator DF eff.size adj.pval  
control:nearFuture           0.004398            1         10.089 -0.02674   0.9484  
distantFuture:nearFuture     0.876366            1          9.778  0.38620   0.7435  
control:distantFuture       10.088968            1         17.510 -1.09981   0.0161 *
---
Signif. codes (Hochberg p-values):  0 '***' 0.001 '**' 0.01 '*' 0.05 '.' 0.1 ' ' 1
```

The output shows that the responses associated to the control group
significantly differs from those associated to the distantFuture group.
The confidence intervals on the effect size can be retrieved as

``` r
> confint(pairwise_trimmed)
                           2.5 %   97.5 %
control:nearFuture       -0.8208  0.85290
distantFuture:nearFuture -0.3402  1.74365
control:distantFuture    -2.2571 -0.09678
```

An important issue arises in this example that justifies again the use
of trimmed estimators. As can be seen in the omnibus tests, the Group is
not significant with Least-squares means but it is when we use trimmed
means and Winsorized variances. This yields a significant result which
could not be detected unless trimming is applied. As the result of the
omnibus test with trimmed means is significant, we proceed to the
pairwise comparisons using trimming as well. This yields that `control`
and `distantFuture` have associated significantly different values of
the number of puzzles solved by the students on average.

## Two-way factorial (between-subjects) design

Once again, this dataset[^8] was artificially created by Lix et al.
Quoting from the PDF, the author used summary data presented by
@Wicherts2005. These authors examined the effects of stereotype threat
on women's mathematics ability. Study participants were assigned to one
of six groups defined by crossing the independent factors of test
condition (control, nullified, stereotype threat) and sex (male,
female). Originally there were four different tests administered to
study participants (arithmetic, number series, word problems, and sums
tests) the dataset contains only scores for the arithmetic test (out of
40) because these scores exhibited a greater magnitude of variance
heterogeneity than scores for the other tests. It is an unbalanced
design with cell sizes ranging from 45 to 50 participants, and a total
sample size of 283. The data are delivered in our package in a variable
named `womenStereotypeData`.

The output of the omnibus tests using robust estimators (trimmed means
and Winsorized variances) with and without bootstrapping is shown in
first place. Since the interaction between \"condition\" and \"sex\" is
significant according to trimmed means, the post-hoc pairwise
comparisons (tetrad contrasts) are shown using trimmed means with and
without bootstrapping. The results match those presented in pages 5 and
6 of the PDF.

``` r
> omnibus_LSM <- welchADF.test(womenStereotypeData, response = "y", between.s = 
  c("condition", "sex"), contrast = "omnibus")
> omnibus_trimmed <- update(omnibus_LSM, trimming = TRUE)
> summary(omnibus_LSM)
Call:
   welchADF.test(formula = womenStereotypeData, response = "y", 
    between.s = c("condition", "sex"), contrast = "omnibus")

In this case, the omnibus test is unclear when using least-square means
(p-values only slightly greater than the common significance threshold
of 0.05 according to the summary of `omnibus_LSM`) but trimming helps
make things clearer. This results in both factors and their interaction
being statistically significant at a significance level of 0.05 (see the
summary of `omnibus_trimmed` above).

Since the omnibus test confirms the significance of all effects,
pairwise comparisons should be done on all of them. Due to space
constraints, only the two-way `condition:sex` interaction effect was
probed (as `effect = c("condition", "sex")` in the call to create the
`pairwise_LSM` object that was subsequently updated to account for
trimming and bootstrapping). Pairwise contrasts on two-way interactions
are also known as tetrad contrasts.

``` r
> pairwise_trimmed <- welchADF.test(y ~ condition*sex, data = womenStereotypeData, 
  contrast = "all.pairwise", effect = c("condition", "sex"), trimming = TRUE)
> pairwise_trimmed_boot <- update(pairwise_trimmed, bootstrap = TRUE, seed = 12345)

```

Pairwise comparisons on the condition:sex interaction with trimmed
bootstrapped means reveal only one significant interaction between the
pairs of levels `control:nullified` and `female:male`.

## Multivariate (mixed) between- $\times$ within-subjects design

The problem and the data are described in @Keselman2003. The data
represent the reaction times in milliseconds of children with
attention-deficit hyperactivity (ADHD) and normal children when they are
presented four kinds of inputs: a target alone or an arrow stimuli
incongruent, congruent and neutral to the target. According to the
authors, the dataset was artificially generated from the summary
measures given in the original study by @Jonkman1999, in groups of 20
and 10 children to create an unbalanced design. The data are delivered
in our package in two variables named `adhdData` and `adhdData2`.

#### One-way multivariate vs univariate mixed model

This problem can be approached in two different ways: (a) as a one-way
multivariate design, which would be the non-parametric equivalent of
MANOVA (multivariate ANOVA), or (b) as a univariate mixed model having
one between-subjects factor (the student's group) and one
within-subjects factor (with four levels, namely the four stimuli
measured in every single student). In case we were analysing the data
under parametric assumptions, the second option requires sphericity
while MANOVA does not (although it needs more data). On the other hand,
mixed models are able to capture the covariance structure of the
dependent variables and can be generalized to any number of factors. An
in-depth discussion on this topic can be found in chapter 9 of
@Maxwell2004. [@Keselman2003] (page 593) insist on using trimmed means
and/or bootstrapping with this kind of models in order to overcome
deviations from sphericity.

Our package admits both types of analysis. When dealing with a one-way
multivariate design, the data must be formated as in
Figure [1](#tabla:multivariate-vs-mixed)(a), while a mixed model
requires the more systematic format of
Figure [1](#tabla:multivariate-vs-mixed)(b) which is valid for an
arbitrary amount of factors of both types. As done in their paper, we
will analyze this dataset as a mixed model in which the stimuli are an
explicit within-subjects factor.

#### Implicit within-subjects effect

The package admits a third way to indicate the within-subjects effects
that simplifies its use. It is common to have a dataset with a
within-subjects effect expressed in the form of
Figure [1](#tabla:multivariate-vs-mixed)(a). In this case, we may want
to consider the within-subjects effect underlying the multivariate
response. Reshaping this file to match the structure of
Figure [1](#tabla:multivariate-vs-mixed)(b) would require some effort by
the user. To avoid this, the function allows indicating that the
multivariate response is actually an implicit within-subjects effects by
including the word `"multivariate"` in the vector of within-subjects
column names (if this argument was empty, then we just set the argument
`within.s =` ` "multivariate"`). This can be generalized as follows: if
we have $K$ within-subjects effects, we can have $K-1$ columns in the
data with their explicit names and levels, and leave one effect to be
indicated in the multivariate response. In that case, we set
`within.s = ``c("within1",` `"within2",` `..., ` `"within-k-1",`
`"multivariate")` and pass a multivariate response vector argument
because the data must have one response column per level of the $K$-th
within-subjects effect. In the code below, the variables with the
termination `_multi` show the equivalent calls. Unless we change the
model itself (i.e. consider a mixed model or a multivariate one-way
model with no within-subjects factor), the results obtained are the same
in all types of analyses (omnibus, pairwise, etc), no matter the
structure of the input data file. We demonstrate all the possibilities
below.

``` r

  "Congruent", "Neutral", "Incongruent"), within.s = "multivariate", between.s = "Group", 
  contrast = "omnibus")

> omnibus_trimmed_formula <- update(omnibus_LSM_mixed_formula, trimming = TRUE)
> omnibus_trimmed_boot <- update(omnibus_trimmed_formula, bootstrap = TRUE, seed = 12345)
```

Above we have demonstrated the possibilities of an omnibus contrast to
both arrangements of the data. The first and third models assume a mixed
model, where the within-subjects factor is implicit in
`omnibus_LSM_mixed_implicit` (using `adhdData`) and explicit in
`omnibus_LSM_mixed` (using `adhdData2`). The second model assumes a
multivariate one-way model with no within-subjects effects. The model
`omnibus_LSM_mixed_formula` assumes an explicit mixed model described by
a formula. The formula interface can be fitted only to data in long
format like `adhdData2`. Finally, this model is updated to include
trimming, and the resulting updated model is updated again to include
bootstrapping as well.

``` r

   welchADF.test(formula = adhdData, response = c("TargetAlone", 
    "Congruent", "Neutral", "Incongruent"), between.s = "Group",

The results match those presented in @Keselman2003, page 594. The only
significant effect is the Stimulus, which acts as the within-subjects
factor. When we consider a one-way multivariate design, with no
within-subjects factor, then the Group (the between-subjects factor) is
deemed not significant. In order perform all pairwise comparisons
between the levels of Stimulus, we proceed as follows (only the
bootstrap results are shown due to space constraints). The comparison is
statistically significant when the value of the WJ statistic is greater
than or equal to the bootstrap critical value. In this case, there were
two significant differences, namely Incongruent vs TargetAlone, and
Incongruent vs Congruent, as mentioned in page 595 of the aforementioned
work.

``` r
> pairwise_trimmed_formula <- update(omnibus_trimmed_formula, contrast = "all.pairwise", 
  effect = "Stimulus")

    effect = "Stimulus", bootstrap = TRUE, seed = 123456)

Bootstrap critical value: 8.577
```

Note that, when using the implicit within-subjects effect format, we
have to specify `effect =` `"multivariate"` to indicate that the effect
to be tested is the within-subjects effect, even though there is no
column with such name in our data. In case we are using the formula
interface, this is not available because formula terms must strictly
correspond to column names or variables in the environment of the
formula.

## Multivariate within-subjects design (doubly multivariate)

The three case studies addressed before are probably the most common in
practice. Nevertheless, and with the aim of demonstrating the
flexibility of the *welchADF* package, we present here an additional,
not-so-common setting, namely a doubly multivariate design also proposed
by @Lix1995. In general, this design arises when several dependent
variables are measured for each individual at several time points (every
variable measured at each time point), or under different conditions;
the latter is the case of the example addressed below.

We could not access the data employed by Lix, hence we have analyzed
data from [@Wuensch1992] which are freely available in the author's
website[^9]. In this experiment, wild strain house mice were, at birth,
cross fostered onto house mouse (Mus), deer mouse (Peromyscus) or rat
(Rattus) nursing mothers. Ten days after weaning, each subject was
tested in an apparatus that allowed it to enter four different tunnels:
one scented with clean pine shavings, and the other three tunnels with
shavings bearing the scent of Mus, Peromyscus, or Rattus respectively.
Three variables were measured for each tunnel: the number of visits to
the tunnel during a twenty minute test, the time spent by each subject
in each of the four tunnels and the latency to first visit of each
tunnel.

In this design, the type of nursing mother is a between-subjects factor.
The within-subjects factor is scent, with four levels (clean, Mus,
Peromyscus, and Rattus). The multivariate response is composed of
visits, time, and latency for each tunnel. With this approach, the
multivariate response is not treated as another within-subjects factor.
The data are delivered in our package in a variable named `miceData`.

``` r
> head(miceData)
  Subject nurs       tunnel visits   time latency
1       1  Mus        Clean      6 721.35  207.90
2       1  Mus        MusSc      4 318.15   26.78
3       1  Mus PeromyscusSc      2  48.83 1025.33
4       1  Mus     RattusSc      0   0.00 1212.75
5       2  Mus        Clean      8 119.70  685.13
6       2  Mus        MusSc      7 207.90  113.40
```

We first do an omnibus contrast. In the second call we demonstrate how
the formula interface can be used in this design to obtain exactly the
same result.

``` r
> omnibus_LSM <- welchADF.test(miceData, response = c("visits", "time", "latency"), 
  between.s = "nurs", within.s = "tunnel", subject = "Subject", contrast = "omnibus")
> omnibus_LSM_formula <- welchADF.test(cbind(visits, time, latency) ~ nurs*tunnel +
  (tunnel | Subject), data = miceData)

> summary(omnibus_LSM_formula)

   welchADF.test(formula = cbind(visits, time, latency) ~ nurs * 
    tunnel + (tunnel | Subject), data = miceData)

```

The least-square means were able to deem all effects statistically
significant. Therefore we move to pairwise contrasts for each of the
effects, with and without trimming. The pairwise results of the
interaction term are not displayed as they consist of a large table.

``` r

The pairwise comparisons using least-squares means are able to detect
significant differences only between MusSc and RattusSc in the tunnel
effect, and the trimmed-bootstrapped comparison also supports this fact
and negates significant differences for any other pair of levels.
Regarding the nurs effect, the LSM comparison reveals significant
differences in Mus vs Rattus and also in Peromyscus vs Rattus, but the
trimmed-bootstrapped only agrees with the latest.

# Conclusions and further work {#sec:conclusions}

This contribution has demonstrated the applicability of the new
*welchADF* package in a variety of experimental designs, ranging from
the most simple one, namely a univariate one-way between-subjects
design, to a more exotic one like a doubly-multivariate design. The
unified approach of [@Johansen1980] that has been implemented here leads
to a great ease of use for any case study. We have shown in the example
code that specifying the factors involved in the design and the type of
analysis are done in a straightforward way, and then the code
automatically generates the contrast matrices needed and runs the test,
no matter how complex the user's design is. Therefore, researchers from
other areas may find it more friendly and hence, our effort may
contribute to the diffusion of the Welch-James ADF test in applied
studies.

In the future, an enhancement may be added so that custom contrasts can
be done in addition to the most common omnibus and pairwise contrasts.
This requires designing a simple, yet powerful mechanism for the user to
describe the desired test in the function arguments.
