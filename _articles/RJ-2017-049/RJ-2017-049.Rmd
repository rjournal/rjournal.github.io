title: The welchADF Package for Robust Hypothesis Testing in Unbalanced Multivariate
  Mixed Models with Heteroscedastic and Non-normal Data
abstract: A new R package is presented for dealing with non-normality and variance
  heterogeneity of sample data when conducting hypothesis tests of main effects and
  interactions in mixed models. The proposal departs from an existing SAS program
  which implements Johansen’s general formulation of Welch-James’s statistic with
  approximate degrees of freedom, which makes it suitable for testing any linear hypothesis
  concerning cell means in univariate and multivariate mixed model designs when the
  data pose non-normality and non-homogeneous variance. Improved type I error rate
  control is obtained using bootstrapping for calculating an empirical critical value,
  whereas robustness against non-normality is achieved through trimmed means and Winsorized
  variances. A wrapper function eases the application of the test in common situations,
  such as performing omnibus tests on all effects and interactions, pairwise contrasts,
  and tetrad contrasts of two-way interactions. The package is demonstrated in several
  problems including unbalanced univariate and multivariate designs.
