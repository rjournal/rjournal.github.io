title: Implementing Persistent O(1) Stacks and Queues in R
abstract: True to their functional roots, most R functions are side-effect-free, and
  users expect datatypes to be persistent. However, these semantics complicate the
  creation of efficient and dynamic data structures. Here, we describe the implementation
  of stack and queue data structures satisfying these conditions in R, available in
  the CRAN package rstackdeque. Guided by important work in purely functional languages,
  we look at both partiallyand fully-persistent versions of queues, comparing their
  performance characteristics. Finally, we illustrate the usefulness of such dynamic
  structures with examples of generating and solving mazes.
