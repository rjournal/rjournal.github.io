title: 'KSPM: A Package For Kernel Semi-Parametric Models'
abstract: Kernel semi-parametric models and their equivalence with linear mixed models
  provide analysts with the flexibility of machine learning methods and a foundation
  for inference and tests of hypothesis. These models are not impacted by the number
  of predictor variables, since the kernel trick transforms them to a kernel matrix
  whose size only depends on the number of subjects. Hence, methods based on this
  model are appealing and numerous, however only a few R programs are available and
  none includes a complete set of features. Here, we present the *KSPM* package to
  fit the kernel semi-parametric model and its extensions in a unified framework.
  *KSPM* allows multiple kernels and unlimited interactions in the same model. It
  also includes predictions, statistical tests, variable selection procedure and graphical
  tools for diagnostics and interpretation of variable effects. Currently *KSPM* is
  implemented for continuous dependent variables but could be extended to binary or
  survival outcomes.

# Introduction

In the last decades, the popularity and accessibility of machine
learning has increased as a result of both the availability of big data
and technical progress in computer science. The flexibility of machine
learning methods enables avoidance of assumptions about functional
relationships, such as strong linear or additive hypotheses, that are
often involved in classical statistical models. However, this
flexibility and adaptability also limits the capacity to interpret
results or make inference. When understanding and inference are
required, simpler statistical models are often preferred, as they are
easy to understand and implement. Methods from the machine learning
field might better model complex relationships, and yet would be more
attractive if the results could be made interpretable. With this goal in
mind, [@liu2007semiparametric] clearly demonstrated the
under-appreciated equivalence between a machine learning tool and a
classical statistic model through the link between kernel
semi-parametric models -- developed first in the machine learning field
-- and more classical linear mixed models. This equivalence allows
analysts to take advantage of knowledge advances in both the machine
learning domain and the traditional statistical inference domain,
including hypotheses testing, when using kernel semi-parametric models
(Table [1](#table:MLvsStat)).

statistical models and features from machine learning models.
:::

The kernel semi-parametric model assumes that the outcome is related to
the set of variables through an unknown smooth function, which is simply
approximated by computing the similarity matrix between subjects
according to the set of variables and a chosen kernel function (i.e.,
the kernel trick). Matrix size depends only on the number of subjects,
making kernel models particularly suited to datasets where the number of
features is very large ($p >>n$). The equivalence between kernel
semi-parametric models and linear mixed models motivates a score test,
which is simple to implement, for the simultaneous effect of all
variables on the outcome.

Methods based on the kernel semi-parametric model and its extensions are
appealing and numerous, but only a few programs are available, and none
includes a complete set of the features that correspond to recent
developments. Table [2](#table:packages) gives some examples of existing
R packages according to their features of interest.

:::

Several packages in Table [2](#table:packages) were developed in the
genetics field where interest often lies in testing the contribution of
a group of variables (variants) simultaneously, notably through the
sequence kernel association test (SKAT) for single nucleotide
polymorphisms [@wu2011rare; @chen2016small]. Extensions from single to
multiple kernel model were motivated by (i) interaction
tests [@li2012gene; @wang2017set; @ge2015kernel; @marceau2015fast] and
(ii) estimating the conditional effect of one set of variables after
adjusting for another set of variables, or after adjusting for
population structure [@oualkacha2013adjusted]. The latter goal may be
achieved easily using the `lmekin()` function from the *coxme* package
under mixed model theory where kinship matrix corresponds to the kernel
matrix measuring similarity between subjects, and defines the covariance
matrix of the random effect term.

In the machine learning field, packages like *e1071* have been developed
to perform accurate predictions and they focus on a single kernel
function. Traditionally, model interpretation has remained an
outstanding challenge of the machine learning field. However it has been
recently demonstrated that the kernel semi-parametric models can be used
to interpret effects of variables on the outcome through a graphical
tool based on derivatives [@hainmueller2013kernel] and this is
implemented in the *KRLS* package. When the kernel function and the
corresponding approximated smooth function are differentiable with
respect to the variable of interest, pointwise derivatives capture the
effect of this variable on the outcome.

Since researchers may be interested in all of these features, we have
consolidated them in the R package *KSPM*. The package and a vignette
including detailed examples are available from the comprehensive R
archive network (CRAN) at https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=KSPM. Our
package, currently designed for continuous outcomes and normal errors,
fits kernel semi-parametric models and their extensions in a unified
framework incorporating all the previously described model fitting
features and tests. It allows multiple kernels and unlimited
interactions in the same model. Although most popular kernel functions
are available in the package, the user also has the option of designing
and using his/her own kernel functions. Furthermore, whenever interest
lies in prediction or making inference from the model, diagnostic
assessments of the model may be performed through graphical tools to
detect data points with large residuals or high leverage that may
greatly influence the results. Finally, we have also included a variable
selection procedure based on Akaike's and Bayesian information criteria
(AIC and BIC). These last two options are not included in other software
packages.

The *KSPM* package is a new tool for semi-parametric regression. It is
not competing with other R packages for semi- or non-parametric
regression models since either our methods or our objectives are
different. Indeed, the estimation method involved in *KSPM* is based on
regularized least squares in the kernel Hilbert space and should not be
confused with local kernel smoothing based on Nadaraya-Watson estimator
([*np*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=np) package, [@npPackage]).
Similarly, *KSPM* is also different from other smoothing methods
connecting regression segments through knots among which we may cite
splines ([*mgcv*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=mgcv) package,
[@mgcvPackage]).

However, since the kernel semi-parametric model is equivalent to a
linear mixed effect model, our package could be compared to
[*lme4*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=lme4) [@lme4package] or
[*nlme*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=nlme) [@nlmePackage]
packages for linear mixed effect models. Although it is possible to
obtain similar inference from any variables involved in a linear part of
each model, and to obtain similar predictions from both overall models,
loss function maximization are different. Moreover, *KSPM* has the
advantage of being easier-to-use as the user does not need to compute
kernel matrix nor matrix of interactions and provides interpretations
for variable effects that cannot be obtained with traditional packages.

# Kernel semi-parametric models

## Single kernel semi-parametric model {#sec:models-notations-skspm}

Let $Y = (Y_1, ..., Y_n)^\top$ be a $n \times 1$ vector of continuous
outcomes where $Y_i$ is the value for subject $i$ ($i = 1, ..., n)$, and
$X$ and $Z$ are $n \times p$ and $n \times q$ matrices of predictors,
such that $Y$ depends on $X$ and
$Z = (\mathbf{z_{.1}} , ..., \mathbf{z_{.q}})$ as follows:
$$\label{eq:kspm}
Y = X\beta + h(Z) + e   (\#eq:kspm)$$
where $\beta$ is a $p \times 1$ vector of regression coefficients for
the linear parametric part, $h(.)$ is an unknown smooth function and $e$
is an $n \times 1$ vector of independent and homoscedastic errors such
as $e_i \sim \mathcal{N}(0, \sigma^2)$. Throughout this article,
$X\beta$ will be referred to as the linear part of the model and we
assume that $X$ contains an intercept. $h(Z)$ will be referred to as the
kernel part. The function $h(.)$ need not be explicitly specified but it
is assumed to lie in $\mathcal{H}_k$, the function space generated by a
kernel function $k(.,.)$ which is, by definition, symmetric and positive
definite. We note that $K$, the $n \times n$ Gram matrix of $k(.,.)$
such that $K_{ij} = k(\mathbf{z_{i.}}, \mathbf{z_{j.}})$, represents the
similarity between subjects $i$ and $j$ according to $Z$. Of note, in
the estimation process, $h(.)$ will be expressed as a linear combination
of $k(.,.)$ (see Equation (\@ref(eq:representer))). See \"Fitting the
kernel semi-parametric model with `kspm`\" for straightforward coding.

## The multiple kernel semi-parametric model {#sec:models-notations-mkspm}

Now suppose there are $L$ matrices $Z_1, ..., Z_L$ of dimension
$n \times q_1$, \..., $n \times q_L$ respectively. Keeping a similar
notation, $Y$ can be assumed to depend on $X$ and $Z_1$, \..., $Z_L$ as
follows:
$$\label{eq:mkspm}
Y = X\beta + \sum\limits_{\ell = 1}^L h_{\ell}(Z_{\ell}) + e   (\#eq:mkspm)$$
where $\forall \ell \in \left\lbrace 1, ..., L \right\rbrace$,
$h_{\ell}$ is an unknown smooth function from $\mathcal{H}_{k_{\ell}}$,
the function space generated by a kernel function $k_{\ell}(.,.)$ whose
Gram matrix is noted $K_{\ell}$. We assume $\forall \ell \neq m$,
$h_{\ell}(Z_{\ell}) \neq h_{m}(Z_{m})$ either because
$Z_{\ell} \neq Z_{m}$ or $k_{\ell}(.,.) \neq k_{m}(.,.)$ or both. Note
that when $L = 1$, the model corresponds to Equation (\@ref(eq:kspm)).

Suppose there is an interaction between two sets of variables
represented by $Z_1$ and $Z_2$, $n \times q_1$ and $n \times q_2$
matrices, and $Y$ depends on $X$, $Z_1$ and $Z_2$ as follows:
$$\label{eq:ikspm}
Y = X\beta + h_1(Z_1) + h_2(Z_2) + h_{12}(Z_1, Z_2) + e   (\#eq:ikspm)$$
where $h_1(.)$, $h_2(.)$ and $h_{12}(.,.)$ are unknown smooth functions
from $\mathcal{H}_{k_1}$, $\mathcal{H}_{k_2}$ and $\mathcal{H}_{k_{12}}$
respectively. The $h_{12}(.,.)$ function represents the interaction term
if its associated kernel function $k_{12}(.,.)$ is defined as the
product of kernel functions $k_1(.,.)$ and $k_2(.,.)$ as follows:
$$\label{eq:inter}
k_{12}\left((Z_1, Z_2)_i, (Z_1, Z_2)_j\right) = k_1(\mathbf{z_{1i.}}, \mathbf{z_{1j.}}) \times k_2(\mathbf{z_{2i.}}, \mathbf{z_{2j.}})   (\#eq:inter)$$
such that $K_{12} = K_1 \odot K_2$ where $\odot$ is the Hadamard
product [@ge2015kernel]. Model (\@ref(eq:ikspm)) is a particular case of
the multiple kernel semi-parametric model (\@ref(eq:mkspm)) with $L=3$,
$Z_3 = (Z_1, Z_2)$, $q_3 = q_1 + q_2$ and $h_{3}$ = $h_{12}$. Of notes,
in *KSPM*, different kernel choices can be made for $k_1(.,.)$ and
$k_2(.,.)$. Obviously, this 2-way interaction model could be generalized
to higher order interaction terms in a similar manner.

## Link with linear mixed models {#sec:models-notations-lme}

As shown by [@liu2007semiparametric], model (\@ref(eq:mkspm)) is
equivalent, without additional conditions, to the following linear mixed
model:
$$\label{eq:lmm}
Y = X\beta + \sum\limits_{\ell = 1}^L h_{\ell} + e   (\#eq:lmm)$$
where $\forall \ell \in \left\lbrace 1,...,L\right\rbrace$,
$h_{\ell} \sim \mathcal{N}(0, \tau_{\ell} K_{\ell})$ with $K_{\ell}$ is
a matrix of similarity between subjects as defined in
model (\@ref(eq:mkspm)). Throughout the paper, we denote the variance
parameters as $\theta = (\tau_{1}, ..., \tau_L, \sigma^2)$ and
$\Sigma_{\theta} = \sum\limits_{\ell = 1}^L \tau_{\ell}K_{\ell} + \sigma^2 I$,
the variance-covariance matrix of $Y$, where $I$ is the $n \times n$
identity matrix.

## Estimation of parameters {#sec:models-estimation}

The parameter estimates can be obtained either by maximizing the
penalized log-likelihood associated with the kernel semi-parametric
model (\@ref(eq:mkspm)), or the log-likelihood derived from the
corresponding linear mixed model (\@ref(eq:lmm))
[@liu2007semiparametric]. Even though the latter option may be
computationally less time-consuming, we implemented the *KSPM* package
using a penalized log-likelihood associated with the kernel
semi-parametric model, because this method leads to an estimation of $h$
useful for prediction, and also leads to suitable approaches for
interpretation through kernel derivatives. Estimation of parameters is
obtained by maximizing the penalized log-likelihood function:
$$\label{eq:pll}
l(\beta, h) = -\frac{1}{2}\sum\limits_{i = 1}^n \left(Y_i - X_i^\top\beta - \sum\limits_{\ell = 1}^L h_{\ell}(Z_{\ell i}) \right)^2 - \frac{1}{2}\sum\limits_{\ell = 1}^L \lambda_{\ell} \parallel h_{\ell}\parallel_{\mathcal{H}_{k_{\ell}}}^2   (\#eq:pll)$$
where $\lambda_1$, \..., $\lambda_L$ are tuning parameters associated
with each smooth function $h_1(.)$, \..., $h_L(.)$ and
$\parallel .\parallel^2_{\mathcal{H}_{k_{\ell}}}$ defines the inner
product on $\mathcal{H}_{k_{\ell}}$ space. According to the Representer
theorem [@kimeldorf1971some], the functions $h_1$, \..., $h_L$
satisfying Equation (\@ref(eq:pll)) can be expressed as:
$$\label{eq:representer}
\forall \ell \in \left\lbrace 1,...,L \right\rbrace, \quad h_{\ell}(.) = \sum\limits_{i=1}^n \alpha_{\ell i} k(., Z_{\ell i})   (\#eq:representer)$$
where $\forall \ell \in \left\lbrace 1,...,L \right\rbrace$,
$\alpha_{\ell} = (\alpha_{\ell 1}, ..., \alpha_{\ell n})^\top$ is a
$n \times 1$ vector of unknown parameters. Estimating the kernel
semi-parametric model parameters consists in estimating
$\alpha_1, ..., \alpha_L$ and $\beta$. Then, estimators of $h_1(.)$,
\..., $h_L(.)$ are deduced from $\hat{\alpha}_1, ..., \hat{\alpha}_L$.

In *KSPM*, we estimate penalization parameters by minimizing the mean
sum of squares of the leave-one-out errors (LOOE). An advantage of LOOE
compared to other cross-validation methods is that we do not need to
recompute new model(s), because its value may be derived directly from
the primary model parameters:
$$\label{eq:looe}
\forall i \in \left\lbrace 1, ..., n\right\rbrace, \qquad \text{LOOE}_i(\lambda_1, ...,\lambda_L) =  \frac{Y_i - \hat{Y}_i}{1-H_{ii}}   (\#eq:looe)$$
where $H_{ii}$ is the $i^{th}$ diagonal element of the Hat matrix $H$
such as $\hat{Y} = H Y$.

Penalization parameters and tuning parameters, if applicable, are
estimated simultaneously during the optimization algorithm, by
minimizing the LOOE. If only one parameter needs to be estimated, the
convexity of the function to be minimized makes the problem easier and
the convergence faster. In that case, *KSPM* uses the standard
`optimize()` function from the basic R package, based on the golden
section search algorithm [@brent2013algorithms]. When several
hyperparameters need to be estimated, the resulting function to be
minimized may not be convex. Hence, more complex optimization algorithms
should be envisaged, and *KSPM* uses the `DEoptim()` function from the
[*DEoptim*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=DEoptim)
package [@DEoptimPackage] based on the differential evolution algorithm
[@mullen2009deoptim]. Given the random nature of the algorithm, it would
be safe to apply the algorithm several times to ensure convergence
toward the global minimum.

## Tests of hypotheses in *KSPM* {#sec:models-tests}

For either a single kernel or a multiple kernel semi-parametric model, a
standard test of interest is $H_0: h_{\ell}(.) = 0$, i.e., there is no
effect, singly or jointly, of a set of variables on the outcome.
Following [@liu2007semiparametric], this test is equivalent to
$H_0: \tau_{\ell} = 0$, a test of the variance component in the linear
mixed model (\@ref(eq:lmm)) using the REML-based score test. The
corresponding test statistic $Q_{\ell}$ follows a mixture of independent
chi-square distributions with one degree of freedom
[@zhang2003hypothesis]. The *KSPM* package uses exact distribution of
$Q_{\ell}$ in single kernel model but in multiple kernel model, we use
Davies' method to approximate this distribution
[@davies1980distribution]. Based on similar methodology, *KSPM* also
provides the global test for multiple kernel semi-parametric models
$H_0: h_1(.) = ... = h_L(.) = 0$ i.e., $H_0: \tau_1 = ... = \tau_L = 0$.

## Interpretation of variable effects {#sec:models-interpret}

A kernel represents similarity between subjects through combining a set
of variables in a possibly complex way, that may include their possible
interactions. Hence the general effect of a kernel on an outcome is hard
to see and difficult to interpret. Nevertheless, the marginal effect of
each variable in the kernel may be illustrated using a partial
derivative function [@hainmueller2013kernel]. Indeed, the derivative
measures how the change in a variable of interest impacts the outcome in
an intuitively understandable way. When a variable's effect is linear,
the interpretation is straightforward since the derivative corresponds
to standard slope ($\beta$) coefficients. In kernel semi-parametric
models, we are simultaneously modeling a set of variables. Therefore,
when exploring the effect of any one variable of interest, the other
variables in the kernel must be taken into account. Thus, plotting
pointwise derivatives of the prediction for each subject against the
value of the variable of interest may help in interpreting the effect of
this variable on the outcome. Although a variable-level summary
statistic may be obtained by averaging the pointwise derivatives across
subjects [@hainmueller2013kernel], we did not implement this option in
*KSPM* because the average can mask relevant variability. For example,
when positive and negative derivatives occur for the same variable, the
average may be zero.

## The choice of kernel functions {#sec:models-functions}

In any kernel semi-parametric model, the smooth unknown function
$h_{\ell}(.)$ is approximated using basis functions from
$\mathcal{H}_{k_{\ell}}$. Since the inner product of the basis functions
corresponds to the kernel function $k_{\ell}(.,.)$, the choice of the
kernel determines the function space used to approximate $h_{\ell}(.)$.
The *KSPM* package includes the most popular kernel functions, described
below. The linear kernel function $k(Z_i, Z_j) = Z_i^\top Z_j$ assumes
that variables have a linear effect on outcome. It generates a linear
function space so that the kernel semi-parametric model leads to a
penalized multiple linear model using an $L^2$ norm (equivalent to a
ridge regression). The polynomial kernel function
$k(Z_i, Z_j) = (\rho \, Z_i^\top Z_j + \gamma)^d$ assumes that
$d^{th}$-order products of the variables have a linear effect on the
outcome, and is equivalent to a $d^{th}$-order interaction model. The
Gaussian kernel function
$k(Z_i, Z_j) = exp(-\parallel Z_i - Z_j\parallel^2 / \rho)$ generates
the infinite function space of radial basis functions. The sigmoid
kernel function $k(Z_i, Z_j) = tanh(\rho \, Z_i^\top Z_j + \gamma)$ and
the inverse quadratic kernel
$k(Z_i, Z_j) = (\parallel Z_i - Z_j\parallel^2 + \gamma)^{-1/2}$ are
also often cited in the literature. Finally, we propose also the
equality kernel
$k(Z_i, Z_j) = 1 \; \text{if} \; Z_i = Z_j \; \text{and}  \; 0 \; \text{otherwise}$.
Of note, users can define their own kernel function in *KSPM* by
providing the corresponding kernel matrix. Some kernel functions, such
as the linear or polynomial kernels, make assumptions about the shape of
the effect of the variables on the continuous outcome, whereas other
kernels like the gaussian may, in theory, handle all types of effects,
regardless of their complexity. Indeed, in contrast to the linear and
polynomial kernels, the gaussian kernel function captures a kernel space
of infinite size leading to higher flexibility for approximation of
$h(.)$. If true effects are linear, the linear kernel and gaussian
kernel should converge toward similar results. However, in practice, if
sample size is low or noise is large, the gaussian kernel will tend to
retain a sinusoidal shape to the fit even when the truth is linear.

Kernel functions often involve tuning parameters; above, the parameters
$\rho$ and $\gamma$ were used to indicate these kernel specific
parameters. In practice, these tuning parameters are usually chosen by
the user. However, if user does not provide a value for these
parameters, the *KSPM* package estimates them at the same time as the
penalization parameter(s), by minimizing the mean sum of squares of
LOOE. The choice of tuning parameters may strongly impact the results
and modify the smoothness of the $\hat{h}(.)$ function leading to
overfitting or underfitting. For example, with a $\rho$ value that is
too large, the Gaussian kernel tends to lose its non-linear properties,
whereas with $\rho$ too small, it is very sensitive to noise.

In general, the choice of tuning parameters may strongly impact the
results With that in mind, sensitivity analyses may include a comparison
of results obtained with different values for these parameters. Also,
comparing models based on information criteria such as AIC and BIC may
help to choose the kernel function and its tuning parameter(s).

# Package presentation {#sec:package}

The *KSPM* package provides an R interface to perform kernel
semi-parametric models and is available from the comprehensive R archive
network (CRAN) at https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=KSPM. The package
is called through the main function `kspm()` taking data and model
hyperparameters as inputs, fitting the model, and returning a model fit
object of class `"kspm"`.

## Fitting the kernel semi parametric model with `kspm` {#sec:package-kspm}

The main function of the package, `kspm()`, can fit the single or
multiple kernel semi-parametric models described in the earlier, as
detailed below:

`kspm(response, linear, kernel, data, ...)`

The argument `response` indicates a continuous outcome variable. It can
be specified as a string corresponding to the column name associated
with the response in the dataset provided in the `data` argument, as a
vector of length $n$, or as a $n \times 1$ matrix containing the
continuous values of the outcomes. Of note, `kspm` does not deal with
multivariate outcomes, and if an $n \times r$ ($>1$) matrix is provided,
only the first column is used. Argument `linear` specifies the linear
part of the model and could be either a formula, a vector of length $n$
if only one variable is included in the linear part, or an $n \times p$
design matrix containing the $p$ variables included in the linear part.
By default, an intercept is added. To remove the intercept term, the
user should use the formula specification and add the term `-1`, as
usual. `kernel` specifies the kernel part of the model. Its argument
should be a formula of `Kernel` object(s), described below. For a
multiple kernel semi-parametric model, `Kernel` objects are separated by
the usual signs `"+"`, `"*"` and `":"` to specify addition and
interaction between kernels.

The `Kernel` object regroups all information about a kernel including
the choice of kernel function and its parameters. It is specified using
the `Kernel` function as follows:

`Kernel(x, kernel.function, scale, rho, gamma, d)`

Argument `x` represents either the variables included in the kernel part
of the model, or a kernel Gram matrix. In the latter case, the user
should specify `kernel.function = "gram.matrix"` and all other arguments
are not used. When `x` represents the variables included in the kernel
part, it may be specified as a formula, a vector, or a matrix, and
`kernel.function` indicates which kernel function should be used (e.g.,
`"gaussian"`, `"polynomial"`, \...). `scale` is a boolean indicating if
variables should be scaled before computing the gram matrix. The need
for other arguments depends on the choice of kernel function: `rho` and
`gamma` are tuning parameters and `d` is the highest order in a
polynomial kernel function; these parameters correspond to the $\rho$,
$\gamma$ and $d$ introduced earlier. It is worth noting that in a
multiple kernel model, *KSPM* allows kernel objects to follow different
formats.

Different options were considered for the interface with respect to
specification of the linear and kernel parts of the model. We decided to
use an interface with separate formulae for the two parts. This
structure makes it straightforward to manage variables coming from
different sources or data structures within the package. For example,
genetic data or high dimensional genomic data are often provided in a
matrix format, whereas other variables and phenotypes are saved in
vectors or data frames with meaningful variable names. This diversity of
data source and format cannot be handled by a unique formula. If data
elements are assembled from different sources, they should include the
same individuals or observations ($i=1,..,n$), with identical ordering;
if not, `kspm` will return an error. It is worth noting that the *KSPM*
package does tolerate observations containing missing values, although
these observations will be removed prior to model fitting.

The function `kspm` returns an object of class `"kspm"` with `summary()`
and `plot()` commands available, the first giving estimates and
$p$-values and the second displaying diagnostic plots.

## Methods applicable to objects of the class `"kspm"` {#package-kspm-class}

An object of class `"kspm"` results from a kernel semi-parametric model
fit. It contains obviously estimated coefficients, fitted values and
residuals, but also information about kernels such as $n \times n$
kernel matrices, hyperparameters, penalization parameters.

The `"kspm"` object can be summarized or viewed using commands and
methods very similar to those implemented in `"lm"` or `"glm"`.

``` r

[11] predict     print           residuals  rstandard       sigma 
[16] summary     variable.names
see '?methods' for accessing help and source code
```

## Predictions {#sec:package-predict}

A `predict()` command has been implemented for the class `"kspm"`.

`predict.kspm(object, newdata.linear, newdata.kernel, interval, level)`

where `object` refers to a `"kspm"` object. If a new dataset is not
specified, `predict.kspm` will return the fitted values from the
original data. If `predict.kspm` is applied to a new dataset, all
variables used in the original model should be provided in the
`newdata.linear` and `newdata.kernel` arguments. `newdata.linear` should
be a data frame, a vector or design matrix of variables used in the
linear part. `newdata.kernel` is a list containing data frames, vectors
and/or design matrices for each kernel. Formats depend on the ones
previously used in model specification as shown in
Table [3](#tab:predic-newdata). For simplicity, users may follow the
list returned by the `info.kspm()` function.

::: {#tab:predic-newdata}
  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  design matrix $n \times q$   a matrix $n^{\star} \times q$

  kernel matrix $n \times n$   a matrix $n^{\star} \times n$ where cell $i,j$ represents the similarity between new subject $i$ and $j^{th}$ subject included in the model.
  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  : Table 3: How new data should be specified in `predict.kspm`,
  depending on original model specifications for $n^{\star}$ new
  subjects. The first column refers to how the kernel is specified in
  the current model. The second column refers to how the new data should
  be specified in the `predict.kspm` function.
:::

In `predict.kspm`, `interval` can be either `"none"`, `"confidence"`, or
`"prediction"` according to whether the user wants a confidence or
prediction interval. The level of confidence/prediction interval is
specified using the `level` argument. By default, `level = 0.95` is
used.

## Variable selection procedures for the single kernel semi-parametric model {#sec:stepKSPM}

A variable selection procedure algorithm has been implemented for the
class `"kspm"`. It is similar to the `step()` command existing for other
regression packages.

`stepKSPM(object, linear.lower, linear.upper, kernel.lower, kernel.lower, k, direction)`

As before, `object` refers to a `"kspm"` object. However, in contrast to
the generality allowed for fitting a single kernel semi-parametric
model, here the `Kernel` object should not be specified with the Gram
matrix option. The arguments of `linear.lower`, `linear.upper`,
`kernel.lower` and `kernel.lower` are formulae corresponding to the
desired boundaries for the smallest and largest numbers of variables to
be included. As is standard in many R packages, all variables in the
`linear.lower` and `kernel.lower` formulae cannot be removed from the
model and variables that are not in the `linear.upper` and
`kernel.upper` formulae cannot be added to the model. The procedure to
select variables is based on AIC or BIC depending on the value of `k`.
If `k` is set to $2$, AIC is used, if `k` is set to $ln(n)$, BIC is used
instead. The `direction` argument may be `"forward"` for a forward
selection, `"backward"` for a backward selection and `"both"` for a
stepwise selection. Our package was implemented so that variable
selection for the linear part and the kernel part of the model may be
done simultaneously. However, it is also possible to perform the
variable selection procedure on each part separately by giving the
appropriate formula to `linear.lower`, `linear.upper`, `kernel.lower`
and `kernel.lower`.

Of note, as for the standard `stepAIC()` function, this procedure can
only be used on complete observations. Thus missing data should be
removed by the user prior to calling `stepKSPM()` so that the number of
observations is identical at each step.

## Graphical tools

The `plot()` method has been implemented for `"kspm"` and
`"derivatives.kspm"` objects. The former gives usual diagnostic plots
including residual distribution, leverage, Cook's distance,\... The
latter gives interpretation plot from pointwise derivatives.

# Example 1: the Movie ratings data

This first example illustrates the functions provided in *KSPM* included
the model fit, the diagnotic plot, the interpetation plot based on
pointwise derivatives, the test of interaction as well as the variable
selection procedure.

The conventional and social media movies (CSM) dataset is available on
the UCI machine learning repository
(https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/index.php) as well as in *KSPM* and is
fully described in [@ahmed2015using]. It contains data on 232 movies
from 2014 and 2015; the movies are described in term of conventional
features (sequel, budget in USD, gross income in USD, number of screens
in USA) as well as social media features (aggregate actor followers on
Twitter, number of views, likes, dislikes, comments of movie trailer on
Youtube, sentiment score) in the aim of predicting ratings. In all
subsequent analyses, we used only the 187 entries without missing data.

### Predict ratings using conventional features {#sec:illustrations-csm-model1}

In our first model, we assume a gaussian kernel function to fit the
joint effect of the conventional features on ratings. Here we do not
provide any value for the $\rho$ parameter. It will be estimated at the
same time as the penalization parameter by minimizing the LOOE. We also
do not provide a `linear` argument, meaning that only an intercept will
be included in the linear part of the model.

``` r
> csm.fit1 <- kspm(response = "Ratings", kernel = ~Kernel(~Gross + Budget +
+    Screens + Sequel, kernel.function = "gaussian"), data = csm)
> summary(csm.fit1)
```

``` r
Call:
kspm(response = "Ratings", kernel = ~Kernel(~Gross + Budget + 
    Screens + Sequel, kernel.function = "gaussian"), 
    data = csm)

Sample size:
n = 187

Residuals: 
    Min      Q1  Median      Q3     Max 
-3.0066 -0.4815  0.0109  0.5534  2.1228 

Coefficients (linear part): 
            Estimate Std. Error  t value     Pr(>|t|)
(Intercept) 6.297723   1.058707 5.948505 1.427565e-08

Score test for non-parametric kernel: 
         lambda      tau      p-value
Ker1 0.04804093 16.13793 5.625602e-06

Residual standard error: 0.88 on 175.82 effective degrees of freedom
Multiple R-squared: 0.2643, Adjusted R-squared: 0.2217
```

The summary output gives information about the sample size used in the
model, the residual distribution, the coefficient for the linear part
(similar to other regression R packages), and the penalization parameter
and score test associated with the kernel part. The kernel results
indicate that the conventional features are strongly associated with
ratings. In such a complex model, the number of free parameters -- i.e.,
the standard definition of the degrees of freedom of a model -- is
undefined, and we use instead the effective degrees of freedom of the
model, which is not necessarily a whole number. However, our definition
for effective degrees of freedom is similar to the one used in linear
regression models and depends on the trace of the hat matrix. The $\rho$
parameter may be extracted using the following code:

``` r
> csm.fit1$kernel.info$Ker1$rho
```

``` r
 par1
61.22
```

This value alone may not provide much information about linearity of the
kernel function. However interpretation is feasible when comparing
gaussian kernel functions with different $\rho$ parameter values, or
when comparing the gaussian and linear kernel functions.

The `plot()` command may be applied to the model to display diagnostic
plots. Figure [1](#fig:csm_Figure1) has been generated using the
following code:

``` r
> par(mfrow = c(2,2), mar = c(5, 5, 5, 2))
> plot(csm.fit1, which = c(1, 3, 5), cex.lab = 1.5, cex = 1.3, id.n = 7)
> hist(csm$Ratings, cex.lab = 1.5, main = "Histogram of Ratings", xlab = 
+    "Ratings")
```

![Figure 1: []{#fig:csm_Figure1 label="fig:csm_Figure1"} Diagnostic
plots of CSM data. Plots at the top left, top right and bottom left were
obtained with `plot.kspm`. They represent respectively residuals against
fitted values, the normal Q-Q plot of residuals and residuals against
leverage with the Cook's distance information. Plot at the bottom right
represents the distribution of ratings in the
database.](figure1.png){#fig:csm_Figure1 width="100%"
alt="graphic without alt text"}

Outlier points are annotated and we can see movie $134$ (*Jurassic
World*) has high leverage. Also of note, the lower tail of the residuals
distribution is not as expected for a Normal distribution. The histogram
of ratings shows that the deviation could be due to the left skewed
distribution of the response variable.

The derivative function may help to interpret the effect of each
variable individually on the outcome. Indeed, the sign of the
derivatives captures variational changes of the effect of the variable
on the outcome. To illustrate this feature, Figure [2](#fig:csm_Figure2)
displays the derivatives for Gross income, Budget and Screens. It has
been generated with the following code:

``` r
> par(mfrow = c(1,2), mar = c(5,5,5,2))
> plot(derivatives(csm.fit1), subset = "Gross", cex.lab = 1.5, cex = 1.3,
+    main = "Pointwise derivatives according to Gross Income")
> plot(derivatives(csm.fit1), subset = "Screens", col = csm$Sequel,
+    cex.lab = 1.5, cex = 1.3, pch = 16, main = "Pointwise derivatives
+    according to Number of Screens \n and Sequel")
> legend("topleft", fill = palette()[1:7], legend = 1:7, title = "Sequel", 
+    horiz = TRUE)
```

![Figure 2: []{#fig:csm_Figure2 label="fig:csm_Figure2"} Derivative
plots on CSM data obtained with `plot.derivatives`. Each point
corresponds to an observation. Plot on the left represents the pointwise
derivatives according to the Gross income variable. Plot on the right
represents the pointwise derivatives according to the Screens variable
and are colored according Sequel variable showing a probable interaction
between Screens and Sequel.](figure2.png){#fig:csm_Figure2 width="100%"
alt="graphic without alt text"}

By default, the X-axis label gives the name of the variable and, in
brackets, the kernel in which it is included. When only one kernel is
included in the kernel, it is named `Ker1`. Because genre and sequel
variables, even if they are numeric, refer to categorical variables, it
is possible to easily highlight some patterns of interaction between
these variables and the others. Derivatives according to Gross income
are mostly positive meaning that higher Gross income is associated with
higher ratings. However the slope of this effect decreases as the gross
income grows. It is difficult to interpret the derivatives for Gross
income higher than 2.5e+08 since this category includes only a few
movies. Based on the display in the right panel, whether a movie has
sequels seems to interact with the effect of the number of screens on
the ratings. Indeed when the movie is the first or second release
(Sequel = 1 or 2), the derivatives are always negative meaning that as
the number of screens on which the movie is released increases, the
ratings tend to decrease. However, this relationship seems to be
stronger for the first release than the second. No clear pattern can be
observed for subsequent sequels. It is difficult to know if this reveals
an absence of effect or whether there are simply too few movies past
sequel $2$ in these data.

To help in the choice of the kernel function, we may compare several
models by using information criteria. As an example, we fit a second
model assuming a polynomial kernel function with fixed tuning parameters
($\rho=1$, $\gamma=1$ and $d=2$). This model can be compared to the
previous one using information criteria such as the AIC or BIC. By
default the `extractAIC()` command gives the AIC.

``` r
> csm.fit2 <- kspm(response = "Ratings", kernel = ~Kernel(~Gross + Budget +
+    Screens + Sequel, kernel.function = "polynomial", rho = 1, gamma = 1,
+    d = 2), data = csm, level = 0)
> extractAIC(csm.fit1)
```

``` r
[1] 941.4521
```

``` r
> extractAIC(csm.fit2)
```

``` r
[1] 944.4618
```

Here, we concluded that gaussian kernel function fits our data better
than the polynomial kernel function, given the tuning parameters we
considered.

### Adding social media features to the model: a model with kernel interaction {#sec:illustrations-csm-model2}

Now, we assume a model with two kernel parts, one for conventional
features and one for social media features, as well as their
interaction. We propose to use the gaussian kernel function for each set
of features, although different kernels could be used. The
hyperparameters we chose are those obtained for each kernel separately.

``` r
> csm.fit3 <- kspm(response = "Ratings", linear = NULL, kernel = ~Kernel(~ 
+    Gross + Budget + Screens + Sequel, kernel.function = "gaussian",
+    rho = 61.22) * Kernel(~ Sentiment + Views + Likes + Dislikes + Comments + 
+    Aggregate.Followers, kernel.function = "gaussian", rho = 1.562652),
+    data = csm)
```

While the model is running, R returns a summary of the kernel part(s)
and interaction(s) included in the model.

``` r
------------------------------------------------------------------ 
The model includes the following kernels:  
Ker1 
Ker2 
Ker1:Ker2
------------------------------------------------------------------ 
Details: 
Ker1: ~Kernel(~Genre + Gross + Budget + Screens + Sequel,
kernel.function = "gaussian", rho = 55.5897)
Ker2: ~Kernel(~Sentiment + Views + Likes + Dislikes + Comments +
Aggregate.Followers, kernel.function = "gaussian", rho = 1.562652)
------------------------------------------------------------------
```

As defined by model (\@ref(eq:inter)), the `summary()` command will
return the $p$ value of tests $H_0: h_1(.) = 0$, $H_0: h_2(.) = 0$ and
$H_0: h_{12}(.) = 0$. By default all tests are performed. However, if
our interest lies only in the test of interaction, the `kernel.test`
option may be used to choose the test of interest and reduce the
computation time. If interest lies in the global test
$H_0: h_1(.) = h_2(.) = h_{12}(.) = 0$, the `global.test` option should
be set at `TRUE`.

``` r
> summary(csm.fit3, kernel.test = "Ker1:Ker2", global.test = TRUE)
```

``` r
Call:
kspm(response = "Ratings", linear = NULL, kernel = ~Kernel(~Gross + 
    Budget + Screens + Sequel, kernel.function = "gaussian", 
    rho = 61.22) * Kernel(~Sentiment + Views + Likes + Dislikes + 
    Comments + Aggregate.Followers, kernel.function = "gaussian", 
    rho = 1.562652), data = csm)

Residual standard error: 0.62 on 121.17 effective degrees of freedom
Multiple R-squared: 0.7452, Adjusted R-squared: 0.6089
```

Adding social media features to the model improved the predictions as
indicated by the adjusted $R^2$. However the smooth function associated
with the kernel interaction does not significantly differ from the null,
leading to the conclusion that there is no interaction effect between
conventional and social media features on the ratings.

Suppose now, we want to predict the ratings that will be attributed to
the three artificial movies described in tables [4](#table:csm-predict1)
and [5](#table:csm-predict2) below, according to the model `csm.fit3`.

```

The output of the `predict()` function gives the predicted values
(`fit`) and the lower (`lwr`) and upper (`upr`) bounds of prediction
intervals.

We may obtain the predictions for the original data directly from the
model or from the `predict()` function. With the latter, confidence
intervals may be additionally obtained.

``` r
> pred <- csm.fit3$fitted.value
> pred <- predict(csm.fit3, interval = "confidence")
> plot(csm$Ratings, pred$fit, xlim = c(2, 10), ylim = c(2, 10), 
+    xlab = "Observed ratings", ylab = "Predicted ratings", cex.lab = 1.3)
> abline(a = 0, b = 1, col = "red", lty = 2)
```

![Figure 3: []{#fig:csm_Figure3 label="fig:csm_Figure3"} Predicted
versus observed ratings in CSM dataset. Red dotted line represents a
perfect concordance between predictions and
observations.](figure3.png){#fig:csm_Figure3 width="100%"
alt="graphic without alt text"}

Figure ([3](#fig:csm_Figure3)) shows that for smaller values, the model
overestimates the outcome. This is again probably due to the left
skewness of the outcome distribution.

### An example of the variable selection procedure {#sec:illustrations-csm-model3}

Suppose we fit a single kernel semi-parametric model with a gaussian
kernel to adjust the social media features in the CSM data. The kernel
part contains the set of social media features. We want to select the
relevant variables to be included in the kernel. We therefore can
perform a stepwise variable selection procedure based on AIC, while
letting $\rho$ vary at each iteration. To do so, we first fit the full
model including all features.

``` r
> csm.fit4 <- kspm(response = "Ratings", kernel = ~Kernel(~ Sentiment + Views  
+    + Likes + Dislikes + Comments + Aggregate.Followers, kernel.function = 
+    "gaussian"), data = csm)
```

Then, we apply the `stepKSPM()` command on the full model as follows.

``` r
> stepKSPM(csm.fit4, kernel.lower = ~1, kernel.upper = ~ Sentiment + Views 
+    + Likes + Dislikes + Comments + Aggregate.Followers, direction = "both", 
+    k = 2, kernel.param = "change", data = csm)
```

At each iteration, R returns the current model, and the list of
variables that may be added or removed.

``` r
Start: AIC = 913.2
Linear part: ~ 1
Kernel part: ~ Sentiment + Views + Likes + Dislikes + Comments +
               Aggregate.Followers

                        Part      AIC
- Sentiment           kernel 910.8282
<none>                       913.1769
- Views               kernel 913.9753
- Likes               kernel 917.6532
- Comments            kernel 921.2163
- Aggregate.Followers kernel 925.4491
- Dislikes            kernel 969.4304


Step: AIC = 910.8
Linear part: ~ 1
Kernel part: ~ Views + Likes + Dislikes + Comments + Aggregate.Followers

                        Part      AIC
- Views               kernel 905.2908
<none>                       910.8282
+ Sentiment           kernel 913.1769
- Aggregate.Followers kernel 915.5481
- Likes               kernel 916.8125
- Comments            kernel 921.9627
- Dislikes            kernel 970.3804


Step: AIC = 905.3
Linear part: ~ 1
Kernel part: ~ Likes + Dislikes + Comments + Aggregate.Followers

                        Part      AIC
<none>                       905.2908
+ Views               kernel 910.8282
+ Sentiment           kernel 913.9753
- Aggregate.Followers kernel 916.0224
- Comments            kernel 917.8758
- Likes               kernel 925.0230
- Dislikes            kernel 968.2502
```

The final model includes the variables `Likes`, `Dislikes`, `Comments`
and `Aggregate.Followers`.

# Example 2: Consumption of energy data {#sec:illustrations-energy}

Our second example illustrates how *KSPM* may be efficient with complex
data as time series and show how the choice of tuning parameters impacts
the results.

The `energy` data is a set of data on energy consumption each hour on
Ouessant island (France) from September the 13th, 2015 to October the
4th, 2015, that were made publicly available by *Electricité de France*
at https://iles-ponant-edf-sei.opendatasoft.com. The data set also
contains corresponding meteorologic data such as temperature (Celsius
degrees), pressure (Pa) and humidity rate (g/m$^3$). These measures are
collected by *Meteo France* every 3 hours and are publicly available on
www.infoclimat.fr. We obtained hourly values by linear interpolation. In
total the data set contains 504 measurements.

``` r
> data("energy")
> head(energy)
```

``` r
     power       date        T        P       HR hour hour.num
1 526.1667 2015-09-13 12.43333 1007.933 81.66667  01h        1
2 495.0000 2015-09-13 12.36667 1007.167 82.33333  02h        2
3 446.1667 2015-09-13 12.30000 1006.400 83.00000  03h        3
4 365.8333 2015-09-13 12.30000 1005.833 82.66667  04h        4

6 352.3333 2015-09-13 12.30000 1004.700 82.00000  06h        6
```

These data demonstrate strong periodicity depending on time of day
(Figure [4](#fig:energy_Figure1)). Of note, if data had been collected
for a period longer than one year, a second periodicity would be visible
corresponding to seasons.

![Figure 4: []{#fig:energy_Figure1 label="fig:energy_Figure1"} Pattern
of energy consumption over the entire data set from Ouessant island
(Left) and on the three first days (Right). The power is observed each
hour and show a one day periodicity.](figure4.png){#fig:energy_Figure1
width="100%" alt="graphic without alt text"}

We will consider the 408 first measurements (17 days) as the training
set. The others 4 days will be used as a test set, where we want to
predict the energy consumption.

``` r
> energy_train_ <- energy[1:408, ]
> energy_test_ <- energy[409:504, ]
```

### Modeling {#sec:illustrations-energy-model1}

We fit a single kernel semi-parametric model to the training data. We
assume that energy depends linearly on temperature (`T`), and therefore
this variable is included in the linear part of the model. The other
meteorologic data, as well as hours in 24-hour numeric format, are
included in the kernel part of the model. We used a gaussian kernel and
we left the $\rho$ parameter free to be estimated by the model.

``` r
> energy.fit1 <- kspm(response = "power", linear = ~T, kernel = ~Kernel(~
+    hour.num + P + HR, kernel.function = "gaussian") , data = energy_train_)
> energy.fit1$kernel.info$Ker1$rho
```

``` r
     par1 
0.7028723 
```

### Impact of the $\rho$ parameter on derivatives and predictions {#sec:illustrations-energy-impact_rho}

We recomputed the model using other values for the $\rho$ parameter to
explore sensitivity of the results to this key kernel parameter. Values
were chosen tenfold larger and smaller than the estimated value of
$0.70$ in `energy.fit1`.

``` r
> energy.fit2 <- kspm(response = "power", linear = ~T, kernel = ~Kernel(~
+    hour.num + P + HR, kernel.function = "gaussian", rho = 7) , data =
+    energy_train_)
> energy.fit3 <- kspm(response = "power", linear = ~T, kernel = ~Kernel(~
+    hour.num +  P + HR, kernel.function = "gaussian", rho = 0.07) , data = 
+    energy_train_)
```

Figure [5](#fig:energy_Figure2) displays the predictions obtained on
both the training and test data sets, as well as the derivatives, as a
function of the hours variable, for the three models `energy.fit1`,
`energy.fit2` and `energy.fit3` that differ only on the value of the
tuning parameter $\rho$.

![Figure 5: []{#fig:energy_Figure2 label="fig:energy_Figure2"}
Predictions and derivatives obtained for different values of $\rho$ in
the energy dataset. Predictions on training data set are displayed with
confidence intervals, whereas predictions on test data set are displayed
with prediction intervals. The first row corresponds to the model
`energy.fit1` with estimated $\rho=0.7$. The second row corresponds to a
tenfold smaller $\rho=0.07$ (overfitting) and third row corresponds to a
tenfold larger $\rho=7$ (underfitting). The last column shows how the
choice of $\rho$ impacts the
derivatives.](figure5.png){#fig:energy_Figure2 width="100%"
alt="graphic without alt text"}

The first row of Figure [5](#fig:energy_Figure2) corresponds to the
model with the value of $\rho$ estimated by the model. Predictions fit
well for both the training and the test sets. The derivative graph shows
that between 6h00 and 12h00 and between 18h00 and 23h00 the derivatives
are positive. This result is coherent with the increase of energy
consumption during these times of the day
(Figure [4](#fig:energy_Figure1)-Right). Inversely between 0h00 and 6h00
and between 12h00 and 18h00, the energy consumption decreases as showed
by negative values of derivatives. One might have expected that
derivative values should be close between 0h00 and 23h00 but the peak
consumption observed at 23h00 everyday (Figure [4](#fig:energy_Figure1))
is probably associated with a sudden change in derivative values that is
difficult to smooth accurately.

This example shows how a gaussian kernel function may handle complex
functional data. However the choice of the $\rho$ parameter may
influence the results. A higher $\rho$ leads to a smoother approximation
of $h(.)$ and worsens the predictions. Indeed, a higher $\rho$ may
perfectly fit the training data set, but this corresponds to a case of
model overfitting, which results in biased predictions in the test set.
In contrast, a lower $\rho$ may lead to underfitting of training and
test data sets. The choice of the $\rho$ parameter also impacts the
derivatives; indeed a higher $\rho$ induces more noise among the
derivatives.

# Example 3: Gene-gene interaction {#sec:illustrations-gene}

This example shows how the interaction test may be applied to gene-gene
interaction using standard linear kernel and SNPs involved in genes.

We simulated a data of 300 subjects and 9 SNPs, 6 belonging to gene A
and 3 belonging to gene B, using the `glSim()` function into the
[*adegenet*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=adegenet) R
package [@adegenet]. SNPs are coded 0, 1 or 2 according to the number of
alleles of each type carried by the subject. A continuous outcome was
simulated as a linear combination of the interaction terms between the 6
SNPs of gene A and the three SNPs of gene B, where the weight
coefficients where randomly and uniformly chosen in the interval
$\left[-2;0\right]$. We added an intercept of 100 and a normally
distributed error of mean 0 and standard deviation 15. Code details are
available in Supplement S1.

Let `y` be the vector of continuous outcomes, `geneA` be the
$300 \times 6$ matrix of SNPs belonging to gene A and `geneB` be the
$300 \times 3$ matrix of SNPs belonging to gene B.

We test the interaction between the genes using the code below. Of note,
in this example, the data are specified using vector and design matrices
instead of using formulae and data frame as in previous examples.

``` r
> gene.fit <- kspm(response = y, kernel = ~ Kernel(geneA, kernel = "linear") 
+    * Kernel(geneB, kernel = "linear"))
> summary(gene.fit, kernel.test = "Ker1:Ker2")
```

``` r
Call:
kspm(response = y, kernel = ~Kernel(geneA, kernel = "linear") * 
    Kernel(geneB, kernel = "linear"))

Sample size:
n = 300

Residuals: 
     Min       Q1   Median       Q3      Max 
-34.1111  -8.7300  -1.1659   9.7299  38.6887 

Coefficients (linear part): 
            Estimate Std. Error  t value      Pr(>|t|)
(Intercept) 88.80183  0.8178659 108.5775 2.531469e-231

Score test for non-parametric kernel: 
            lambda       tau     p-value
Ker1:Ker2 199.4587 0.9862838 0.006646781

Residual standard error: 14.03 on 280.74 effective degrees of freedom
Multiple R-squared: 0.2387, Adjusted R-squared: 0.1892
```

The result suggests that genes A and B impact the continuous outcome y
through their interaction.

# Summary

This new *KSPM* package provides a flexible implementation of the kernel
semi-parametric model and its extensions in a unified framework, using
nomenclatures similar to other regression R packages. Thanks to the
kernel trick, such a model is useful when interest lies in prediction
and our `predict()` command makes this easy. Nevertheless, inference is
also possible through the confidence intervals and tests provided by the
package, such as through the `summary()` command. Moreover, we have
provided many options for model diagnostics (residuals, leverage, \...),
model interpretation (derivatives, \...) and model comparisons (AIC,
stepwise, \...).\
Model estimation for multiple kernel model is based on an iterative
estimation of regression parameters we develop and prove in Supplement
S2. Penalization and tuning parameter estimation involves `optimize()`
and `DEoptim()` functions. The both integrate C code ensuring a faster
convergence of the algorithms. However, the overall *KSPM* algorithm
includes inversion of $n \times n$ matrices, thereby resulting in slower
optimization as $n$ increases. It would improve *KSPM*'s performance to
combine matrix inversion code and optimization code in a single
efficient set of C code and we are considering this for a future
implementation. It is worth noting, however, that computation time is
not severely impacted by the number of predictors even if $n << q$.

In the *KRLS* package, [@hainmueller2013kernel] proposed a marginal test
for the individual effect of each variable included in the kernel. We
decided not to implement this test in our package since the marginal
effect may mask interesting but symmetric effects of a variable on the
continuous outcome. However, we have implemented a test of hypothesis
based on variance components to test the joint effect of a set of
variables on the continuous outcome. The distribution of this test
statistic follows a mixture of $\chi^2$ distributions that we
approximated using Davies' method [@davies1980distribution], available
through the
[*CompQuadForm*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=CompQuadForm)
package [@CQFpackage; @compQuadForm]. The distribution can also be
approximated by a scaled chi-squared distribution using Satterthwaite's
method where parameters are computed by moment matching.
[@schifano2012snp] compared the two approximation methods on the type-I
error rate in a single kernel semi-parametric model and showed that the
rate is inflated with Satterthwaite's method when the $\alpha$-level is
low, and therefore we recommend the Davies method. To assess global
testing of multiple kernels, we implemented a sum of the L single-kernel
test statistics as an overall test statistic. In general, the
computation of the $p$ value of this overall test involves the joint
distribution of ($Q_1$, \... $Q_L$). To derive analytical values for the
overall $p$ value, one can use techniques similar to those used
in [@sun2018], which relied on a copula-based model to approximate this
joint distribution. This last option is not yet implemented in *KSPM*.

For all our tests, the model has to be re-estimated under the null
hypothesis for the kernel of interest. If the resulting null model still
contains one or more kernel part(s), we made the choice to recompute
penalization parameter(s), since this choice ensures an optimized model
under the null hypothesis. However, we have also decided to leave the
kernel tuning parameters fixed when re-estimating under the null.
Indeed, a change in tuning parameters induces a change in the choice of
kernel functions - and thus in model assumptions - and hence, keeping
the tuning parameters fixed ensures comparability of model assumptions
under the null and the alternative hypotheses.

In our *KSPM* package, we have also included an algorithm for selection
of variables based on these information criteria. Backward, forward or
stepwise approaches can be chosen for single kernel semi-parametric
models. Although these concepts may be easily extended to the case of
multiple kernel models, such analyses require large computing times.
Parallelization of such a process may greatly increase the appeal of
this procedure. For now, we recommend investigating variables within a
single kernel before starting to fit multiple kernel models.

In summary, the *KSPM* package is a flexible comprehensible option for
studying the effects of groups of variables on a continuous outcome.
These tools may be extended to the case of binary or survival outcomes
in future work.

**SUPPLEMENT**

# Supplement S1

We simulated a $300 \times 9$ matrix representing the number of minor
allele (0, 1 or 2) of 300 subjects for 9 SNPs, 6 belonging to gene A and
3 belonging to gene B, using the `glSim()` function into the *adegenet*
R package.

``` r
> library(adegenet)
> set.seed(78)
> SNPdata <- as.matrix(glSim(n.ind = 300, n.snp.nonstruc = 9, n.snp.struc = 0, k = 1,
  LD = FALSE, ploidy = 2))
```

We may deduce two matrices, one with data belonging to gene A and one
with data belonging to gene B.

``` r
> geneA <- SNPdata[,1:6]
> geneB <- SNPdata[,7:9]
```

Then we computed the matrix of interactions between SNPs from gene A and
SNPs from geneB.

``` r
> SNPdataAB <- matrix(NA, nrow = 300, ncol = 6*3)
> k <- 1
> for (i in 1:6) {
    for (j in 1:3) {
      SNPdataAB[,k] <- SNPdataA[,i] * SNPdataB[,j]
      k <- k+1
    }
  }
```

A continuous outcome was simulated as a linear combination of the
interaction terms between the 6 SNPs of gene A and the three SNPs of
gene B, where the weight coefficients where randomly and uniformly
chosen in the interval $\left[-2;0\right]$ using the following code.

``` r
> beta <- as.matrix(runif(6*3,-2,0), nrow = 300)
> y <- 100 + SNPdataAB %*% beta + rnorm(n, 0, 15)
```

Of note, we added an intercept of 100 and a normally distributed error
of mean 0 and standard deviation 15.

# Supplement S2

Estimating the kernel semi-parametric model parameters consists in
estimating $\alpha_1, ..., \alpha_L$ and $\beta$. Then, estimators of
$h_1(.)$, \..., $h_L(.)$ are deduced from
$\hat{\alpha}_1, ..., \hat{\alpha}_L$. When there are multiple kernels,
estimation is iterative and so we proceed as follows. Partial
derivatives of $l(\beta, h)$ according to $\alpha_1, ..., \alpha_L$ and
$\beta$ lead to the following equations:

$$\label{eq:betaM}
\hat{\beta} =  \left\lbrace X^\top \left( I - \sum\limits_{\ell = 1}^L K_{\ell} G_{\ell}^{-1} M_{\ell} \right) X  \right\rbrace^{-1}  X^\top \left(I - \sum\limits_{\ell = 1}^L K_{\ell} G_{\ell}^{-1} M_{\ell}\right) Y   (\#eq:betaM)$$

$$\label{eq:alphaM}
\forall \ell \in \left\lbrace 1,..., L\right\rbrace, \quad \hat{\alpha}_{\ell} =  G_{\ell}^{-1} M_{\ell} \left(Y-X\hat{\beta}\right)   (\#eq:alphaM)$$
where $I$ is the $n \times n$ identity matrix and
$\forall \ell \in \left\lbrace 1, ..., L \right\rbrace$, $G_{\ell}$ and
$M_{\ell}$ are computed using an iterative process as described below:

-   Re-order elements $\alpha_{1...L}$, $K_{1...L}$ and
    $\lambda_{1...L}$ such that the last is the $\ell^{th}$ element
-   Note $\alpha_{(1)}$, \..., $\alpha_{(L)}$, $K_{(1)}$, \...,
    $K_{(L)}$ and $\lambda_{(1)}$, \..., $\lambda_{(L)}$ the re-ordered
    elements with $\alpha_{(L)} = \alpha_{\ell}$, $K_{(L)} = K_{\ell}$
    and $\lambda_{(L)} = \lambda_{\ell}$
-   Define iteratively $\mathcal{M}_{(0)...(L)}$ and
    $\mathcal{G}_{(1)...(L)}$ by $\mathcal{M}_{(0)} = I$ the
    $n \times n$ identity matrix and
    $\forall m \in \left\lbrace 1, ..., L \right\rbrace$:\
    $\mathcal{G}_{(m)} = \lambda_{(m)} I + \mathcal{M}_{(m-1)} K_{(m)}$\
    $\mathcal{M}_{(m)} = \left(I - \mathcal{M}_{(m-1)} K_{(m)} \mathcal{G}_{(m)}^{-1} \right) \mathcal{M}_{(m-1)}$
-   Compute $G_{\ell}$ and $M_{\ell}$ as:\
    $G_{\ell} = \mathcal{G}_{(L)}$\
    $M_{\ell} = \mathcal{M}_{(L-1)}$

Whereas the parameter estimation for single kernel model has been
largely demonstrated, the equations for computing multiple kernel
parameters were not theoretically developed yet. Above, we propose an
iterative way to estimate the parameters for all kernel models. Below,
we propose the proof for equations (\@ref(eq:betaM)) and
(\@ref(eq:alphaM)).\
**[Proof:]{.underline}**\
Partial derivatives of penalized likelihood (\@ref(eq:pll)) lead to
equations below:

$$\label{eq:derivll}
\left\lbrace \begin{aligned}
X^\top (Y - X\beta - \sum\limits_{\ell = 1}^L K_{\ell} \alpha_{\ell}) & =  0 \\
Y - X\beta - \sum\limits_{m = 1}^L K_{m} \alpha_{m} - \lambda_{\ell} \alpha_{\ell} & =  0 \quad \forall \ell \in \left\lbrace 1,...,L \right\rbrace
\end{aligned} \right.   (\#eq:derivll)$$

*Proposition 1:*
$\forall k \in \left\lbrace 1, ..., L-1\right\rbrace, \alpha_{(k)} = \mathcal{G}_{(k)}^{-1} \mathcal{M}_{(k - 1)} \left( Y - X\beta - \sum\limits_{m = k + 1}^L K_{(m)} \alpha_{(m)} \right)$\
*Proposition 2:* if proposition 1 is true until $k$, then
$$\sum\limits_{j = 1}^k K_{(m)}\alpha_{(m)} = (I - \mathcal{M}_{(k)})\left( Y - X\beta - \sum\limits_{m = k + 1}^L K_{(m)}\alpha_{(m)} \right)$$

*(Proofs of propositions 1 and 2 are given below.)*\
Now, suppose proposition 1 and proposition 2 are true.

$$\begin{aligned}
(\ref{eq:derivll}) \Rightarrow && Y - X\beta - \sum\limits_{m = 1}^L K_{(m)}\alpha_{(m)} - \lambda_{(L)}\alpha_{(L)} &= 0  \\
\Leftrightarrow &&  Y - X\beta - \sum\limits_{m = 1}^{L-1} K_{(m)}\alpha_{(m)} - K_{(L)}\alpha_{(L)} - \lambda_{(L)}\alpha_{(L)} &= 0 \\
\Leftrightarrow &&  Y - X\beta - (I - \mathcal{M}_{(L-1)})\left( Y - X\beta - K_{(L)}\alpha_{(L)} \right) - K_{(L)}\alpha_{(L)} - \lambda_{(L)}\alpha_{(L)}& = 0 \\ 
\Leftrightarrow && \left( \lambda_{(L)}I + \mathcal{M}_{(L-1)} K_{(L)} \right) \alpha_{(L)} - \mathcal{M}_{(L-1)} (Y - X\beta) &= 0    \\ 
\end{aligned}$$

Then,
$\alpha_{\ell} = \alpha_{(L)} = \mathcal{G}_{(L)}^{-1} \mathcal{M}_{(L - 1)} \left( Y - X\beta \right)$.
Let $G_{\ell}$ and $M_{\ell}$ the $n \times n$ matrix defined as
$G_{\ell} = \mathcal{G}_{(L)}$ and $M_{\ell} = \mathcal{M}_{(L - 1)}$,
thus $\alpha_{\ell} = G_{\ell}^{-1} M_{\ell} \left( Y - X\beta \right)$.
All this process is done for each
$\ell \in \left\lbrace 1, ..., L\right\rbrace$.\
Now, we can derive the estimate for $\beta$.\

$$\begin{aligned}
(\ref{eq:derivll}) \Rightarrow && X^\top \left( Y - X\beta - \sum\limits_{\ell = 1}^L K_{\ell}\alpha_{\ell} \right) & = 0 \\
\Leftrightarrow && X^\top\left( Y - X\beta - \sum\limits_{\ell = 1}^L K_{\ell}G_{\ell}^ {-1}M_{\ell} (Y - X\beta)\right) & = 0 \\
\Leftrightarrow && X^\top\left( I - \sum\limits_{\ell = 1}^L K_{\ell}G_{\ell}^ {-1}M_{\ell} \right) Y & = X^\top\left( I - \sum\limits_{\ell = 1}^L K_{\ell}G_{\ell}^ {-1}M_{\ell} \right) X\beta \\
\end{aligned}$$
 \
Thus
$\beta = \left\lbrace X^\top\left( I - \sum\limits_{\ell = 1}^L K_{\ell}G_{\ell}^ {-1}M_{\ell} \right) X \right\rbrace^{-1} X^\top\left( I - \sum\limits_{\ell = 1}^L K_{\ell}G_{\ell}^ {-1}M_{\ell} \right) Y$.\
*Proof of proposition 1:*\
$\bullet$ Proposition 1 is true for $k = 1$:\

$$\begin{aligned}
\text{(\ref{eq:derivll})} \Rightarrow             && Y - X\beta - \sum\limits_{m = 1}^L K_{(m)} \alpha_{(m)} - \lambda_{(1)} \alpha_{(1)} & = 0 \\
\Leftrightarrow && Y - X\beta - \sum\limits_{m = 2}^L K_{(m)} \alpha_{(m)} - K_{(1)} \alpha_{(1)} - \lambda_{(1)} \alpha_{(1)}  & =  0 \\
\Leftrightarrow && \mathcal{M}_{(0)} \left( Y - X\beta - \sum\limits_{m = 2}^L K_{(m)} \alpha_{(m)} \right) & =  \left( \lambda_{(1)} I + \mathcal{M}_{(0)} K_{(1)} \right) \alpha_{(1)} \\
\Leftrightarrow && \mathcal{G}_{(1)}^{-1} \mathcal{M}_{(0)} \left( Y - X\beta - \sum\limits_{m = 2}^L K_{(m)} \alpha_{(m)} \right) & =  \alpha_{(1)} \\
\end{aligned}$$

$\bullet$ If proposition 1 is true for $k$, then proposition 1 is true
for $k + 1$:\
According to proposition 2:\

$$\begin{aligned}
\sum\limits_{m = 1}^k K_{(m)} \alpha_{(m)} &=  (I - \mathcal{M}_{(k)}) \left(Y - X\beta - \sum\limits_{m = k + 1}^L K_{(m)}\alpha_{(m)} \right) \\
& = (I - \mathcal{M}_{(k)}) \left(Y - X\beta - \sum\limits_{m = k + 2}^L K_{(m)}\alpha_{(m)} \right) - (I - \mathcal{M}_{(k)}) K_{(k+1)} \alpha_{(k+1)}
\end{aligned}$$

$$\begin{aligned}
\text{(\ref{eq:derivll})} \Rightarrow  && Y - X\beta - \sum\limits_{m = 1}^L K_{(m)} \alpha_{(m)} - \lambda_{(k+1)} \alpha_{(k+1)}  & =  0 \\
\Leftrightarrow && Y - X\beta - \sum\limits_{m = 1}^k K_{(m)} \alpha_{(m)} - K_{(k+1)} \alpha_{(k+1)}  - \sum\limits_{m = k + 2}^L K_{(m)} \alpha_{(m)} -  \lambda_{(k+1)} \alpha_{(k+1)}   &=  0 \\
\Leftrightarrow && - \left( (I - \mathcal{M}_{(k)}) \left(Y - X\beta - \sum\limits_{m = k + 2}^L K_{(m)}\alpha_{(m)} \right) - (I - \mathcal{M}_{(k)}) K_{(k+1)} \alpha_{(k+1)} \right) & \\
&& + Y - X\beta - K_{(k+1)} \alpha_{(k+1)} - \sum\limits_{m = k + 2}^L K_{(m)} \alpha_{(m)} -  \lambda_{(k+1)} \alpha_{(k+1)}  & =  0 \\

\Leftrightarrow &&  \mathcal{G}_{(k+1)}^{-1}  \mathcal{M}_{(k)} \left(Y - X\beta - \sum\limits_{m = k + 2}^L K_{(m)} \alpha_{(m)} \right) &  =  \alpha_{(k+1)}   \\
\end{aligned}$$

*Proof of proposition 2:*\
$\bullet$ Proposition 2 is true for $k = 1$:\
Suppose
$\alpha_{(1)} = \mathcal{G}_{(1)}^{-1}\mathcal{M}_{(0)} \left( Y - X\beta - \sum\limits_{m = 2}^L K_{(m)}\alpha_{(m)} \right)$.

$$\begin{aligned}
\sum\limits_{m = 1}^1 K_{(m)} \alpha_{(m)} & =   K_{(1)}\alpha_{(1)} \\
  & =    K_{(1)} \mathcal{G}_{(1)}^{-1}\mathcal{M}_{(0)} \left( Y - X\beta - \sum\limits_{m = 2}^L K_{(m)}\alpha_{(m)} \right) \\
    & =   \left( I - \mathcal{M}_{(0)} + \mathcal{M}_{(0)} K_{(1)} G_1^{-1} \mathcal{M}_{(0)} \right) \left( Y - X\beta - \sum\limits_{m = 2}^L K_{(m)}\alpha_{(m)} \right)  \\
     & =   \left( I - (I - \mathcal{M}_{(0)} K_{(1)} G_1^{-1}) \mathcal{M}_{(0)}\right) \left( Y - X\beta - \sum\limits_{m = 2}^L K_{(m)}\alpha_{(m)} \right)  \\

$\bullet$ If proposition 2 is true for $k$, then proposition 2 is true
for $k + 1$:\
Suppose proposition 1 is true until $k+1$, then
$\forall j \in \left\lbrace 1, ..., k+1 \right\rbrace$,

$\alpha_{(j)} = \mathcal{G}_{(j)}^{-1}\mathcal{M}_{(j-1)} \left( Y - X\beta - \sum\limits_{m = j+1}^L K_{(m)}\alpha_{(m)} \right)$

$$\begin{aligned}
\sum\limits_{m = 1}^{k+1} K_{(m)} \alpha_{(m)} & =  \sum\limits_{m = 1}^{k} K_{(m)} \alpha_{(m)} + K_{(k+1)} \alpha_{(k+1)}\\
& =    (I - \mathcal{M}_{(k)}) \left(Y - X\beta - \sum\limits_{m = k + 1}^L K_{(m)}\alpha_{(m)} \right) + K_{(k+1)} \alpha_{(k+1)} \\
