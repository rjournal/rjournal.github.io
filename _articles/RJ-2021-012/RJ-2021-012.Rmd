title: 'KSPM: A Package For Kernel Semi-Parametric Models'
abstract: Kernel semi-parametric models and their equivalence with linear mixed models
  provide analysts with the flexibility of machine learning methods and a foundation
  for inference and tests of hypothesis. These models are not impacted by the number
  of predictor variables, since the kernel trick transforms them to a kernel matrix
  whose size only depends on the number of subjects. Hence, methods based on this
  model are appealing and numerous, however only a few R programs are available and
  none includes a complete set of features. Here, we present the KSPM package to fit
  the kernel semi-parametric model and its extensions in a unified framework. KSPM
  allows multiple kernels and unlimited interactions in the same model. It also includes
  predictions, statistical tests, variable selection procedure and graphical tools
  for diagnostics and interpretation of variable effects. Currently KSPM is implemented
  for continuous dependent variables but could be extended to binary or survival outcomes.
