title: 'easyROC: An Interactive Web-tool for ROC Curve Analysis Using R Language Environment'
abstract: ROC curve analysis is a fundamental tool for evaluating the performance
  of a marker in a number of research areas, e.g., biomedicine, bioinformatics, engineering
  etc., and is frequently used for discriminating cases from controls. There are a
  number of analysis tools which are used to guide researchers through their analysis.
  Some of these tools are commercial and provide basic methods for ROC curve analysis
  while others offer advanced analysis techniques and a command-based user interface,
  such as the R environment. The R environmentg includes comprehensive tools for ROC
  curve analysis; however, using a command-based interface might be challenging and
  time consuming when a quick evaluation is desired; especially for non-R users, physicians
  etc. Hence, a quick, comprehensive, free and easy-to-use analysis tool is required.
  For this purpose, we developed a user-friendly web tool based on the R language.
  This tool provides ROC statistics, graphical tools, optimal cutpoint calculation,
  comparison of several markers, and sample size estimation to support researchers
  in their decisions without writing R codes. easyROC can be used via any device with
  an internet connection independently of the operating system. The web interface
  of easyROC is constructed with the R package shiny. This tool is freely available
  through www.biosoft.hacettepe.edu.tr/easyROC.
