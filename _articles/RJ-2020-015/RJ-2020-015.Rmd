title: The R package NonProbEst for estimation in non-probability surveys
abstract: Different inference procedures are proposed in the literature to correct
  selection bias that might be introduced with non-random sampling mechanisms. The
  R package NonProbEst enables the estimation of parameters using some of these techniques
  to correct selection bias in non-probability surveys. The mean and the total of
  the target variable are estimated using Propensity Score Adjustment, calibration,
  statistical matching, model-based, model-assisted and model-calibratated techniques.
  Confidence intervals can also obtained for each method. Machine learning algorithms
  can be used for estimating the propensities or for predicting the unknown values
  of the target variable for the non-sampled units. Variance of a given estimator
  is performed by two different Leave-One-Out jackknife procedures. The functionality
  of the package is illustrated with example data sets.
