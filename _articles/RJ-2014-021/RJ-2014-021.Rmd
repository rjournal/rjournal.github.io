title: Automatic Conversion of Tables to LongForm Dataframes
abstract: TableToLongForm automatically converts hierarchical Tables intended for
  a human reader into a simple LongForm dataframe that is machine readable, making
  it easier to access and use the data for analysis. It does this by recognising positional
  cues present in the hierarchical Table (which would normally be interpreted visually
  by the human brain) to decompose, then reconstruct the data into a LongForm dataframe.
  The article motivates the benefit of such a conversion with an example Table, followed
  by a short user manual, which includes a comparison between the simple one argument
  call to TableToLongForm, with code for an equivalent manual conversion. The article
  then explores the types of Tables the package can convert by providing a gallery
  of all recognised patterns. It finishes with a discussion of available diagnostic
  methods and future work.
