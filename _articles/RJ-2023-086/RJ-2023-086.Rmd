title: 'glmmPen: High Dimensional Penalized Generalized Linear Mixed Models'
abstract: Generalized linear mixed models (GLMMs) are widely used in research for
  their ability to model correlated outcomes with non-Gaussian conditional distributions.
  The proper selection of fixed and random effects is a critical part of the modeling
  process since model misspecification may lead to significant bias. However, the
  joint selection of fixed and random effects has historically been limited to lower-dimensional
  GLMMs, largely due to the use of criterion-based model selection strategies. Here
  we present the R package glmmPen, one of the first to select fixed and random effects
  in higher dimension using a penalized GLMM modeling framework. Model parameters
  are estimated using a Monte Carlo Expectation Conditional Minimization (MCECM) algorithm,
  which leverages Stan and RcppArmadillo for increased computational efficiency. Our
  package supports the Binomial, Gaussian, and Poisson families and multiple penalty
  functions. In this manuscript we discuss the modeling procedure, estimation scheme,
  and software implementation through application to a pancreatic cancer subtyping
  study. Simulation results show our method has good performance in selecting both
  the fixed and random effects in high dimensional GLMMs.
