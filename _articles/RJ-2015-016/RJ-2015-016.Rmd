title: Estimability Tools for Package Developers
abstract: When a linear model is rank-deficient, then predictions based on that model
  become questionable because not all predictions are uniquely estimable. However,
  some of them are, and the estimability package provides tools that package developers
  can use to tell which is which. With the use of these tools, a model objectâ€™s predict
  method could return estimable predictions as-is while flagging non-estimable ones
  in some way, so that the user can know which predictions to believe. The estimability
  package also provides, as a demonstration, an estimability-enhanced epredict method
  to use in place of predict for models fitted using the stats package.
