title: 'PGEE: An R Package for Analysis of Longitudinal Data with High-Dimensional
  Covariates'
abstract: 'We introduce an R package PGEE that implements the penalized generalized
  estimating equations (GEE) procedure proposed by Wang et al. (2012) to analyze longitudinal
  data with a large number of covariates. The PGEE package includes three main functions:
  CVfit, PGEE, and MGEE. The CVfit function computes the cross-validated tuning parameter
  for penalized generalized estimating equations. The function PGEE performs simultaneous
  estimation and variable selection for longitudinal data with high-dimensional covariates;
  whereas the function MGEE fits unpenalized GEE to the data for comparison. The R
  package PGEE is illustrated using a yeast cell-cycle gene expression data set.'
