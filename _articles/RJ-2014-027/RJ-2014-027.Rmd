title: 'sgof: An R Package for Multiple Testing Problems'
abstract: In this paper we present a new R package called sgof for multiple hypothesis
  testing. The principal aim of this package is to implement SGoF-type multiple testing
  methods, known to be more powerful than the classical false discovery rate (FDR)
  and family-wise error rate (FWER) based methods in certain situations, particularly
  when the number of tests is large. This package includes Bi nomial and Conservative
  SGoF and the Bayesian and Beta-Binomial SGoF multiple testing procedures, which
  are adaptations of the original SGoF method to the Bayesian setting and to possibly
  correlated tests, respectively. The sgof package also implements the Benjamini-Hochberg
  and Benjamini-Yekutieli FDR controlling procedures. For each method the package
  provides (among other things) the number of rejected null hypotheses, estimation
  of the corresponding FDR, and the set of adjusted p values. Some automatic plots
  of interest are implemented too. Two real data examples are used to illustrate how
  sgof works.
