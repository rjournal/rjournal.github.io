title: fitzRoy - An R Package to Encourage Reproducible Sports Analysis
abstract: The importance of reproducibility, and the related issue of open access
  to data, has received a lot of recent attention. Momentum on these issues is gathering
  in the sports analytics community. While Australian Rules football (AFL) is the
  leading commercial sport in Australia, unlike popular international sports, there
  has been no mechanism for the public to access comprehensive statistics on players
  and teams. Expert commentary currently relies heavily on data that isn't made readily
  accessible and this produces an unnecessary barrier for the development of an inclusive
  sports analytics community. We present the R package fitzRoy to provide easy access
  to AFL statistics.
