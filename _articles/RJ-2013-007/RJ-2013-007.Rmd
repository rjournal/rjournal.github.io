title: Statistical Software from a Blind Person's Perspective
abstract: Blind people have experienced access issues to many software applications
  since the advent of the Windows operating system; statistical software has proven
  to follow the rule and not be an exception. The ability to use R within minutes
  of download with next to no adaptation has opened doors for accessible production
  of statistical analyses for this author (himself blind) and blind students around
  the world. This article shows how little is required to make R the most accessible
  statistical software available today. There is any number of ramifications that
  this opportunity creates for blind students, especially in terms of their future
  research and employment prospects. There is potential for making R even better for
  blind users. The extensibility of R makes this possible through added functionality
  being made available in an add-on package called BrailleR. Functions in this package
  are intended to make graphical information available in text form.
