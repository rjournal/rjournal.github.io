title: 'FHDI: An R Package for Fractional Hot Deck Imputation'
abstract: Fractional hot deck imputation (FHDI), proposed by Kalton and Kish (1984)
  and investigated by Kim and Fuller (2004), is a tool for handling item nonresponse
  in survey sampling. In FHDI, each missing item is filled with multiple observed
  values yielding a single completed data set for subsequent analyses. An R package
  FHDI is developed to perform FHDI and also the fully efficient fractional imputation
  (FEFI) method of (Fuller and Kim, 2005) to impute multivariate missing data with
  arbitrary missing patterns. FHDI substitutes missing items with a few observed values
  jointly obtained from a set of donors whereas the FEFI uses all the possible donors.
  This paper introduces FHDI as a tool for implementing the multivariate version of
  fractional hot deck imputation discussed in Im et al. (2015) as well as FEFI. For
  variance estimation of FHDI and FEFI, the Jackknife method is implemented, and replicated
  weights are provided as a part of the output.
