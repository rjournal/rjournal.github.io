title: '[binGroup2](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=binGroup2): Statistical Tools
  for Infection Identification via Group Testing'
abstract: 'Group testing is the process of testing items as an amalgamation, rather
  than separately, to determine the binary status for each item. Its use was especially
  important during the COVID-19 pandemic through testing specimens for SARS-CoV-2.
  The adoption of group testing for this and many other applications is because members
  of a negative testing group can be declared negative with potentially only one test.
  This subsequently leads to significant increases in laboratory testing capacity.
  Whenever a group testing algorithm is put into practice, it is critical for laboratories
  to understand the algorithm''s operating characteristics, such as the expected number
  of tests. Our paper presents the [binGroup2](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=binGroup2)
  package that provides the statistical tools for this purpose. This R package is
  the first to address the identification aspect of group testing for a wide variety
  of algorithms. We illustrate its use through COVID-19 and chlamydia/gonorrhea applications
  of group testing. '
