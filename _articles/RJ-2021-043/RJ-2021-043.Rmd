# Introduction

Light is perhaps the most basic everyday experience. Light emission that
is *not* caused by the heating of a substance is called luminescence or
'cold light'. Various fields exploit this phenomenon. For instance,
Earth Sciences and archaeology determine the timing of past events
(e.g., last sunlight exposure or heating) with a technique called
luminescence dating. Since 2012, the luminescence-dating (or more
general trapped-charge dating) community has gradually adapted R as a
universal tool to analyze, model, and visualize their data. Relevant
related CRAN packages are:

![[RLumCarlo](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=RLumCarlo) simulates
luminescence production in natural minerals such as quartz using Monte
Carlo methods. Input is fairly simple (energy-band) models simulating
movements of, e.g., electrons in the crystal lattice of quartz. The
probability of observing such transitions is a function of energy input
in the form of light, heat, or ionizing radiation (e.g., $\beta$- or
$\gamma$-radiation). Th output of
[RLumCarlo](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=RLumCarlo) is a
luminescence curve. This is the light output observed when electrons
descend from a higher energy state to a lower energy state emitting part
of the energy difference as light.](figures/Fig0-1.png){#fig:Fig0
width=".6\\textwidth"}
:::

The luminescence production process is a stochastic process involving
discrete random state transitions of subatomic particles. In the case of
luminescence, this translates to electrons (and holes) moving to
different energy levels, e.g., in the crystal lattice of the natural
mineral quartz. Such processes are ideal for Monte Carlo (MC)
simulations, and their application has a long and propelling history in
physics [cf. @Landau:2015vp].
Figure$~$[1](#fig:Fig0){reference-type="ref" reference="fig:Fig0"}
summarizes the purpose of
[RLumCarlo](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=RLumCarlo) developed to
simulate luminescence signals in semiconductors and insulators (e.g.,
quartz) using MC methods. To that end,
[RLumCarlo](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=RLumCarlo) employs simple
(energy-band) models that describe the physical processes in, e.g., the
quartz crystal, to simulate xy-curves (luminescence curves). The
modeling output expresses the evolution of the light production
(luminescence process) over time.

Our contribution, and so
[RLumCarlo](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=RLumCarlo), sits on
precedent work by @Pagonis:2014cs, @Pagonis:2014gu, @Pagonis:2019hk, and
@Pagonis:2020bt. The included collection of energy-band models for
different stimulation modes adapted to MC methods are valuable for,
e.g., studying the impact of model parameters on the signal-related
stochastic uncertainties or statistic effects in tiny, dosimetric
systems. Technically, our approach is closely related to the simulation
of birth-and-death processes [for a review on birth-and-death process
cf. @Novozhilov:2006hd]. Each simulation run describes a Markov process.
However, in our case, we allow only a reduction of an initial number of
particles (i.e., only death processes).

Herein, we will not derive the full theoretical background of the
models, but we will focus on the technical aspects of the package design
and the integration of the MC methods. Such a presentation was beyond
the scope of previous articles [e.g., @Pagonis:2019hk; @Pagonis:2020bt],
but it is likely of interest to a broader community.

We structured our contribution as follows. The introduction continues
with a brief paragraph on luminescence and the term 'cold light'. After
that, we detail the rationales for our contribution by recalling
conventional modeling approaches in the field. Readers familiar with
these topics may safely skip this part. The subsequent section outlines
the concept and the implementation of
[RLumCarlo](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=RLumCarlo), including
code examples. The remainder addresses (A) the implementation of a
virtual dosimetric system to simulate weak spatial correlation of
dosimetric cluster groups. (B) We outline how
[RLumCarlo](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=RLumCarlo) can simulate
more complex models compared to other solutions, with respect to its
strengths and limitations. An outlook outlining the potential to
implement more interactions between models will close our manuscript.

::: {#cold-light-in-a-nutshell}
## 'Cold light' in a nutshell
:::

Light emissions of semiconductors or insulators *after* exposure to
ionizing radiation is a luminescence phenomenon now and then paraphrased
as 'cold light'. The term luminescence relates to light production *not*
purely caused by the heating of a substance, a condition called
'incandescence' or black body radiation, but a phenomenon expressing the
inherent capacity of a material (dosimeter) to emit light (energy) in
the ultraviolet to infrared wavelength range [e.g.,
@Newton:1957wr; @Mahesh_1989fk]. Heat-related luminescence phenomena of
solids have been explored systematically in physics since the 1930s
[@Urbach_1930fk] to characterize materials and understand charge
transfers in dosimeters [e.g., @McKeever_1983ly; @Mahesh_1989fk]. The
amount of luminescence, in the context of this manuscript, correlates to
the energy absorbed by a dosimeter during ionizing irradiation. The
closest analogy to a dosimeter is a battery that can be charged by,
e.g., $\gamma$-radiation and discharges while emitting light. Natural
minerals such as quartz or feldspar are dosimeters. Defects and
impurities in their crystal lattice can trap charges (electrons or
holes) in metastable states between valence and conduction band. The
time an electron spends in such a state can vary from a fraction of a
second to millions of years, depending on the crystal lattice
configuration and the environmental conditions. The amount of
(potential) energy held by an electron in such a center is approximately
the energy difference between the valence band and the energy level of
the center. A transition of the electron to a lower energy state may
lead to a photon emission of the form
$E_{photon} = \hbar\omega_{nm} = E_{n} - E_{m}$[^1]. Energy input
('stimulation') can move the electron out of the defect and eventually
it recombines with a hole trapped at another defect ('recombination
centre'). Types of stimulation methods relevant for our contribution are
heat (thermally stimulated luminescence, TL), visible light (optically
stimulated luminescence, OSL), and infrared light (infrared stimulated
luminescence, IRSL).

Luminescence phenomena have versatile use in the fields of personal,
medical, and accidental dosimetry [e.g., @Yukihara_2011zr]. As
aforementioned, in Earth Sciences and archaeology, the luminescence of
natural minerals gained considerable attractiveness as a dating method
(luminescence dating). First attempts exploiting luminescence signals as
a chronological tool reach back to the 1950s
[@Daniels:1953hw; @Houtermans:1957vu; @Grogler_1958fk]. Nevertheless, it
needed a few decades more before the method took off and became today
one of the most frequently used dating methods on sediments for the last
250,000 years and beyond [e.g.,
@Aitken_1985dq; @Aitken_1998eu; @Bateman:2019wy].

# Towards Monte Carlo simulations

To explain luminescence production, @Johnson:1939iy and @Randall:1945je
introduced the first basic energy-band models. Today, most of the
commonly accepted luminescence models use series of more or less
complicated systems of differential equations [for an overview, see
@Chen:1997dr; @Botter-Jensen_2003uq; @Chen_2011ij] employing energy-band
models. Those models provide a proper phenomenological match with
measured data for various experimental designs by simulating electronic
transitions. 'Conventional' energy-band models available to simulate
luminescence production are developed as a set of nonlinear differential
equations. This brings some limitations:

1.  The models become complex easily and cannot be solved analytically.

2.  If numerical methods are used, some equations are numerically
    unstable, which may lead to wrong simulation results.

3.  A convenient assumption in many of such models is a great abundance
    of spatially uniformly distributed traps and recombination centers.
    However, this is not always the most prudent assumption. A spatial
    correlation and cluster formation of centers may exist for various
    reasons [cf. @Mandowski:1992ke; @Chen_2011ij; @Horowitz:2017eo].

4.  Deterministic models do not consider stochastic uncertainties and
    simulated curves are 'noise free'. These limits subsequent analyses
    for materials where such uncertainties would matter due to the low,
    finite, number of charge carriers, and in these scenarios,
    simulation results are used as reference data to test statistical
    models used for luminescence data analysis in general.

Modeling code for simulating luminescence production was often written
with the tools at hand, e.g., *Mathematica* [e.g., @Pagonis_2006ve],
which has led to a fragmentation of incompatible solutions. In 2016,
@Friedrich:2016kia introduced
[RLumModel](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=RLumModel) [@RLumModel],
pooling available kinetic (non-MC) models available for the luminescence
production in quartz. A tantamount suite of R code was presented
simultaneously by @Peng:2016jg. We will compare results from
[RLumModel](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=RLumModel) and
[RLumCarlo](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=RLumCarlo) at the end of
this manuscript.

MC simulations offer an alternative and are indispensable if the
simulation of defect clusters in combination with the analysis of
stochastic uncertainties is desired. Usually, the underlying models are
very simple, but can be combined to describe complex systems. Important
early work simulating TL using MC methods goes back to @Mandowski:1992ke
and @Kulkarni:1994dr. @Mandowski:1992ke tried to overcome the
prerequisite of a large number of sample carriers, and @Kulkarni:1994dr
investigated MC methods to overcome very long calculation times
encountered for numerical calculations in particular scenarios.
@Kulkarni:1994dr (p. 103) also reported a "statistical fluctuation"
(noise like scatter) caused by the MC simulations but considered this
more as a disadvantage. Later, @Pagonis:2020bt explicitly exploited this
as a feature, similar to birth-and-death processes and their related
random uncertainties, to investigate specifically the stochastic
uncertainties.

Before we start to detail
[RLumCarlo](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=RLumCarlo), a preceding
note of caution: Any attempt to answer the question of whether a
particular model may better explain the one or the other effect measured
in luminescence studies would open Pandora's box [e.g.,
@Horowitz:2017eo]. Consequently, we will not engage in such a
discussion. What we have implemented so far in
[RLumCarlo](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=RLumCarlo) can be
modified and exchanged. However, the underlying design concept remains
applicable.

# The concept of [RLumCarlo](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=RLumCarlo) {#the-concept-of}

[RLumCarlo](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=RLumCarlo) implements
energy-band models in a modular approach. Each model can simulate only
an isolated effect (e.g., a single curve, see below), but the package
design allows various combinations, e.g., in the form of clusters.
Hence, [RLumCarlo](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=RLumCarlo) can
evolve beyond a specific mathematical model through a combination of
simple models.

To that end, [RLumCarlo](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=RLumCarlo)
differs fundamentally from
[RLumModel](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=RLumModel), where the
collected models allow the simulation of complex phenomena and even
entire measurement sequences [@Friedrich:2016kia] but are self-contained
by design. In other words, simulations cannot evolve beyond a specific
mathematical model selected by the user. In
[RLumCarlo](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=RLumCarlo), the
implemented energy-band models can simulate only isolated effects (e.g.,
a single curve, see below), but the package design allows a combination
in the form of clusters. Throughout the text, we will use the word
'clusters' to (1) ascribe virtual units used in the MC simulation to run
independent random processes (henceforth MC clusters) and (2) to define
groups of defects (defect clusters) e.g., defined by their spatial
distance. Only the latter carry a physical meaning.

conduction band but take place locally with a constant recombination
rate. (C) Tunneling transition: The model consists of one trap and one
recombination center. Transitions take place from the excited state into
the recombination center without involving the conduction band, and the
recombination rate depends on the distance between electrons and holes.
All symbols are detailed in the package manual, the package vignette,
and the main text. Side note: For the creation of the plots we used
[scales](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=scales) and
[ggplot2](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=ggplot2)
(<https://github.com/JohannesFriedrich/EnergyBandModels>).](figures/Fig1-1.pdf){#fig:Fig1
width="140mm"}

To date, [RLumCarlo](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=RLumCarlo) ships
three simple energy-band models (Figure$~$
[2](#fig:Fig1){reference-type="ref" reference="fig:Fig1"}) to simulate
luminescence production using (A) delocalized transitions, (B) localized
transitions, and (C) excited state tunneling transitions. The models are
distinguished by the allowed routes of electrons involved in the
luminescence process from one energy state to another. Only the first
model (Figure$~$ [2](#fig:Fig1){reference-type="ref"
reference="fig:Fig1"}A) involves the conduction band, while the models
in Figures$~$[2](#fig:Fig1){reference-type="ref" reference="fig:Fig1"}B
and C limit the allowed electron pathways to energy levels below the
conduction band.

While the parameters differ from model to model and depend on the
stimulation mode (heat or light, continuous or ramped), key entities
remain alike across the models, such as the trap depth (the energy
difference of the electron state from the conduction band) $E$ (eV), the
attempt to escape frequency of an electron from the trap (short:
frequency factor) $s$ (s$^{-1}$), the temperature $T$ (K), and the
trapped concentration of electrons $n$ (cm$^{-3}$) in the trap. $N$
(models A and B) is the total number of available electrons in cm$^{-3}$
and $\rho'$ is the dimensionless density of recombination centers [model
C, @Huntley:2006gs]. The symbols $A_n$, $A_m$, and $A$ (model A), $B$
and $A$ (model B), and $B$, $A$, and $r'$ (model C) plotted next to the
arrows in Figure$~$ [2](#fig:Fig1){reference-type="ref"
reference="fig:Fig1"} parametrize, simply put, the rates of the
electronic transitions.

The conditions of the simulations are defined through these parameters,
with $n$ being the crucial number. Once the electrons have all
recombined, the simulation may still continue, but the luminescence
signal is zero. As we will detail below, the essential point of the MC
simulation, from the physical point of view, is that these
concentrations become dimensionless, absolute numbers in a finite
system.

Each model supports up to four different stimulation modes (Figure$~$
[3](#fig:Fig2){reference-type="ref" reference="fig:Fig2"}), i.e., the
type of energy input (light or heat) and its modulation (continuous or
ramped).

As an example, we will detail the mathematical background and its
implementation for delocalized transitions below. For all other models,
we may refer to the cited literature as well as the package manual.

::: {#conceptional-overview-of-the-implementation}
## Conceptional overview of the implementation
:::

The basic implementation of the MC processes as a software algorithm
consists of two nested loops. The outer loop iterates over a time
$0<t\leqslant t_{max}$ with $t \in \mathbb{R} > 0$. The inner part loops
over particles $0<j\leqslant n$ with $n \in \mathbb{Z}$. The model tests
a random number, newly sampled with replacement in each run, against a
threshold $P$. If the sampled random number is smaller than $P$, the
absolute number of particles is reduced by one. The code below shows the
basic algorithm outlined above for the radioactive decay, which we have
chosen because it can be found in standard textbooks [e.g.,
@Landau:2015vp]. Below we used R code for illustrative reasons, while
the package implementation is written in C++.

for (j in 1:n)

if (runif(1) \< P && n \> 0) n \<- n - 1

if (n \> 0) remaining\[t\] \<- n
:::

For example, the algorithm starts with 1,000 particles. In time instant
$t_1$, the random number was smaller for two particles $j_6$ and
$j_{576}$. Hence, in time instant $t_2$, the inner loop iterates only
over $j = \{1,2,...,998\}$ particles. The absolute number of remaining
particles for each $t$ is stored in a vector of length
$t_{max}/\Delta t$. This vector is the observed signal curve (in the
case of luminescence, the righthand side graph on the green board in
Figure$~$ [1](#fig:Fig0){reference-type="ref" reference="fig:Fig0"}).

::: {#implementation-example-for-the-otor-model}
## Implementation example for the OTOR model
:::

The implementation for luminescence production in
[RLumCarlo](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=RLumCarlo) is very
similar. To exemplify the adaptation of the models to be run as an MC
simulation, we have selected the one-trap one-recombination center
(OTOR) model [based on @Halperin:1960gr] for TL. Our description below
follows @Pagonis:2014cs.

The OTOR model for TL can be expressed with the following set of
differential equations:

$$\frac{dn}{dt} = -ns~exp\big(-\frac{E}{k_{B}T}\big) + n_c(N-n)A_{n}$$

$$\frac{dn_{c}}{dt} = -\frac{dn}{dt} - n_{c}mA_{m}$$

$$I_{TL}(t) = -\frac{dm}{dt}= n_{c}mA_{m}.$$

Beyond already mentioned symbols, we used in the equations $I_{TL}$, the
time-dependent intensity, and $n_c$ (cm$^{-3}$), the current
concentration of electrons in the conduction band. The concentration of
recombination centers is represented by $m$ (cm$^{-3}$), where for
reasons of charge neutrality $m = n + n_{c}$. $A_{n}$ and $A_{m}$ (both
in cm$^{3}\,$s$^{-1}$) are the capture coefficients for traps and
recombinations centers, respectively. $k_{B}$ (eV$\,$K$^{-1}$) is the
Boltzmann constant and $T$ (K), the absolute temperature.

By assuming quasi-static equilibrium conditions [@Chen_2011ij]
$$\Big|\frac{dn_{c}}{dt}\Big| \ll \Big|\frac{dn}{dt}\Big|,\Big|\frac{dm}{dt}\Big|~~;~~ n_{c} \ll n, ~~ 
n \simeq m,$$

the resulting TL intensity becomes the general one trap equation, GOT:

$$I_{TL}(t) = -\frac{dn}{dt} = s~exp(-\frac{E}{k_{B}T})~\frac{A_{m}n^{2}}{(N-n)A_{n} + nA_{m}}.$$

$$T = T_{0} + \beta \times t,$$

with $T$ (K) and $T_{0}$ (K) being temperatures, $\beta$ (K$\,$s$^{-1}$)
the (heating) rate, and $t$ (s) the simulation time.
$p(t) = s~exp(-\frac{E}{k_{B}T})$ is the rate of thermal excitation, and
$R = \frac{A_{n}}{A_{m}}$ is the dimensionless retrapping ratio. The
translation into a finite system with a discrete distribution of charge
carriers [cf. @Mandowski:1991ha; @Mandowski:1994fi], can be expressed
through

$$\chi n,\chi N \rightarrow{} \bar{n}, \bar{N},$$

and the differential equation becomes a difference equation:

$$I_{TL}(t) = -\frac{1}{\beta}\frac{\Delta \bar{n}}{\Delta t} = p(t) \frac{\bar{n}^2}{\bar{N}R + \bar{n}(1-R)}.$$

$\chi$ (cm$^3$) is a constant, $\bar{n},\bar{N} \in \mathbb{Z}$, and
$\Delta t = 1\,$s is an appropriate time interval. $R$ is the
dimensionless re-trapping ratio in the finite system. To simulate the
luminescence process, the related Markov process renders similar to the
theory of birth-and-death processes [e.g., @Novozhilov:2006hd], where
the population (here of electrons) decreases over continuous time with
the probability to observe a transition within $\Delta t$ being
$P = \mu_{\bar{n}} \Delta t$ (here $\mu_{\bar{n}}$ is the "death-rate"
in s$^{-1}$) until the population is depleted. The so-called 'brute
force' approach [e.g., @Landau:2015vp] tests the population of electrons
($\bar{n}$) per integer time step sequentially by comparing it against a
random number sampled with replacement from a continuous distribution
$r \sim \mathcal{U}(0,1)$ against the conditional probability $P$ for an
electron to get evicted from the trap. In our case, $P$ is calculated as
follows:

$$p(t) \times \delta t \times \frac{n}{\bar{N}R + \bar{n}(1-R)}.$$

The factor $\delta t$ allows values of $\Delta t \neq 1$ while ensuring
that $P \ll 1$. $p(t)$ depends on the stimulation mode and the chosen
model. For TL (functions named `run_MC_TL_<model>()`) and isothermal TL
(functions named `run_MC_ISO_<model>()`) applying the localized or
delocalized model $p(t)$ becomes:

$$p(t) = s~exp(-\frac{E}{k_{B}T}),$$

and for TL, from tunneling transitions it reads:

$$p(t) = s~exp(-\frac{E}{k_{B}T})~exp(-\rho'^{-1/3}r'),$$

with $\rho'$ being the dimensionless concentration of recombination
centers, and $r'$ being the dimensionless tunneling radius
[@Huntley:2006gs]. The basic structure in
[RLumCarlo](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=RLumCarlo) is, however,
identical, except for the models based on excited-state tunneling. Here,
an additional outer loop iterates over the dimensionless tunneling
radius $0 \leqslant r' \leqslant 2$ [@Huntley:2006gs].

interfaced via [Rcpp](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=Rcpp). Helper
functions support graphical and terminal
feedback.](figures/Fig3-1.pdf){#fig:Fig3 width=".8\\textwidth"}
:::

In Figure$~$ [4](#fig:Fig3){reference-type="ref" reference="fig:Fig3"},
we outline the basic layout of
[RLumCarlo](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=RLumCarlo). Two design
decisions stand out: (1) Each stimulation mode/energy-band model
combination has its own exported R function commencing with the prefix
`run_MC`. (2) These functions interface one C++ function, each via
[Rcpp](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=Rcpp) [@Rcpp] (for an
overview, see the vignette of
[RLumCarlo](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=RLumCarlo)). The R
functions provide a convenient user interface, and the C++ functions
constitute the workhorse, as shown in the modeling core (Figure$~$
[4](#fig:Fig3){reference-type="ref" reference="fig:Fig3"}). While the
apparent reason for using C++ was speed, the implementation could have
been programmed more concisely, i.e., completely in C++ instead of
interfacing C++ with R. However, we wanted to allow code inspection by
non-specialists from our field, who may wish to implement other models
alike. We found that the separation of the user interface (in R) from
the modeling core (in C++) aligns best with our premise of simplicity
and flexibility.

As indicated above in the example implementation algorithm, each
simulation run [@Kulkarni:1994dr used the term 'particle tracking']
starts with $n > 1$ and ends at $t_{max}$, while $I(t) = 0$ for $n = 0$.
In reality, one has to execute several simulation runs separately
(henceforth 'MC clusters', to be distinguished from defect clusters),
either to reduce the statistical fluctuation or to estimate the
stochastic error [@Kulkarni:1994dr].
[RLumCarlo](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=RLumCarlo) runs the
simulations in virtual MC clusters on single or multicore systems using
[parallel](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=parallel) [@parallel],
[doParallel](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=doParallel)
[@doParallel], and [foreach](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=foreach)
[@foreach] supported by helper functions (Figure$~$
[4](#fig:Fig3){reference-type="ref" reference="fig:Fig3"}), to summarize
results and to provide S3-class based graphical output.

# Simple illustrative examples

![Exemplary comparison of TL signals simulated for all three
[RLumCarlo](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=RLumCarlo) models: (A)
delocalized (DELOC), (B) localized (LOC), and (C) tunneling (TUN).
General physical parameters, such as $E$ (1.45$\,$eV), $s$
($3.5\times10^{12}\,$s$^{-1}$), and the stimulation temperature
(100--450$\,^{\circ}$C) were kept constant for all
models.](figures/Fig4-1.pdf){#fig:Fig4 width="140mm"}

Simulations start with a call of the respective function, e.g., for `TL`
using the `DELOC` model `run_MC_TL_DELOC()` or `run_MC_TL_LOC()` for the
`LOC` model, respectively (see
Figures$~$[2](#fig:Fig1){reference-type="ref" reference="fig:Fig1"}A-B).

::: Sinput
results \<- run_MC_TL_DELOC( s = 3.5e12, E = 1.45, clusters = 10,
n_filled = 200, R = 1, times = 100:450)
:::

The function parameter names follow the terminology used for the
mathematical expression of the models as closely as possible. For
example, `E` and `s` are $E$ (trap depth in eV) and $s$ (frequency
factor in s$^{-1}$). `R` ($R$ in Figure$~$
[3](#fig:Fig2){reference-type="ref" reference="fig:Fig2"}) is the
so-called re-trapping ratio, expressing the chance an electron of *not*
passing into the conduction band, and `n_filled` is $\bar{n}$, the
number of electrons at the beginning of the simulation. The duration of
the simulation on the time domain (which is not the duration of the
computation) is set by `times`. The parameter `clusters` sets the number
of MC clusters, i.e., the number of Markov chains. High numbers in
`clusters` increase the confidence in the simulation output at the cost
of more computation time.

The output can be passed to a dedicated plot function
(`plot_RLumCarlo()`). The function supports a couple of standard plot
arguments, such as `main` for the title of the plot, which is passed
down to `graphics::plot.default()` via `...` (type `?dots` in the R
terminal).

(C) Stochastic uncertainty structure from
(B).](figures/Fig5-1.pdf){#fig:Fig5 width="140mm"}

The parameter `n_filled` can be a vector enabling different starting
conditions for each MC cluster.
Figure$~$[5](#fig:Fig4){reference-type="ref" reference="fig:Fig4"}A
shows the graphical output for delocalized transitions along with the
simulation results for `TL` stimulation using localized (Figure$~$
[5](#fig:Fig4){reference-type="ref" reference="fig:Fig4"}B) and
tunneling transitions (Figure$~$ [5](#fig:Fig4){reference-type="ref"
reference="fig:Fig4"}C). The output is an object of class
`RLumCarlo_Model_Output`, which is a `list` comprising a
multi-dimensional `array` (one slice per MC cluster) with the resulting
luminescence signal and a `numeric` vector for the stimulation time.

Currently we provide S3-generics for `summary()` and `c()`. The first
one is also used internally by `plot_RLumCarlo()` to melt the array into
a `data.frame` before plotting. The plot output adapts to the used
stimulation mode provided via an attribute with each output object.

A straightforward application for this kind of simulation is the study
of the impact of physical parameters on the luminescence signal output
and the estimation of the stochastic uncertainties, which cannot be
achieved with the deterministic approach of differential equations.

We provide more, always up-to-date examples with the package vignette,
where we also compiled a table with meaningful physical parameter ranges
for each model.

::: {#advanced-examples-and-further-considerations}
## Advanced examples and further considerations
:::

The examples so far presented may not appear very sophisticated, and
still, they allow insight that goes beyond a simple educational purpose
of simulating luminescence based on phenomenological models.
@Pagonis:2020bt, who used a preliminary version of
[RLumCarlo](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=RLumCarlo), addressed in
detail the stochastic uncertainties of TL and OSL models. These
uncertainties come into play in nano-dosimetric materials with a small
number of defect clusters where the "finite-size" [@Mandowski:1991ha] of
the system starts to matter in terms of a presumed spatial correlation
of defect cluster groups. To some extent, this should also be true for
systems exposed to high-energy radiation causing defect clusters [e.g.,
@Mandowski:1991ha; @Mandowski:1992ke]. Previously in this paper, we have
used the term 'MC clusters'. For a start, in
[RLumCarlo](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=RLumCarlo), 'MC clusters'
entail independent and continuous Monte Carlo Markov chains employed to
simulate luminescence production, starting with a particular number of
electrons in the system. Whether the processes are run in parallel or
sequentially has no impact on the outcome, except for computation speed.
In other words, 'MC clusters' carry no meaning regarding the underlying
physics. However, as mentioned above, 'MC clusters' from different
models (with the same stimulation mode) can be concatenated (see
Figure$~$ [6](#fig:Fig5){reference-type="ref" reference="fig:Fig5"}B-C)
to simulate defect clusters (also, dosimetric clusters), to which we can
attribute physical meaning.

::: {#spatial-correlation}
### Spatial correlation
:::

To simulate a three-dimensional (dosimetric) system, we can add meaning
to MC clusters by reinterpreting them as dosimetric clusters. From the
modeling perspective, nothing changes, but MC clusters gain a
connotation of having a physical meaning.

Figure$~$[7](#fig:Fig6){reference-type="ref" reference="fig:Fig6"}A
illustrates the situation of model combinations transferred into a
virtual, three-dimen-sional dosimetric system. Since all defect clusters
are distributed evenly over the system, the distance to each neighboring
point is identical, and it is a constant rather than a variable. In
other words, the spatial distance between neighboring points does not
matter and is of no relevance for the simulation but here chosen for
illustrative reasons only. Figure$~$[7](#fig:Fig6){reference-type="ref"
reference="fig:Fig6"}B represents a situation that takes one step
further. Here, the points are randomly distributed over the system, and
points form groups (defect cluster groups). Additionally,
[RLumCarlo](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=RLumCarlo) supports the
mixing of models for the same stimulation mode as in Figure$~$
[7](#fig:Fig6){reference-type="ref" reference="fig:Fig6"}A (not shown
here). The driving idea of the implementation is the assumption of an
individual spatial ordering of defects in a, e.g., quartz crystal to
which the luminescence production process might be assigned based on
models mentioned above.

Such a system can be created in
[RLumCarlo](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=RLumCarlo) via
`create_ClusterSystem()`. The function distributes points randomly with
their coordinates:

$$x_1,y_1,z_1,...,x_k,y_k,z_k \sim \mathcal{U}(0,1)~\mathtt{|}~k \in \mathbb{Z}.$$

::: center
![A dosimetric system with three possible approaches of cluster
correlation and interaction. (A) Models can be mixed, but no spatial
correlation is realized, and no interaction possible. This is the basic
mode in [RLumCarlo](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=RLumCarlo). (B)
Clusters are grouped by their Euclidean distance, and models can be
mixed. Electrons are distributed according to the spatial distance of
clusters and also models can be mixed (not shown in the figure). The
advanced mode in
[RLumCarlo](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=RLumCarlo). (C) Clusters
can interact with each other and even exchange electrons. This last
stage is subject to future developments of
[RLumCarlo](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=RLumCarlo).](figures/Fig6-1.pdf){#fig:Fig6
width="100%"}
:::

Then, the Euclidean distance between the points is determined with
`stats:dist()`, which is used by `stats:hclust()` to group the defect
clusters ($\Xi$). To avoid too many small groups, we then cut the
cluster tree using `stats:cutree()`, with the outcome shown in Figure$~$
[7](#fig:Fig6){reference-type="ref" reference="fig:Fig6"}B. The
selection of `stats:hclust()` and `stats:cutree()` for defining the
clusters is somewhat arbitrary and might be refined in the future.
Therefore, more research, supported by measurements, is needed.

Now, any function from
[RLumCarlo](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=RLumCarlo) can be used,
and the output of `create_ClusterSystem()` is taken as input for the
argument `clusters`. For example:

::: Sinput
run_MC_TL_LOC(s = 3.5e12, E = 1.45, n_filled = 1000, clusters =
create_ClusterSystem(100))
:::

creates a system with 100 randomly distributed defect clusters. If the
simulation is run in such a mode, the meaning of `n_filled` changes.
Previously, it defined the number of electrons in each cluster
($\bar{n}_{cl_i}$). However, now the same parameter defines the total
number of electrons in the entire system. The number of electrons in the
$i$th cluster ($\bar{n}_{cl_i}$) is then an integer fraction of
electrons available in each cluster group
($\bar{n}_{\Xi_{i}} = \mathtt{n\_filled}/ N_{\Xi}$, with $N_{\Xi}$ the
total number of cluster groups). The more clusters are in one group, the
less electrons are available per cluster in the group and vice versa.
While this is a very simple approach, it allows us to simulate basic
spatial correlation. Figure$~$[7](#fig:Fig6){reference-type="ref"
reference="fig:Fig6"}C drafts a better way of mimicking spatial
interaction of clusters, which is, however, not yet part of
[RLumCarlo](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=RLumCarlo). While it
would be, based on the designed system, easy from the programming
perspective, the needed equations to describe to exchange electrons are
yet to be developed.

::: {#comparison-to}
### Comparison to [RLumModel](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=RLumModel) {#comparison-to}
:::

In the remainder, we want to compare simulation results from
[RLumCarlo](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=RLumCarlo), with other
types of solutions, such as
[RLumModel](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=RLumModel) which uses
coupled differential equations to simulate luminescence production.
[RLumModel](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=RLumModel) was selected
since it was developed by some of the authors of this contribution.
However, in theory, simple scripts using any existing models to simulate
luminescence should work as well (as long as the models are comparable).

In contrast to
[RLumCarlo](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=RLumCarlo),
[RLumModel](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=RLumModel) input values
for physical parameters are preset.
[RLumModel](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=RLumModel) encourages
users to write a virtual luminescence signal measurement sequence, which
is processed based on a pre-defined model with preset physical
parameters.

For the comparison, we have selected a TL curve simulated with the
luminescence model for quartz by @Bailey_2001yo.

::: Sinput
output \<- RLumModel::model_LuminescenceSignals( sequence = list(IRR =
c(20, 10, 1), TL = c(20, 400, 1)), model = \"Bailey2001\" )
:::

The results are shown in Figure$~$ [8](#fig:Fig7){reference-type="ref"
reference="fig:Fig7"} (here already with the simulation results from
[RLumCarlo](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=RLumCarlo) plotted on top
of it). The output of
[RLumModel](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=RLumModel) is a
three-peak-shaped curve. To simulate the same curve in
[RLumCarlo](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=RLumCarlo), we used the
parameters from the model by @Bailey_2001yo (his Table 1), e.g., for the
first peak:

`N_e` was divided by a constant to reduce the computation time. The
dimensionless parameter `R` corresponds to $B$ (s$^{-1}$) in
@Bailey_2001yo. The other two peaks were simulated alike (objects
`TL230` and `TL325`) before all three objects were combined via:

::: Sinput
object \<- c(TL110, TL230, TL325)
:::

and plotted on the top of the curve derived from
[RLumModel](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=RLumModel):

The argument `plot_value = "sum"` was used to plot the total count sum
instead of its average. The additional function injected via the
argument `FUN` corrects the TL curves for a phenomenon known as thermal
quenching [@Wintle_1975kx]. This is a reduction of luminescence
production efficiency at higher temperatures. The chosen quenching
parameters follow roughly data measured for quartz by @Friedrich:2018ha.
In summary, the results in Figure$~$ [8](#fig:Fig7){reference-type="ref"
reference="fig:Fig7"} show that even complex luminescence models can be
simulated through the combination of clusters, which brings us back to
the initial 'simplicity' premise of
[RLumCarlo](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=RLumCarlo). Still, a big
'but' remains. Luminescence models such as those proposed by
@Bailey_2001yo or @Pagonis:2008bl go beyond single curve simulations.
Their purpose is to deliver a general kinetic model for luminescence
production of, e.g., quartz, including the simulation of trap filling by
irradiation and the simulation of the thermal activation history of the
mineral. By contrast, so far all simulations in
[RLumCarlo](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=RLumCarlo) start with a
predefined number of electrons in a trap and are not by default limited
to a specific dosimeter.
[RLumCarlo](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=RLumCarlo) can model more
complex luminescence phenomena, but not in a pre-described way out of
the box. Instead,
[RLumCarlo](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=RLumCarlo) is more like a
patch box with each model representing a socket ready to be flexibly
rewired in many ways to simulate cascades of luminescence production.
Due to the nature of the chosen MC approach, in theory (adhering to the
patch box picture), the number of sockets is not limited.

[RLumModel](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=RLumModel) and

# Summary

The modeling of luminescence phenomena (cold light) of semiconductors
and insulators after having received ionizing radiation is a challenging
task. MC methods allow setting up flexible and simple systems to
simulate luminescence with a finite number of charge carriers. This
enables users to address effects usually observed for nano-dosimetric
systems, and it provides insight into the stochastic uncertainty
structure. We presented
[RLumCarlo](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=RLumCarlo), which
renders, to our best knowledge, the first open-source and ready-to-use
compilation of basic MC luminescence models for different stimulation
modes (so far CW-OSL, LM-OSL, ISO-TL, and TL). We showed that the output
from different models, which are simulated in separate MC chains in
virtual clusters, can be combined to either simulate more complex
systems or to mimic simple spatial correlations between cluster groups.
The way of the implementation does not limit
[RLumCarlo](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=RLumCarlo) to a specific
dosimeter (e.g., quartz). In this light,
[RLumCarlo](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=RLumCarlo) can be used in
education, and research to test the impact of model parameters, such as
cluster sizes and related stochastic uncertainties. Furthermore,
[RLumCarlo](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=RLumCarlo) can help in in
formulating research hypotheses and test them with commonly accepted or
new models, still to be developed.

Future work will implement more models to run as MC simulation, e.g.,
for irradiation processes in crystals (including its luminescence
output: radiofluorescence) and for an advanced interaction of clusters.
