title: 'gset: An R Package for Exact Sequential Test of Equivalence Hypothesis Based
  on Bivariate Non-Central t-Statistics'
abstract: 'The R package gset calculates equivalence and futility boundaries based
  on the exact bivariate non-central t test statistics. It is the first R package
  that targets specifically at the group sequential test of equivalence hypotheses.
  The exact test approach adopted by gset neither assumes the large-sample normality
  of the test statistics nor ignores the contribution to the overall Type I error
  rate from rejecting one out of the two one-sided hypotheses under a null value.
  The features of gset include: error spending functions, computation of equivalence
  boundaries and futility boundaries, either binding or nonbinding, depiction of stagewise
  boundary plots, and operating characteristics of a given group sequential design
  including empirical Type I error rate, empirical power, expected sample size, and
  probability of stopping at an interim look due to equivalence or futility.'
