title: Hypothesis Tests for Multivariate Linear Models Using the car Package
abstract: The multivariate linear model is Y = X B + E (n×m) (n× p)( p×m) (n×m) The
  multivariate linear model can be fit with the lm function in R, where the left-hand
  side of the model comprises a matrix of response variables, and the right-hand side
  is specified exactly as for a univariate linear model (i.e., with a single response
  variable). This paper explains how to use the Anova and linearHypothesis functions
  in the car package to perform convenient hypothesis tests for parameters in multivariate
  linear models, including models for repeated-measures data.
