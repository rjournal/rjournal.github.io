title: 'IRTest: An R Package for Item Response Theory with Estimation of Latent Distribution'
description: ' Item Response Theory (IRT) models the relationship between respondents''
  latent traits and their responses to specific items. One key aspect of IRT is the
  assumption about the distribution of the latent variables, which can influence parameter
  estimation accuracy. While a normal distribution has been conventionally assumed,
  this may not always be appropriate. When the assumption of normality is violated,
  latent distribution estimation (LDE) can enhance parameter estimation accuracy by
  accommodating non-normal characteristics. Despite there being several methods proposed
  for LDE in IRT, there is a lack of software designed to handle their implementation.
  This paper introduces [IRTest](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=IRTest), a software
  program developed for IRT analysis that incorporates LDE procedures. It outlines
  the statistical foundation of LDE, details the functionalities of IRTest, and provides
  examples of IRT analyses to demonstrate the software''s applications. '
