title: 'rotations: An R Package for SO(3) Data'
abstract: 'In this article we introduce the rotations package which provides users
  with the ability to simulate, analyze and visualize three-dimensional rotation data.
  More specifically it includes four commonly used distributions from which to simulate
  data, four estimators of the central orientation, six confidence region estimation
  procedures and two approaches to visualizing rotation data. All of these features
  are available for two different parameterizations of rotations: three-by-three matrices
  and quaternions. In addition, two datasets are included that illustrate the use
  of rotation data in practice.'
