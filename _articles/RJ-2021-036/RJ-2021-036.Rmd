title: 'DChaos: An R Package for Chaotic Time Series Analysis'
abstract: Chaos theory has been hailed as a revolution of thoughts and attracting
  ever-increasing attention of many scientists from diverse disciplines. Chaotic systems
  are non-linear deterministic dynamic systems which can behave like an erratic and
  apparently random motion. A relevant field inside chaos theory is the detection
  of chaotic behavior from empirical time-series data. One of the main features of
  chaos is the well-known initial-value sensitivity property. Methods and techniques
  related to testing the hypothesis of chaos try to quantify the initial-value sensitive
  property estimating the so-called Lyapunov exponents. This paper describes the main
  estimation methods of the Lyapunov exponent from time series data. At the same time,
  we present the DChaos library. R users may compute the delayed-coordinate embedding
  vector from time series data, estimates the best-fitted neural net model from the
  delayed-coordinate embedding vectors, calculates analytically the partial derivatives
  from the chosen neural nets model. They can also obtain the neural net estimator
  of the Lyapunov exponent from the partial derivatives computed previously by two
  different procedures and four ways of subsampling by blocks. To sum up, the DChaos
  package allows the R users to test robustly the hypothesis of chaos in order to
  know if the data-generating process behind time series behaves chaotically or not.
  The package's functionality is illustrated by examples.
