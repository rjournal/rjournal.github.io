title: 'ftsa: An R Package for Analyzing Functional Time Series'
abstract: Recent advances in computer recording and storing technology have tremendously
  increased the presence of functional data, whose graphical representation can be
  infinite-dimensional curve, image, or shape. When the same functional object is
  observed over a period of time, such data are known as functional time series. This
  article makes first attempt to describe several techniques (centered around functional
  principal component analysis) for modeling and forecasting functional time series
  from a computational aspect, using a readily-available R addon package. These methods
  are demonstrated using age-specific Australian fertility rate data from 1921 to
  2006, and monthly sea surface temperature data from January 1950 to December 2011.
