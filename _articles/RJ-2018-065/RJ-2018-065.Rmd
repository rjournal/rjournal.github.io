title: 'NetworkToolbox: Methods and Measures for Brain, Cognitive, and Psychometric
  Network Analysis in R'
abstract: This article introduces the NetworkToolbox package for R. Network analysis
  offers an intuitive perspective on complex phenomena via models depicted by nodes
  (variables) and edges (correlations). The ability of networks to model complexity
  has made them the standard approach for modeling the intricate interactions in the
  brain. Similarly, networks have become an increasingly attractive model for studying
  the complexity of psychological and psychopathological phenomena. NetworkToolbox
  aims to provide researchers with state-of-the-art methods and measures for es timating
  and analyzing brain, cognitive, and psychometric networks. In this article, I introduce
  NetworkToolbox and provide a tutorial for applying some the packageâ€™s functions
  to personality data.
