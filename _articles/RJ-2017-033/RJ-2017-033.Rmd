title: 'Counterfactual: An R Package for Counterfactual Analysis'
abstract: The *Counterfactual* package implements the estimation and inference methods
  of @ChernozhukovFernandez-ValMelly2013 for counterfactual analysis. The counterfactual
  distributions considered are the result of changing either the marginal distribution
  of covariates related to the outcome variable of interest, or the conditional distribution
  of the outcome given the covariates. They can be applied to estimate quantile treatment
  effects and wage decompositions. This paper serves as an introduction to the package
  and displays basic functionality of the commands contained within.

# Introduction {#sec:Introduction}

Using econometric terminology, we can often think of a counterfactual
distribution as the result of a change in either the distribution of a
set of covariates $X$ that determine the outcome variable of interest
$Y$, or the relationship of the covariates with the outcomes, that is, a
change in the conditional distribution of $Y$ given $X$. Counterfactual
analysis consists of evaluating the effects of such changes. The
[*Counterfactual*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=Counterfactual)
package implements the methods of [@ChernozhukovFernandez-ValMelly2013]
for counterfactual analysis. It contains commands to estimate and make
inference on quantile effects constructed from counterfactual
distributions. The counterfactual distributions are estimated using
regression methods such as classical, duration, quantile and
distribution regressions. The inference on the quantile effect function
can be pointwise at a specific quantile index or uniform over a range of
specified quantile indexes.

We start by giving a simple example of counterfactual analysis. Suppose
we would like to analyze the wage differences between men and women. Let
$0$ denote the population of men and let $1$ denote the population of
women. The variable $Y_{j}$ denotes wages and $X_{j}$ denotes job
market-relevant characteristics that affect wages for populations $j=0$
and $j=1$. The conditional distribution functions $F_{Y_0|X_0}(y|x)$ and
$F_{Y_1|X_1}(y|x)$ describe the stochastic assignment of wages to
workers with characteristics $x$, for men and women, respectively. Let
$F_{Y\left\langle 0|0\right\rangle }$ and
$F_{Y\left\langle 1|1\right\rangle }$ represent the observed
distribution function of wages for men and women, and let
$F_{Y\left\langle 0|1\right\rangle }$ represent the distribution
function of wages that would have prevailed for women had they faced the
men's wage schedule $F_{Y_0|X_0}$:
$$\label{eq:DefCounter}  F_{Y\left\langle 0|1\right\rangle }(y):=\int_{\mathcal{X}_{1}}F_{Y_{0}|X_{0}}(y|x)dF_{X_{1}}(x).  
(\#eq:DefCounter)$$
The latter distribution is called counterfactual, since it does not
arise as a distribution from any observable population. Rather, this
distribution is constructed by integrating the conditional distribution
of wages for men with respect to the distribution of characteristics for
women. This quantity is well defined if $\mathcal{X}_0$, the support of
men's characteristics, includes $\mathcal{X}_1$, the support of women's
characteristics, namely $\mathcal{X}_1\subset \mathcal{X}_0$.

Let $F^{\leftarrow}$ denote the quantile or left-inverse function of the
distribution function $F$. The difference in the observed wage quantile
function between men and women can be decomposed in the spirit of
[@Oaxaca1973] and [@Blinder1973] as
$$\label{eq:decomp}
F^{\leftarrow}_{Y\left\langle 1|1\right\rangle }-F^{\leftarrow}_{Y\left\langle 0|0\right\rangle}=[F^{\leftarrow}_{Y\left\langle 1|1\right\rangle}-F^{\leftarrow}_{Y\left\langle 0|1\right\rangle}]+[F^{\leftarrow}_{Y\left\langle 0|1\right\rangle }-F^{\leftarrow}_{Y\left\langle 0|0\right\rangle }],   (\#eq:decomp)$$
where the first term in brackets is due to differences in the wage
structure and the second term is a composition effect due to differences
in characteristics. These counterfactual effects are well defined
econometric parameters and are widely used in empirical analysis, for
example, the first term of the decomposition is a measure of gender wage
discrimination. In Section [3.2](#sec:examples) we consider an empirical
example where $0$ denotes the population of nonunion workers and $1$
denotes the population of union workers. In this case the the wage
structure effect corresponds to the treatment effect of union or union
premium. It is important to note that these effects do not necessarily
have a causal interpretation without additional conditions that are
spelled out in [@ChernozhukovFernandez-ValMelly2013].

# The Counterfactual package

## Getting started

To get started using the package *Counterfactual* for the first time,
issue the command

``` r
> install.packages("Counterfactual")
```

into your R browser to install the package in your computer. Once the
package has been installed, you can use the package *Counterfactual*
during any R session by simply issuing the command

``` r
> library(Counterfactual)
```

Now you are ready to use the function *counterfactual* and data sets
contained in *Counterfactual*. For general questions about the package
you may type

``` r
> help(package = "Counterfactual")
```

to view the package help file, or for more questions about a specific
function you can type `help(function-name)`. For example, try:

``` r
> help(counterfactual)
```

or simply type

``` r
> ?counterfactual
```

The command *counterfactual* has the general syntax:

``` r
> counterfactual(formula, data, weights, na.action = na.exclude, 
+                group, treatment = FALSE, decomposition = FALSE,
+                transformation = FALSE, counterfactual_var, 
+                quantiles, method = "qr", 
+                trimming = 0.005, nreg = 100, scale_variable, 
+                counterfactual_scale_variable, 
+                censoring = 0, right = FALSE, nsteps = 3, 
+                firstc = 0.1, secondc = 0.05, noboot = FALSE, 
+                weightedboot = FALSE, seed = 8, robust = FALSE, 
+                reps = 100, alpha = 0.05, first = 0.1, 
+                last = 0.9, cons_test = 0, printdeco = TRUE, 
+                sepcore = FALSE, ncore=1)
```

To describe the different options of the command we need to provide some
background on methods for counterfactual analysis.

## Setting for counterfactual analysis

Consider a general setting with two populations labeled by
$k\in \mathcal{K} = \{0,1\}$. For each population $k$ there is the $%
d_{x}$-vector $X_{k}$ of covariates and the scalar outcome $Y_{k}$. The
covariate vector is observable in all populations, but the outcome is
only observable in populations $j\in \mathcal{J}\subseteq \mathcal{K}$.
Let $F_{X_{k}}$ denote the covariate distribution in population
$k\in \mathcal{K},$ and $%
F_{Y_{j}|X_{j}}$ and $Q_{Y_{j}|X_{j}}$ denote the conditional
distribution and quantile functions in population $j\in \mathcal{J}$. We
denote the support of $X_{k}$ by $%
\mathcal{X}_{k}\subseteq \mathbb{R}^{d_{x}}$, and the region of interest
for $%
Y_{j}$ by $\mathcal{Y}_{j}\subseteq \mathbb{R}$. The refer to $j$ as the
reference population(s) and to $k$ as the counterfactual population(s).

The reference and counterfactual populations in the wage examples
correspond to different groups such as men and women or nonunion and
union workers. We can also generate counterfactual populations by
artificially transforming a reference population. Formally, we can think
of $X_k$ as being created through a known transformation of $X_j$:
$$\label{eq:transform}
X_{k}=g_{k}(X_{j}),\quad\mathrm{where}\quad g_{k}:\mathcal{X}_{j}\rightarrow\mathcal{X}_{k}.   (\#eq:transform)$$
This case covers adding one unit to the first covariate,
$X_{1,k}=X_{1,j}+1$, holding the rest of the covariates constant. The
resulting quantile effect becomes the *unconditional* quantile
regression, which measures the effect of a unit change in a given
covariate component on the unconditional quantiles of $Y$. For example,
this type of counterfactual is useful for estimating the treatment
effect of smoking during pregnancy on infant birth weights. Another
possible transformation is a mean preserving redistribution of the first
covariate implemented as
$X_{1,k} = (1-\alpha) E[X_{1,j}] + \alpha X_{1,j}$. These and more
general types of transformation defined in (\@ref(eq:transform)) are
useful for estimating the effect of a change in taxation on the marginal
distribution of food expenditure or the effect of cleaning up a local
hazardous waste site on the marginal distribution of housing prices
([@Stock1991]). We give an example of this type of transformation in
Section [3.1](#Sec:example2).

The reference and counterfactual populations can be specified to
*counterfactual* in two ways that accommodate the previous two cases:

1.  If the option *group* has been specified, then $j$ is the population
    defined by *group* and $k$ is the population defined by *group=1*.
    This means that both $X$ and $Y$ are observed in *group=0*, but only
    $X$ needs to be observed in *group=1*. When both $X$ and $Y$ are
    observed in *group=1*, the option *treatment=TRUE* specifies that
    the structure or treatment effect should be computed, whereas the
    default option *treatment=FALSE* specifies that the composition
    effect should be computed; see the definition of the structure and
    composition effects in the decomposition (\@ref(eq:decomp)). If in
    addition to *treatment=TRUE* the option *decomposition=TRUE* is
    selected, then the entire decomposition (\@ref(eq:decomp)) is
    reported including the composition, structure and total effects.
    Note that we can reverse the roles of the populations defined by an
    indicator variable *vargroup* by setting either *group=vargroup* or
    *group=1-vargroup*.

2.  Alternatively, the option *counterfactual_var* can be used to
    specify the covariates in the counterfactual population. In this
    case, the names on the right handside of *formula* contain the
    variables in $X_j$ and *counterfactual_var* contains the variables
    in $X_k$. The option *transformation=TRUE* should be used when $X_k$
    is generated as a transformation of $X_j$, e.g., equation
    (\@ref(eq:transform)). The list passed to *counterfactual_var* must
    contain exactly the same number of variables as the list of
    independent variables in *formula* and the order of the variables in
    the list matters.

Counterfactual distribution and quantile functions are formed by
combining the conditional distribution in the population $j$ with the
covariate distribution in the population $k$, namely:
$$\begin{aligned}
& F_{Y{\langle j|k\rangle }}(y):=\int_{\mathcal{X}%
_{k}}F_{Y_{j}|X_{j}}(y|x)dF_{X_{k}}(x),\ \ y\in \mathcal{Y}_{j},
\\
& Q_{Y{\langle j|k\rangle }}(\tau ):=F_{Y{\langle j|k\rangle }}^{\leftarrow
}(\tau ),\ \ \tau \in (0,1),\label{define:counter} 
\end{aligned}   (\#eq:definecounter)$$
where $(j,k) \in \mathcal{J}\mathcal{K}$, and
$F_{Y{\langle j|k\rangle }}^{\leftarrow }(\tau) = \inf \{y \in \mathcal{Y}_{j}: F_{Y{\langle j|k\rangle }}(y) \geq \tau \}$
is the left-inverse function of $F_{Y{\langle j|k\rangle }}$. The main
interest lies in the quantile effect (QE) function, defined as the
difference of two counterfactual quantile functions over a set of
quantile indexes $\mathcal{T} \subset (0,1)$:
$$\Delta(\tau) =  Q_{Y{\langle j|k\rangle }}(\tau ) - Q_{Y{\langle j|j \rangle }}(\tau ), \ \tau \in \mathcal{T},$$
where $j \in \mathcal{J}$ and $k \in \mathcal{K}$. In the example of
Section [1](#sec:Introduction), we obtain the composition effect with
$j=0$ and $k=1$. When $Y_k$ is observed, then we can construct the
structure effect or treatment effect on the treated
$$\Delta(\tau) =  Q_{Y{\langle k|k \rangle }}(\tau ) - Q_{Y{\langle j|k \rangle }}(\tau ), \ \tau \in \mathcal{T},$$
by specifying the option *group* and setting *treatment=TRUE*. In the
example of Section [1](#sec:Introduction), we obtain the wage structure
effect with $j=0$ and $k=1$, i.e. setting *group=1* and
*treatment=TRUE*. If in addition we select the option
*decomposition=TRUE*, then we obtain the entire decomposition
(\@ref(eq:decomp)) including the composition, structure and total
effects. The total effect is
$$\Delta(\tau) =  Q_{Y{\langle k|k \rangle }}(\tau ) - Q_{Y{\langle j|j \rangle }}(\tau ), \ \tau \in \mathcal{T}.$$
The set $\mathcal{T}$ is specified with the option *quantiles*, which
enumerates the quantile indexes of interested and should be a vector
containing numbers between 0 and 1.

To estimate the QE function we need to model and estimate the
conditional distribution $F_{Y_{j}|X_{j}}$ and covariate distribution
$F_{X_k}$. We estimate the covariate distribution using the empirical
distribution, and consider several regression based methods for the
conditional distribution including classical, quantile, duration, and
distribution regression. Given the estimators of the conditional and
covariate distributions $\hat{F}_{Y_{j}\vert X_{j}}$ and
$\hat{F}_{X_{k}}$, the estimator of each counterfactual distribution is
obtained by the plug-in rule, namely
$$\hat{F}_{Y\left\langle j|k\right\rangle}(y)=\int_{\mathcal{X}_{k}}\hat{F}_{Y_{j}\vert X_{j}}(y\vert x)d\hat{F}_{X_{k}}(x),
 y\in\mathcal{Y}_{j}.$$
Then, the estimator of the QE function is also obtained by the plug-in
rule as
$$\hat \Delta(\tau) =  \hat{F}_{Y\left\langle j|k\right\rangle}^{\leftarrow}(\tau) - \hat{F}_{Y\left\langle j|j\right\rangle}^{\leftarrow}(\tau), \ \ \tau \in \mathcal{T},$$
or
$$\hat \Delta(\tau) =  \hat{F}_{Y\left\langle k|k\right\rangle}^{\leftarrow}(\tau) - \hat{F}_{Y\left\langle j|k\right\rangle}^{\leftarrow}(\tau), \ \ \tau \in \mathcal{T},$$
if we define the counterfactual population with *group* and set
*treatment=TRUE*. If in addition to *treatment=TRUE*, we select
*decomposition=TRUE*, then the plug-in estimator of the total effect is
$$\hat \Delta(\tau) =  \hat{F}_{Y\left\langle k|k\right\rangle}^{\leftarrow}(\tau) - \hat{F}_{Y\left\langle j|j\right\rangle}^{\leftarrow}(\tau), \ \ \tau \in \mathcal{T}.$$

### Estimation of conditional distribution

In this section we assume that we have samples
$\{(Y_{ji}, X_{ji}): i = 1, \ldots, n_j \}$ composed of independent and
identically distributed copies of $(Y_j,X_j)$ for all populations
$j \in \mathcal{J}$. The conditional distribution $F_{Y_j|X_j}$ can be
modeled and estimated directly, or throught the conditional quantile
function, $Q_{Y_j|X_j}$, using the relation
$$\label{eq:QEDEtran}
F_{Y_{j}|X_{j}}(y|x)\equiv\int_{(0,1)}1\{Q_{Y_{j}|X_{j}}(u|x)\leq y\}du.   (\#eq:QEDEtran)$$

The option *formula* specifies the outcome $Y$ as the left hand side
variable and the covariates $X$ as the right hand side variable(s). The
option *method* allows to select the method to estimate the conditional
distribution. The following methods are implemented:

1.  *method = \"qr\"*, which is the default, implements the quantile
    regresion estimator of the conditional distribution
    $$\label{qr:dist}
    \hat F_{Y_{j}|X_{j}}(y|x) = \varepsilon + \int_{(\varepsilon,1-\varepsilon)}1\{x'\hat \beta_j(u) \leq y\}du,   (\#eq:qrdist)$$
    where $\varepsilon$ is a small constant that avoids estimation of
    tail quantiles, and $\hat \beta(u)$ is the [@KoenkerBassettJr1978]
    quantile regression estimator
    $$\hat \beta_j(u) = \arg \min_{b \in \mathbb{R}^{d_x}} \sum_{i=1}^{n_j} [u - 1\{Y_{ji} \leq X_{ji}'b\}] [Y_{ji} - X_{ji}'b].$$
    The quantile regression estimator calls the R package
    [*quantreg*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=quantreg)
    [@quantreg-package]. The option *trimming* specifies the value of
    the trimming parameter $\varepsilon$, with default value
    $\varepsilon = 0.005$. The option *nreg* sets the number of quantile
    regressions used to approximate the integral in (\@ref(eq:qrdist)),
    with a default value of $100$ such that
    $(\varepsilon,1-\varepsilon)$ is approximated by the grid
    $\{\varepsilon, \varepsilon + (1-2\varepsilon)/99, \varepsilon + 2 (1-2\varepsilon)/99,  \ldots, 1 - \varepsilon \}$.
    This method should be used only with continuous dependent variables.

2.  *method = \"loc\"* implements the estimator of the conditional
    distribution
    $$\label{loc:dist}
    \hat F_{Y_{j}|X_{j}}(y|x) = \frac{1}{n_j} \sum_{i=1}^{n_j} 1 \{Y_{ji} - X_{ji}'\hat \beta_j \leq y - x'\hat \beta_j \},   (\#eq:locdist)$$
    where $\hat \beta_j$ is the least square estimator
    $$\label{eq:ols}
    \hat \beta_j = \arg \min_{b \in \mathbb{R}^{d_x}} \sum_{i=1}^{n_j}  (Y_{ji} - X_{ji}'b)^2.   (\#eq:ols)$$
    The estimator (\@ref(eq:locdist)) is based on a restrictive location
    shift model that imposes that the covariates $X$ only affect the
    location of the outcome $Y$.

3.  *method = \"locsca\"* implements the estimator of the conditional
    distribution
    $$\label{sca:dist}
    \hat F_{Y_{j}|X_{j}}(y|x) = \frac{1}{n_j} \sum_{i=1}^{n_j} 1 \left\{\frac{Y_{ji} - X_{ji}'\hat \beta_j}{\exp (X_{2ji}'\hat \gamma_j/2)} \leq \frac{y - x'\hat \beta_j}{\exp (x_{2j}'\hat \gamma_j/2)} \right\},   (\#eq:scadist)$$
    where $\hat \beta_j$ is the least square estimator (\@ref(eq:ols)),
    $X_{2j} \subseteq X_{j}$ with $\dim X_{2j} = d_{x_2},$ and
    $$\hat \gamma_j = \arg \min_{g \in \mathbb{R}^{d_{x_2}}} \sum_{i=1}^{n_j}  (\log (Y_{ji} - X_{ji}'\hat \beta_j)^2 - X_{2ji}'g)^2.$$
    The option *scale_variable* specifies the covariates $X_{2j}$ that
    affect the scale of the conditional distribution. The option
    *counterfactual_scale_variable* selects the counterfactual scale
    variables when the counterfactual population is specified using
    *counterfactual_var*. By default, *R* would use all the covariates
    as *scale_variable* and *counterfactual_scale_variable =
    counterfactual_var*. The estimator (\@ref(eq:scadist)) is based on a
    restrictive location scale shift model that imposes that the
    covariates $X$ only affect the location and scale of the outcome
    $Y$.

4.  *method = \"cqr\"* implements the censored quantile regression
    estimator of the conditional distribution, which is the same as
    (\@ref(eq:qrdist)) with $\hat \beta(u)$ replaced by the
    [@Chernozhukov2002] censored quantile regression estimator. The
    options *trimming* and *nreg* apply to this method with the same
    functionality as for the *qr* method. Moreover, a variable
    containing a censoring indicator $C_j$ must be specified with
    *censoring*. The censored quantile regression estimator has
    three-steps by default. The number of steps can be increased by the
    option *nsteps*. In the first step, the censoring probabilities are
    estimated by a logit regression of the censoring indicator $C_j$ on
    all the covariates $X_j$. Then, for each quantile index $u$, the
    observations with sufficiently low censoring probabilities relative
    to $u$ are selected. We allow for misspecification of the logit by
    excluding the observations that could theoretically be used but have
    censoring probabilities in the highest *firstc* quantiles, with a
    default of $0.1$, i.e. $10\%$ of the observations. In the second
    step, standard linear quantile regressions are estimated on the
    samples defined in step one. Using the estimated quantile
    regressions, we define a new sample of observations that can be
    used. This sample consists of all observations for which the
    estimated conditional quantile is above the censoring point. Again,
    we throw away observations in the lowest *secondc* quantiles of the
    distribution of the residuals, with a default of $0.05$, i.e. $5\%$
    of the observations. Step three consists in a new linear quantile
    regression using the sample defined in step two. Step three is
    repeated if *nsteps* is above 3. This method should be used only
    with censored dependent variables.

5.  *method = \"cox\"* implements the duration regression estimator of
    the conditional distribution function
    $$\label{cox:dist}
    \hat F_{Y_{j}|X_{j}}(y|x) = 1 - \exp(-\exp(\hat t(y) - x'\hat \beta)),   (\#eq:coxdist)$$
    where $\hat \beta$ is the Cox estimator of the regression
    coefficients and $\hat t(y)$ is the Cox estimator of the baseline
    integrated hazard function [@Cox1972]. The Cox estimator calls the R
    package [*survival*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=survival)
    [@survival-package]. The estimator (\@ref(eq:coxdist)) is based on a
    restrictive transformation location shift model that imposes that
    the covariates $X$ only affect the location of a monotone
    transformation of the outcome $t(Y)$, i.e.
    $$t(Y_j) = X_j'\beta_j + V_j,$$
    where $V_j$ has an extreme value distribution and is independent of
    $X_j$. This method should be used only with nonnegative dependent
    variables.

6.  *method = \"logit\"* implements the distribution regression
    estimator of the conditional distribution with logistic link
    function
    $$\label{dr:dist}
    \hat F_{Y_{j}|X_{j}}(y|x) = \Lambda(x'\hat \beta(y)),   (\#eq:drdist)$$
    where $\Lambda$ is the standard logistic distribution function, and
    $\hat \beta(y)$ is the distribution regression estimator
    $$\label{eq:dr}
    \hat \beta(y) = \arg \max_{b \in \mathbb{R}^{d_x}} \sum_{i=1}^{n_j} \left[1\{Y_{ji} \leq y\} \log \Lambda(X_{ij}'b) + 1\{Y_{ij} > y\} \log \Lambda(-X_{ji}'b) \right].   (\#eq:dr)$$
    The estimator (\@ref(eq:drdist)) is based on a flexible model where
    each covariate can have a heterogenous effect at different parts of
    the distribution. This method can be used with continuous dependent
    variables and censored dependent variables with fixed censoring
    point.

7.  *method = \"probit\"* implements the distribution regression
    estimator of the conditional distribution with normal link function,
    i.e. where $\Lambda$ is the standard normal distribution function in
    (\@ref(eq:drdist)) and (\@ref(eq:dr)).

8.  *method = \"lpm\"* implements the linear probability model estimator
    of the conditional distribution
    $$\hat F_{Y_{j}|X_{j}}(y|x) = x'\hat \beta(y),$$
    where $\hat \beta(y)$ is the least squares estimator
    $$\hat \beta(y) = \arg \min_{b \in \mathbb{R}^{d_x}} \sum_{i=1}^{n_j} (1\{Y_{ji} \leq y\} -X_{ij}'b )^2.$$
    This method might produce estimates of the conditional distribution
    outside the interval $[0,1]$.

For the methods (2)--(8), the option *nreg* sets the number of values of
$y$ to evaluate the estimator of the conditional distribution function.
These values are uniformly distributed among the observed values of
$Y_j$. If *nreg* is greater than the number of observed values of $Y_j$,
then all the observed values are used.

## Inference

The command *counterfactual* reports pointwise and uniform confidence
intervals for the QEs over a prespecified set of quantile indexes. The
construction of the intervals rely on functional central limit theorems
and bootstrap functional central limit theorems for the empirical QEs
derived in [@ChernozhukovFernandez-ValMelly2013]. In particular, the
pointwise intervals are based on the normal distribution, whereas the
uniform intervals are based on two resampling schemes: empirical and
weighted bootstrap. Thus, the $(1-\alpha)$ confidence interval for
$\Delta(\tau)$ on $\mathcal{T}$ has the form
$$\{ \hat \Delta(\tau) \pm c_{1-\alpha} \hat \Sigma(\tau) : \tau \in \mathcal{T}\},$$
where $\hat \Sigma(\tau)$ is the standard error of $\hat \Delta(\tau)$
and $c_{1-\alpha}$ is a critical value. There are two options to obtain
$\hat \Sigma(\tau)$. The default option *robust=FALSE* computes the
bootstrap standard deviation of $\hat \Delta(\tau)$; whereas the option
*robust=TRUE* computes the bootstrap interquartile range rescaled with
the normal distribution,
$\hat \Sigma(\tau) = (q_{0.75}(\tau) - q_{0.25}(\tau))/(z_{0.75} - z_{0.25})$
where $q_p(\tau)$ is the $p$th quantile of the bootstrap draws of
$\hat \Delta(\tau)$ and $z_p$ is the $p$th quantile of the standard
normal. The pointwise critical value is $c_{1-\alpha} = z_{1-\alpha}$,
and the uniform critical value is $c_{1-\alpha} = \hat t_{1-\alpha},$
where $\hat t_{1-\alpha}$ is a bootstrap estimator of the $(1-\alpha)$th
quantile of the Kolmogorov-Smirnov maximal t-statistic
$$t = \sup_{\tau \in \mathcal{T}} |\hat \Delta(\tau) - \Delta(\tau) | / \hat \Sigma(\tau).$$

In addition to the intervals, *counterfactual* reports the p-values for
several functional tests based on two test-statistic: Kolmogorov-Smirnov
and the Cramer-von-Misses-Smirnov. The null-hypotheses considered are

1.  Correct parametric specification of the model for the conditional
    distribution. This test compares the empirical distribution of the
    outcome $Y_j$ with the estimate of the counterfactual distribution
    in the reference population
    $$\hat F_{Y\left\langle j|j\right\rangle }(y):=\int_{\mathcal{X}_{j}}\hat F_{Y_{j}|X_{j}}(y|x)d\hat F_{X_{j}}(x).$$
    The power of this specification test might be low because it only
    uses the implications of the conditional distribution on the
    counterfactual distribution. For example, the test is not
    informative for the linear probability and logit models where the
    counterfactual distribution in the reference population is identical
    to the empirical distribution by construction. If *group* is
    specified and *treatment=TRUE* is selected, then the test is
    performed in the population defined by *group=1*. If in addition the
    option *decomposition=TRUE* is selected, then the test is performed
    in the populations defined by *group=0* and *group=1*, and in the
    combined population including both *group=0* and *group=1*.

2.  Zero QE at all the quantile indexes of interest: $\Delta(\tau) = 0$
    for all $\tau \in \mathcal{T}$. This is stronger than a zero average
    effect. Other null hypotheses of constant quantile effect (but at a
    different level than 0) can be added with the option *cons_test*.

3.  Constant QE at all quantile indexes of interest:
    $\Delta(\tau) = \Delta(0.5)$ for all $\tau \in \mathcal{T}$.

4.  First-order stochastic dominance: $\Delta(\tau) \geq 0$ for all
    $\tau \in \mathcal{T}$.

5.  Negative first-order stochastic dominance: $\Delta(\tau) \leq 0$ for
    all $\tau \in \mathcal{T}$.

The options of *counterfactual* related to inference are:

1.  *noboot = TRUE* suppresses the bootstrap. The bootstrap can be very
    demanding in terms of computation time. Therefore, it is recommended
    to switch it off for the exploratory analysis of the data.

2.  *weightedboot = TRUE* selects weighted bootstrap with standard
    exponential weights. The default *weightedboot = FALSE* selects
    empirical bootstrap with multinomial weights. We recommend weighted
    bootstrap when the covariates include categorical variables with
    small cell sizes to avoid singular designs in the bootstrap draws.

3.  *reps* specifies the number of bootstrap replications. This number
    will matter only if the bootstrap has not be suppressed. The default
    is 100.

4.  *alpha* specifies the significance level of the tests and confidence
    intervals. Note that the confidence level of the confidence interval
    is 1 - *alpha*. Thus, the default value of $0.05$ produces $95\%$
    confidence intervals.

5.  *first* and *last* select the subset of quantile indexes of interest
    for inference. The tails of the distribution should not be used
    because standard asymptotic does not apply to these parts. The
    needed amount of tail trimming depends on the sample size and on the
    distribution of the dependent variable. *first* sets the lowest
    quantile index used and *last* sets the highest quantile index used.
    The default values are 0.1 and 0.9 so that
    $\mathcal{T} = [0.1, 0.9]$.

6.  *cons_test* add tests of the null hypothesis that $\Delta(\tau)  =$
    *const_test* for all $\tau$ between *first* and *last*. The null
    hypothesis that $\Delta(\tau)  = 0$ for all $\tau$ between *first*
    and *last* is tested by default. The null hypothesis that the
    quantile effects are constant is also tested by default.

## Parallel computing

The command *counterfactual* provides functionality for parallel
computing, which is specially useful to speed up the execution of the
bootstrap. There are two options related to parallel computing:

1.  *setcore* specifies whether multiple cores should be used. The
    default value *setcore = FALSE* turns off the parallel computing.

2.  *ncore* selects the number of cores to use for parallel computing.
    The information of this option is only used when parallel computing
    is switched on with *setcore = TRUE*.

# Empirical examples

We consider two empirical examples to illustrate the functionality of
the command *counterfactual*. The first example is an estimation of
Engel curves that includes a counterfactual analysis where the
counterfactual population is an artificial transformation of a reference
population. The second example is wage decomposition with respect to
union status where the reference and counterfactual populations
correspond to two different groups.

## Engel curves {#Sec:example2}

We use the classical Engel 1857 dataset to estimate the relationship
between food expenditure (*foodexp*) and annual household income
(*income*), and then report the estimates of the QE of a change in the
distribution of the annual household income that might be induced for
example by a variation in income taxation.[^1] We estimate the
conditional distribution with the quantile regression method, i.e.,
*method =\"qr\"*.

First, we generate the variable *counterfactual_income* with the
counterfactual values of income and plot the reference and
counterfactual income distributions. The counterfactual distribution
corresponds to a mean preserving spread of the distribution in the
reference population that reduces standard deviation by $25\%$.

``` r
> library(quantreg)
> data(engel)
> attach(engel)
> counter_income <- mean(income)+0.75*(income-mean(income))
> cdfx <- c(1:length(income))/length(income)
> plot(c(0,4000),range(c(0,1)), xlim =c(0, 4000), type="n", xlab = "Income", 
+      ylab="Probability")
> lines(sort(income), cdfx)
> lines(sort(counter_income), cdfx, lwd = 2, col = 'grey70')
> legend(1500, .2, c("Original", "Counterfactual"), lwd=c(1,2),bty="n", 
+        col=c(1,'grey70'))
```

![Figure 1: Observed and counterfactual distributions of
income](vignette-fig1.png){width="100%" alt="graphic without alt text"}

To estimate the QEs of this counterfactual change we turn on the option
*transformation* of *counterfactual* by setting *transformation = TRUE*,
and specify that the counterfactual values of the covariate *income* are
in the generated variable *counter_income* by setting
*counterfactual_var = counter_income*. This yields:

``` r
> qrres <- counterfactual(foodexp~income, counterfactual_var
+         = counter_income, transformation = TRUE)

We reject the simultaneous hypotheses of zero, constant, positive and
negative effect of the income redistribution at all the deciles. The QR
model for the conditional distribution cannot be rejected at
conventional significance levels.

Finally, we reestimate the QE function on the larger set of quantiles
$\{0.01, 0.02, \ldots , 0.99 \}$, and plot a uniform confidence band
over the subset $\{0.10, 0.11, \ldots , 0.90 \}$ constructed by
empirical bootstrap with 100 replications. In Figure [1](#fig:engel) we
can visually reject the functional hypotheses of zero, constant,
positive and negative effect at the percentiles considered. We use the
option *printdeco = FALSE* to suppress the display of the table of
results.

## Union premium {#sec:examples}

We use an extract of the U.S. National Longitudinal Survey of Young
Women (NLSW) for employed women in 1988 to estimate a wage decomposition
with respect to union status.[^2] The outcome variable $Y$ is the log
hourly wage (*lwage*), the covariates $X$ include job tenure in years
(*tenure*), years of schooling (*grade*), and total experience
(*ttl_exp*), and the union indicator *union* defines the reference and
counterfactual populations. We estimate the conditional distributions by
distribution regression with logistic link and duration regression,
i.e., *method =\"logit\"* and *method =\"cox\"*. We use weighted
bootstrap for the construction of uniform confidence intervals and
hypothesis tests and run parallel computing with 2 nodes.

We start by estimating the wage decomposition by logistic distribution
regression, where the counterfactual population is specified with
*group=union* with the options *treatment=TRUE* and *decomposition=TRUE*
to estimate the composition, structure and total effects. The structure
effect in this case correspond to the treatment effect of union on the
treated or union premium. The tables show that the union workers earn
higher wages than the nonumion workers throuoghout the distribution
although the union wage gap is decreasing in the quantile index. This
gap can be mostly explained by differences in tenure, education and
experience between union and nonunion workers in the upper tail of the
distribution and by the union premium in the rest of the distribution.

> attach(nlsw88)

Finally, we repeat the point and interval estimation using the duration
regression method with the option *method = \"cox\"*. Despite of relying
on a more restrictive model for the conditional distribution, the
duration regression estimates in Figure [3](#fig:union2) are similar to
the logit regression estimates in Figure [2](#fig:union).
