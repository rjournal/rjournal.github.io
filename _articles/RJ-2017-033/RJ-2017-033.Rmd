title: 'Counterfactual: An R Package for Counterfactual Analysis'
abstract: The Counterfactual package implements the estimation and inference methods
  of Cher nozhukov et al. (2013) for counterfactual analysis. The counterfactual distributions
  considered are the result of changing either the marginal distribution of covariates
  related to the outcome variable of interest, or the conditional distribution of
  the outcome given the covariates. They can be applied to estimate quantile treatment
  effects and wage decompositions. This paper serves as an introduction to the package
  and displays basic functionality of the commands contained within.
