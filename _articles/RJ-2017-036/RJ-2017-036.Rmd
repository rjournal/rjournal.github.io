title: Discrete Time Markov Chains with R
abstract: The markovchain package aims to provide S4 classes and methods to easily
  handle Discrete Time Markov Chains (DTMCs), filling the gap with what is currently
  available in the CRAN repository. In this work, I provide an exhaustive description
  of the main functions included in the package, as well as hands-on examples.
