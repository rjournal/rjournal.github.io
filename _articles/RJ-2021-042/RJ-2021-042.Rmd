title: Package wsbackfit for Smooth Backfitting Estimation of Generalized Structured
  Models
abstract: A package is introduced that provides the weighted smooth backfitting estimator
  for a large family of popular semiparametric regression models. This family is known
  as *generalized structured models*, comprising, for example, generalized varying
  coefficient model, generalized additive models, mixtures, potentially including
  parametric parts. The kernel-based weighted smooth backfitting belongs to the statistically
  most efficient procedures for this model class. Its asymptotic properties are well-understood
  thanks to the large body of literature about this estimator. The introduced weights
  allow for the inclusion of sampling weights, trimming, and efficient estimation
  under heteroscedasticity. Further options facilitate easy handling of aggregated
  data, prediction, and the presentation of estimation results. Cross-validation methods
  are provided which can be used for model and bandwidth selection.[^1]
