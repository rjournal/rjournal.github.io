# Introduction

*Differential Evolution* (DE) is a search heuristic introduced by
@StornPrice1997. Its remarkable performance as a global optimization
algorithm on continuous numerical minimization problems has been
extensively explored [@PriceStornLampinen2006]. DE has also become a
powerful tool for solving optimization problems that arise in financial
applications: for fitting sophisticated models [@GilliSchumann2009], for
performing model selection [@MaringerMeyer2008], and for optimizing
portfolios under non-convex settings [@KrinkPaterlini2011]. DE is
available in R with the package
[*DEoptim*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=DEoptim).

In what follows, we briefly sketch the DE algorithm and discuss the
content of the package *DEoptim*. The utility of the package for
financial applications is then explored by solving a non-convex
portfolio optimization problem.

# Differential Evolution

DE belongs to the class of genetic algorithms (GAs) which use
biology-inspired operations of crossover, mutation, and selection on a
population in order to minimize an objective function over the course of
successive generations [@Holland1975]. As with other evolutionary
algorithms, DE solves optimization problems by evolving a population of
candidate solutions using alteration and selection operators. DE uses
floating-point instead of bit-string encoding of population members, and
arithmetic operations instead of logical operations in mutation, in
contrast to classic GAs.

Let $\mathit{NP}$ denote the number of parameter vectors (members)
$\mathbf{x} \in \mathbb{R}^d$ in the population, where $d$ denotes
dimension. In order to create the initial generation, $\mathit{NP}$
guesses for the optimal value of the parameter vector are made, either
using random values between upper and lower bounds (defined by the user)
or using values given by the user. Each generation involves creation of
a new population from the current population members
$\{ \mathbf{x}_i \,|\, i = 1, \ldots,
\mathit{NP}\}$, where $i$ indexes the vectors that make up the
population. This is accomplished using *differential mutation* of the
population members. An initial mutant parameter vector $\mathbf{v}_i$ is
created by choosing three members of the population, $\mathbf{x}_{i_1}$,
$\mathbf{x}_{i_2}$ and $\mathbf{x}_{i_3}$, at random. Then
$\mathbf{v}_i$ is generated as

$$\mathbf{v}_i \doteq \mathbf{x}_{i_1} + F \cdot (\mathbf{x}_{i_2} - \mathbf{x}_{i_3}) \,,$$
where $F$ is a positive scale factor, effective values for which are
typically less than one. After the first mutation operation, mutation is
continued until $d$ mutations have been made, with a crossover
probability $\mathit{CR} \in [0,1]$. The crossover probability
$\mathit{CR}$ controls the fraction of the parameter values that are
copied from the mutant. Mutation is applied in this way to each member
of the population. If an element of the trial parameter vector is found
to violate the bounds after mutation and crossover, it is reset in such
a way that the bounds are respected (with the specific protocol
depending on the implementation). Then, the objective function values
associated with the children are determined. If a trial vector has equal
or lower objective function value than the previous vector it replaces
the previous vector in the population; otherwise the previous vector
remains. Variations of this scheme have also been proposed; see
@PriceStornLampinen2006.

Intuitively, the effect of the scheme is that the shape of the
distribution of the population in the search space is converging with
respect to size and direction towards areas with high fitness. The
closer the population gets to the global optimum, the more the
distribution will shrink and therefore reinforce the generation of
smaller difference vectors.

For more details on the DE strategy, we refer the reader to
@PriceStornLampinen2006 and @StornPrice1997.

## The package *DEoptim*

*DEoptim* [@DEoptim] was first published on CRAN in 2005. Since becoming
publicly available, it has been used by several authors to solve
optimization problems arising in diverse domains. We refer the reader to
@Antidisestablishmentarianism for a detailed description of the package.

*DEoptim* consists of the core function `DEoptim` whose arguments are:

-   `fn`: the function to be optimized (minimized).

-   `lower`, `upper`: two vectors specifying scalar real lower and upper
    bounds on each parameter to be optimized. The implementation
    searches between `lower` and `upper` for the global optimum of `fn`.

-   `control`: a list of tuning parameters, among which: `NP` (default:
    $10 \cdot d$), the number of population members and `itermax`
    (default: 200), the maximum number of iterations (i.e., population
    generations) allowed. For details on the other `control` parameters,
    the reader is referred to the documentation manual (by typing
    `?DEoptim`). For convenience, the function `DEoptim.control()`
    returns a list with default elements of `control`.

-   `...`: allows the user to pass additional arguments to the function
    `fn`.

The output of the function `DEoptim` is a member of the
[S3]{.sans-serif} class `DEoptim`. Members of this class have a `plot`
and a `summary` method that allow to analyze the optimizer's output.

Let us quickly illustrate the package's usage with the minimization of
the Rastrigin function in $\mathbb{R}^2$, which is a common test for
global optimization:

``` r
> Rastrigin <- function(x) \{
+   sum(x^2 - 10 * cos(2 * pi * x)) + 20
\}
```

The global minimum is zero at point $\mathbf{x} = (0,0)'$. A perspective
plot of the function is shown in Figure [1](#f:Rastrigin1).

![Figure 1: Perspective plot of the Rastrigin
function.](Rastrigin1.png){#f:Rastrigin1 width="8cm" alt="graphic without alt text"}

The function `DEoptim` searches for a minimum of the objective function
between `lower` and `upper` bounds. A call to `DEoptim` can be made as
follows:

``` r
> set.seed(1234)
> DEoptim(fn = Rastrigin,
+   lower = c(-5, -5),
+   upper = c(5, 5),
+   control = list(storepopfrom = 1))
```

The above call specifies the objective function to minimize,
`Rastrigin`, the lower and upper bounds on the parameters, and, via the
`control` argument, that we want to store intermediate populations from
the first generation onwards (`storepopfrom = 1`). Storing intermediate
populations allows us to examine the progress of the optimization in
detail. Upon initialization, the population is comprised of 50 random
values drawn uniformly within the `lower` and `upper` bounds. The
members of the population generated by the above call are plotted at the
end of different generations in Figure [2](#f:Rastrigin2). `DEoptim`
consistently finds the minimum of the function (market with an open
white circle) within 200 generations using the default settings. We have
observed that *DEoptim* solves the Rastrigin problem more efficiently
than the simulated annealing method available in the R function `optim`
(for all annealing schedules tried). Note that users interested in exact
reproduction of results should set the seed of their random number
generator before calling `DEoptim` (using `set.seed`). DE is a
randomized algorithm, and the results may vary between runs.

![Figure 2: The population (market with black dots) associated with
various generations of a call to DEoptim as it searches for the minimum
of the Rastrigin function at point $\mathbf{x} = (0,0)$' (market with an
open white circle). The minimum is consistently determined within 200
generations using the default settings of
DEoptim.](Rastrigin2.png){#f:Rastrigin2 width="100%" alt="graphic without alt text"}

Finally, note that *DEoptim* relies on repeated evaluation of the
objective function in order to move the population toward a global
minimum. Therefore, users interested in making *DEoptim* run as fast as
possible should ensure that evaluation of the objective function is as
efficient as possible. Using pure R code, this may often be accomplished
using vectorization. Writing parts of the objective function in a
lower-level language like C or Fortran may also increase speed.

# Risk allocation portfolios

Mean-risk models were developed in early fifties for the portfolio
selection problem. Initially, variance was used as a risk measure. Since
then, many alternative risk measures have been proposed. The question of
which risk measure is most appropriate is still the subject of much
debate. Value-at-Risk (VaR) and Conditional Value-at-Risk (CVaR) are the
most popular measures of downside risk. VaR is the negative value of the
portfolio return such that lower returns will only occur with at most a
preset probability level, which typically is between one and five
percent. CVaR is the negative value of the mean of all return
realizations that are below the VaR. There is a voluminous literature on
portfolio optimization problems with VaR and CVaR risk measures, see,
e.g., @FabianVeszpremi2008 and the references therein.

Modern portfolio selection considers additional criteria such as to
maximize upper-tail skewness and liquidity or minimize the number of
securities in the portfolio. In the recent portfolio literature, it has
been advocated by various authors to incorporate risk contributions in
the portfolio allocation problem. Qian's (2005) *Risk Parity Portfolio*
allocates portfolio variance equally across the portfolio components.
@Maillard2010 call this the *Equally-Weighted Risk Contribution (ERC)
Portfolio*. They derive the theoretical properties of the ERC portfolio
and show that its volatility is located between those of the minimum
variance and equal-weight portfolio. @ZhuLiSun2010 study optimal
mean-variance portfolio selection under a direct constraint on the
contributions to portfolio variance. Because the resulting optimization
model is a non-convex quadratically constrained quadratic programming
problem, they develop a branch-and-bound algorithm to solve it.

@BoudtCarlPeterson2010 propose to use the contributions to portfolio
CVaR as an input in the portfolio optimization problem to create
portfolios whose percentage CVaR contributions are aligned with the
desired level of CVaR risk diversification. Under the assumption of
normality, the percentage CVaR contribution of asset $i$ is given by the
following explicit function of the vector of weights
$\mathbf{w} \doteq (w_1,\ldots,w_d)'$, mean vector
$\mathbf{\mu} \doteq (\mu_1, \ldots, \mu_d)'$ and covariance matrix
$\mathbf{\Sigma}$:

$$\frac{w_i \left[-\mu_i + \frac{(\mathbf{\Sigma} \mathbf{w})_{i}}{\sqrt{\mathbf{w}' \mathbf{\Sigma} \mathbf{w}}}\frac{\phi(z_\alpha)}
{\alpha}\right]}{-\mathbf{w}' \mathbf{\mu} + \sqrt{\mathbf{w}' \mathbf{\Sigma} \mathbf{w}} \frac{\phi(z_\alpha)}{\alpha}} \,,$$
with $z_\alpha$ the $\alpha$-quantile of the standard normal
distribution and $\phi(\cdot)$ the standard normal density function.
Throughout the paper we set $\alpha=5\%$. As we show here, the package
*DEoptim* is well suited to solve these problems. Note that it is also
the evolutionary optimization strategy used in the package
[*PortfolioAnalytics*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=PortfolioAnalytics)
[@PortfolioAnalytics].

To illustrate this, consider as a stylized example a five-asset
portfolio invested in the stocks with tickers GE, IBM, JPM, MSFT and
WMT. We keep the dimension of the problem low in order to allow
interested users to reproduce the results using a personal computer.
More realistic portfolio applications can be obtained in a
straightforward manner from the code below, by expanding the number of
parameters optimized. Interested readers can also see the *DEoptim*
package vignette for a 100-parameter portfolio optimization problem that
is typical of those encountered in practice.

We first download ten years of monthly data using the function
`getSymbols` of the package
[*quantmod*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=quantmod) [@quantmod].
Then we compute the log-return series and the mean and covariance matrix
estimators. For on overview of alternative estimators of the covariance
matrix, such as outlier robust or shrinkage estimators, and their
implementation in portfolio allocation, we refer the reader to
@Wuertz2009 [Chapter 4]. These estimators might yield better performance
in the case of small samples, outliers or departures from normality.

``` r
> library("quantmod")
> tickers <- c("GE", "IBM", "JPM", "MSFT", "WMT")
> getSymbols(tickers, 
+   from = "2000-12-01", 
+   to   = "2010-12-31")
> P <- NULL
> for(ticker in tickers) \{
+   tmp <- Cl(to.monthly(eval(parse(text = ticker))))
+   P <- cbind(P, tmp)
+ \}
> colnames(P) <- tickers
> R <- diff(log(P))
> R <- R[-1,]
> mu <- colMeans(R)
> sigma <- cov(R)
```

We first compute the equal-weight portfolio. This is the portfolio with
the highest weight diversification and often used as a benchmark. But is
the risk exposure of this portfolio effectively well diversified across
the different assets? This question can be answered by computing the
percentage CVaR contributions with function `ES` in the package
[*PerformanceAnalytics*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=PerformanceAnalytics)
[@PerformanceAnalytics]. These percentage CVaR contributions indicate
how much each asset contributes to the total portfolio CVaR.

``` r
> library("PerformanceAnalytics")
> pContribCVaR <- ES(weights = rep(0.2, 5),
+   method = "gaussian",
+   portfolio_method = "component",
+   mu = mu,
+   sigma = sigma)\$pct_contrib_ES
> rbind(tickers, round(100 * pContribCVaR, 2))
        [,1]    [,2]    [,3]    [,4]    [,5]
tickers "GE"    "IBM"   "JPM"   "MSFT"  "WMT"
        "21.61" "18.6" "25.1" "25.39" "9.3"        
```

We see that in the equal-weight portfolio, 25.39% of the portfolio CVaR
risk is caused by the 20% investment in MSFT, while the 20% investment
in WMT only causes 9.3% of total portfolio CVaR. The high risk
contribution of MSFT is due to its high standard deviation and low
average return (reported in percent):

``` r
> round(100 * mu , 2)
   GE   IBM   JPM  MSFT   WMT
-0.80  0.46 -0.06 -0.37  0.0
> round(100 * diag(sigma)^(1/2), 2)
   GE   IBM   JPM  MSFT   WMT
8.90  7.95  9.65 10.47  5.33
```

We now use the function `DEoptim` of the package *DEoptim* to find the
portfolio weights for which the portfolio has the lowest CVaR and each
investment can contribute at most 22.5% to total portfolio CVaR risk.
For this, we first define our objective function to minimize. The
current implementation of *DEoptim* allows for constraints on the domain
space. To include the risk budget constraints, we add them to the
objective function through a penalty function. As such, we allow the
search algorithm to consider infeasible solutions. A portfolio which is
unacceptable for the investor must be penalized enough to be rejected by
the minimization process and the larger the violation of the constraint,
the larger the increase in the value of the objective function. A
standard expression of these violations is
$\alpha \times | \mbox{violation} |^p$. @CramaSchyns2003 describe
several ways to calibrate the scaling factors $\alpha$ and $p$. If these
values are too small, then the penalties do not play their expected role
and the final solution may be infeasible. On the other hand, if $\alpha$
and $p$ are too large, then the CVaR term becomes negligible with
respect to the penalty; thus, small variations of $\mathbf{w}$ can lead
to large variations of the penalty term, which mask the effect on the
portfolio CVaR. We set $\alpha = 10^3$ and $p=1$, but recognize that
better choices may be possible and depend on the problem at hand.

``` r
> obj <- function(w) \{
+   if (sum(w) == 0) \{ w <- w + 1e-2 \}
+   w <- w / sum(w)
+   CVaR <- ES(weights = w,
+     method = "gaussian",
+     portfolio_method = "component",
+     mu = mu,
+     sigma = sigma)
+   tmp1 <- CVaR\$ES
+   tmp2 <- max(CVaR\$pct_contrib_ES - 0.225, 0)
+   out <- tmp1 + 1e3 * tmp2
+ \}
```

The penalty introduced in the objective function is non-differentiable
and therefore standard gradient-based optimization routines cannot be
used. In contrast, `DEoptim` is designed to consistently find a good
approximation to the global minimum of the optimization problem:

``` r
> set.seed(1234)
> out <- DEoptim(fn = obj,
+   lower = rep(0, 5),
+   upper = rep(1, 5))
> out\$optim\$bestval
[1] 0.1143538
> wstar <- out\$optim\$bestmem
> wstar <- wstar / sum(wstar)
> rbind(tickers, round(100 * wstar, 2))
        par1    par2    par3    par4    par5
tickers "GE"    "IBM"   "JPM"   "MSFT"  "WMT"
        "18.53" "21.19" "11.61" "13.37" "35.3"
> 100 * (sum(wstar * mu) - mean(mu))
[1] 0.04827935
```

Note that the main differences with the equal-weight portfolio is the
low weights given to JPM and MSFT and the high weight to WMT. As can be
seen from the last two lines, this *minimum risk* portfolio has a higher
expected return than the equal weight portfolio. The following code
illustrates that DEoptim yields superior results than the gradient-based
optimization routines available in R.

``` r
> out <- optim(par = rep(0.2, 5), 
+  fn = obj,
+  method = "L-BFGS-B",
+  lower = rep(0, 5),
+  upper = rep(1, 5))
> out\$value
[1] 0.1255093
> out <- nlminb(start = rep(0.2, 5), 
+   objective = obj,
+   lower = rep(0, 5),
+   upper = rep(1, 5))
> out\$objective
[1] 0.1158250
```

Even on this relatively simple stylized example, the `optim` and
`nlminb` routines converged to local minima.

Suppose now the investor is interested in the most risk diversified
portfolio whose expected return is higher than the equal-weight
portfolio. This amounts to minimizing the largest CVaR contribution
subject to a return target and can be implemented as follows:

``` r
> obj <- function(w) \{
+   if(sum(w) == 0) \{ w <- w + 1e-2 \}
+   w <- w / sum(w)
+   contribCVaR <- ES(weights = w,
+     method = "gaussian",
+     portfolio_method = "component",
+     mu = mu,
+     sigma = sigma)\$contribution
+   tmp1 <- max(contribCVaR)
+   tmp2 <- max(mean(mu) - sum(w * mu), 0)
+   out <- tmp1 + 1e3 * tmp2
+ \}
> set.seed(1234)
> out <- DEoptim(fn = obj,
+   lower = rep(0, 5),
+   upper = rep(1, 5))
> wstar <- out\$optim\$bestmem
> wstar <- wstar / sum(wstar)
> rbind(tickers, round(100 * wstar, 2))
        par1    par2    par3    par4    par5
tickers "GE"    "IBM"   "JPM"   "MSFT"  "WMT"
        "17.38" "19.61" "14.85" "15.19" "32.98"
> 100 * (sum(wstar * mu) - mean(mu))
[1] 0.04150506
```

This portfolio invests more in the JPM stock and less in the GE (which
has the lowest average return) compared to the portfolio with the upper
22.5% percentage CVaR constraint. We refer to @BoudtCarlPeterson2010 for
a more elaborate study on using CVaR allocations as an objective
function or constraint in the portfolio optimization problem.

A classic risk/return (i.e., CVaR/mean) scatter chart showing the
results for portfolios tested by `DEoptim` is displayed in Figure
[3](#f:DEplot). Gray elements depict the results for all tested
portfolios (using hexagon binning which is a form of bivariate
histogram, see @hexbin; higher density regions are darker). The
yellow-red line shows the path of the best member of the population over
time, with the darkest solution at the end being the *optimal*
portfolio. We can notice how `DEoptim` does not spend much time
computing solutions in the scatter space that are suboptimal, but
concentrates the bulk of the calculation time in the vicinity of the
final *best* portfolio. Note that we are not looking for the tangency
portfolio; simple mean/CVaR optimization can be achieved with standard
optimizers. We are looking here for the best balance between return and
risk concentration.

![Figure 3: Risk/return scatter chart showing the results for portfolios
tested by DEoptim.](DEplot.png){#f:DEplot width="100%" alt="graphic without alt text"}

We have utilized the mean return/CVaR concentration examples here as
more realistic, but still stylized, examples of non-convex objectives
and constraints in portfolio optimization; other non-convex objectives,
such as drawdown minimization, are also common in real portfolios, and
are likewise suitable to application of Differential Evolution. One of
the key issues in practice with real portfolios is that a portfolio
manager rarely has only a single objective or only a few simple
objectives combined. For many combinations of objectives, there is no
unique global optimum, and the constraints and objectives formed lead to
a non-convex search space. It may take several hours on very fast
machines to get the best answers, and the best answers may not be a true
global optimum, they are just *as close as feasible* given potentially
competing and contradictory objectives.

When the constraints and objectives are relatively simple, and may be
reduced to quadratic, linear, or conical forms, a simpler optimization
solver will produce answers more quickly. When the objectives are more
layered, complex, and potentially contradictory, as those in real
portfolios tend to be, *DEoptim* or other global optimization algorithms
such as those integrated into *PortfolioAnalytics* provide a portfolio
manager with a feasible option for optimizing their portfolio under
real-world non-convex constraints and objectives.

The *PortfolioAnalytics* framework allows any arbitrary R function to be
part of the objective set, and allows the user to set the relative
weighting that they want on any specific objective, and use the
appropriately tuned optimization solver algorithm to locate portfolios
that most closely match those objectives.

# Summary

In this note we have introduced DE and *DEoptim*. The package *DEoptim*
provides a means of applying the DE algorithm in the R language and
environment for statistical computing. DE and the package *DEoptim* have
proven themselves to be powerful tools for the solution of global
optimization problems in a wide variety of fields. We have referred
interested users to [@PriceStornLampinen2006] and
@Antidisestablishmentarianism for a more extensive introduction, and
further pointers to the literature on DE. The utility of using *DEoptim*
was further demonstrated with a simple example of a stylized non-convex
portfolio risk contribution allocation, with users referred to
*PortfolioAnalytics* for portfolio optimization using DE with real
portfolios under non-convex constraints and objectives.

The latest version of the package includes the adaptive Differential
Evolution framework by @ZhangSanderson2009. Future work will also be
directed at parallelization of the implementation. The *DEoptim* project
is hosted on `R-forge` at
<https://r-forge.r-project.org/projects/deoptim/>.
