title: Differential Evolution with DEoptim
abstract: The R package DEoptim implements the Differential Evolution algorithm. This
  algorithm is an evolutionary technique similar to classic genetic algorithms that
  is useful for the solution of global optimization problems. In this note we provide
  an introduction to the package and demonstrate its utility for financial applications
  by solving a non-convex portfolio optimization problem.
