title: 'optimParallel: An R Package Providing a Parallel Version of the L-BFGS-B Optimization
  Method'
abstract: The R package optimParallel provides a parallel version of the L-BFGS-B
  optimization method of optim(). The main function of the package is optimParallel(),
  which has the same usage and output as optim(). Using optimParallel() can significantly
  reduce the optimization time, especially when the evaluation time of the objective
  function is large and no analytical gradient is available. We introduce the R package
  and illustrate its implementation, which takes advantage of the lexical scoping
  mechanism of R.
