title: 'optimParallel: An R Package Providing a Parallel Version of the L-BFGS-B Optimization
  Method'
abstract: The R package *optimParallel* provides a parallel version of the L-BFGS-B
  optimization method of `optim()`. The main function of the package is `optimParallel()`,
  which has the same usage and output as `optim()`. Using `optimParallel()` can significantly
  reduce the optimization time, especially when the evaluation time of the objective
  function is large and no analytical gradient is available. We introduce the R package
  and illustrate its implementation, which takes advantage of the lexical scoping
  mechanism of R.

# Introduction

Many statistical tools involve optimization algorithms, which aim to
find the minima or maxima of an objective function
$fn: \mathbb{R}^p \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$, where $p\in\mathbb{N}$
denotes the number of parameters. Depending on the specific application
different optimization algorithms may be preferred; see the book by
[@Nash:14], the special issue of the Journal of Statistical Software
[@jss:optim], and the CRAN Task View
[*Optimization*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/view=Optimization) for
overviews of the optimization software available for R. A widely used
algorithm is the limited-memory Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno
algorithm with box constraints [L-BFGS-B, @Byrd:etal:96], which is
available through the general-purpose optimizer `optim()` of the
R package *stats* and the more recent R packages
[*lbfgsb3*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=lbfgsb3) [@lbfgsb3] and
[*lbfgsb3c*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=lbfgsb3c) [@lbfgsb3c].
The L-BFGS-B algorithm has proven to work well in numerous applications.
However, long optimization times of computationally intensive functions
sometimes hinder its application; see [@Gerb:Mosi:Furr:16] for an
example of such a function from our research in spatial statistics. For
this reason we present a parallel version of the `optim()` L-BFGS-B
algorithm, denoted with `optimParallel()`, and explore its potential to
reduce optimization times.

To illustrate the possible speed gains of a parallel L-BFGS-B
implementation let $gr:\mathbb{R}^p \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^p$ denote the
gradient of $fn()$. L-BFGS-B always first evaluates $fn()$ and then
$gr()$ at the same parameter value and we call one such sequential
evaluation one *step*. Note that this step should not be confused with
the *iteration* as defined in @Byrd:etal:96 and used in the help page of
`optim()`, because the latter may involve several steps. Let $T_{fn}$
and $T_{gr}$ denote the evaluation times of $fn()$ and $gr()$,
respectively. In the case where $gr()$ is specified in the `optim()`
call, one step of the L-BFGS-B algorithm evaluates $fn()$ and $gr()$
sequentially, and hence, the evaluation time is little more than
$T_{fn}+T_{gr}$ per step. In contrast, `optimParallel()` evaluates both
functions in parallel, which reduces the evaluation time to little more
than $\max\{T_{fn},T_{gr}\}$ per step. In the case where no gradient is
provided, `optim()` calculates a numeric central difference gradient
approximation (CGA).

For $p=1$ the CGA is defined as
$$\widetilde{gr}(x)=(fn(x+\epsilon)-fn(x-\epsilon))\,/\,2\,\epsilon,$$
and hence, requires two evaluations of $fn()$. Similarly, calculating
$\widetilde{gr}()$ requires $2p$ evaluations of $fn()$ if $fn()$ has $p$
parameters. In total, `optim()` sequentially evaluates $fn()$  $1+2p$
times per step, resulting in an elapsed time of little more than
$(1+2p)T_{fn}$ per step. Given $1+2p$ available processor cores,
`optimParallel()` evaluates all calls of $fn()$ in parallel, which
reduces the elapsed time to little more than $T_{fn}$ per step.

# `optimParallel()` by examples

The main function of the R package
[*optimParallel*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=optimParallel)
[@optimParallel] is `optimParallel()`, which has the same usage and
output as `optim()`, but evaluates $fn()$ and $gr()$ in parallel. For
illustration, consider $10^7$ samples from a normal distribution with
mean $\mu=5$ and standard deviation $\sigma=2$. Then, we define the
following negative log-likelihood and use `optim()` to estimate the
parameters $\mu$ and $\sigma$:[^1]

``` r
> x <- rnorm(n = 1e7, mean = 5, sd = 2)
> negll <- function(par, x) -sum(dnorm(x = x, mean = par[1], sd = par[2], log = TRUE))
> o1 <- optim(par = c(1, 1), fn = negll, x = x, method = "L-BFGS-B",
+             lower = c(-Inf, 0.0001))
> o1$par
[1] 5.000597 2.000038
```

Using `optimParallel()`, we can do the same in parallel. The functions
`makeCluster()`, `detectCores()`, and `setDefaultCluster()` from the
R package *parallel* are used to set up a default cluster for the
parallel execution.

``` r
> install.packages("optimParallel")
> library("optimParallel")
Loading required package: parallel
> cl <- makeCluster(detectCores()); setDefaultCluster(cl = cl)
> o2 <- optimParallel(par = c(1, 1), fn = negll, x = x, lower = c(-Inf, 0.0001))
> identical(o1, o2)
[1] TRUE
```

On our computer with 12 Intel Xeon E5-2640 @ 2.50GHz processors one
evaluation of `negll()` took $0.9$ seconds. `optim()` run with $6.2$
seconds per step, whereas `optimParallel()` run with $1.8$ seconds per
step. Thus, the optimization time of `optimParallel()` is reduced by
$71\%$ compared to that of `optim()`. Note that for $p=2$,  $71\%$ is
below the maximal possible reduction of $1-1/(2p+1)=80\%$ because of the
overhead associated with the parallel execution and the time needed to
run the L-BFGS-B algorithm, which are both not taken into account in
this calculation. In general, the reduction of the optimization time is
large if the parallel overhead is small relative to the execution time
of $fn()$. Hence, for this example, the reduction of the optimization
time approaches $80\%$ when the evaluation time of `negll()` is
increased, e. g., by increasing the number of data points in `x`.

In addition to the arguments of `optim()`, `optimParallel()` has the
argument `parallel`, which takes a list of arguments. For example, we
can set `parallel = list(loginfo = TRUE)` to store all evaluated
parameters and the corresponding gradients.

``` r
> o3 <- optimParallel(par = c(1, 1), fn = negll, x = x, lower = c(-Inf, 0.0001),
+                     parallel = list(loginfo = TRUE))
> head(o3$loginfo, n = 3)
     step     par1     par2        fn       gr1        gr2
[1,]    1 1.000000 1.000000 109213991 -40005963 -190049608
[2,]    2 1.205988 1.978554  39513324  -9693283  -18700810
[3,]    3 1.265626 2.086455  37160791  -8579638  -14969646
> tail(o3$loginfo, n = 3)
      step     par1     par2       fn         gr1       gr2
[16,]   16 5.000840 2.000140 21121045 609.9480540 507.56421
[17,]   17 5.000586 2.000041 21121045 -26.8237162  15.17266
[18,]   18 5.000597 2.000038 21121045   0.6494038  -1.67717
```

This can be used to visualize the optimization path as shown in
Figure [1](#fig:path) and simplifies the following study, which
illustrates the impact of using different (approximate) gradient
specifications.

information obtained with
`optimParallel(..., parallel = list(loginfo = TRUE))`. The red lines

width="100%" alt="graphic without alt text"}

In the `optimParallel()` calls above the argument `gr` was not
specified, and hence, the CGA was used. Another way of using
`optimParallel()` is with a gradient function given to the
argument `gr`. If the computation of the analytical gradient is
tractable and does not take more time than evaluating $fn()$, this usage
is preferred.

``` r
> negll_gr <- function(par, x){
+     sm <- mean(x); n <- length(x)
+     c(-n*(sm-par[1])/par[2]^2,
+       n/par[2] - (sum((x-sm)^2) + n*(sm-par[1])^2)/par[2]^3)
+ }
> o4 <- optimParallel(par = c(1, 1), fn = negll, gr = negll_gr, x = x,
+                     lower = c(-Inf, 0.0001), parallel = list(loginfo = TRUE))
> tail(o4$loginfo, n = 3)
      step     par1     par2       fn         gr1        gr2
[16,]   16 5.000840 2.000139 21121045 609.9651113 507.625076
[17,]   17 5.000586 2.000041 21121045 -26.8233339  15.172072
[18,]   18 5.000597 2.000037 21121045   0.6494452  -1.677113
```

We see that the resulting optimization path is very similar to that
based on the CGA (`o3` above).

Besides the CGA and the option to explicitly specify a gradient
function, `optimParallel()` provides a third option, namely the numeric
forward difference gradient approximation (FGA) defined as
$\widetilde{gr}(x)=(fn(x+\epsilon)-fn(x))/\epsilon\,$ for $p=1$ and $x$
sufficiently away from the boundaries. Using the FGA, the return value
of $fn(x)$ can be reused for the computation of the gradient, and hence,
the number of evaluations of $fn()$ is reduced to $1+p$ per step. This
can be helpful if the number of available cores is less than $1+2p$ or
insufficient memory is available to run $1+2p$ evaluations of $fn()$ in
parallel.

``` r
> o5 <- optimParallel(par = c(1, 1), fn = negll, x = x, lower = c(-Inf, 0.0001),
+                     parallel = list(loginfo = TRUE, forward = TRUE))
> o5$loginfo[17:19, ]
     step     par1     par2       fn       gr1       gr2
[1,]   17 5.000086 1.999541 21121046 -26.33029  14.35781
[2,]   18 5.000331 1.999645 21121045 586.89953 534.85303
[3,]   19 5.000346 1.999651 21121045 625.10421 567.27441
```



``` r
> tail(o5$loginfo, n = 3)
      step     par1     par2       fn      gr1      gr2
[31,]   31 5.000347 1.999652 21121045 627.8436 569.5991
[32,]   32 5.000347 1.999652 21121045 627.8436 569.5991
[33,]   33 5.000347 1.999652 21121045 627.8436 569.5991
```

We see that the optimizer only stopped after $33$ steps, whereas all
previous optimization calls stopped after $18$ steps. Hence, it is
obvious that the choice of the gradient approximation affects the
optimization. But what happened exactly?--- It should be noted that the
FGA is less accurate than the CGA; see, e. g., the numerical study in
@Nash:14, Section 10.7. Hence, small differences in the optimization
path are expected, but this does hardly explain the additional
$15$ steps used by the FGA based optimization. A closer inspection of
the optimization path reveals that up to step 18 the path is very
similar to those of the previous optimization calls and the remaining
steps 19--33 only marginally change `par1` and `par2`. This suggests
that using the FGA prevents the algorithm from stopping. One way to
handle this issue is to set a less restrictive stopping criterion by
increasing the value of `factr`.

``` r
> o6 <- optimParallel(par = c(1, 1), fn = negll, x = x, lower = c(-Inf, 0.0001),
+                     parallel = list(loginfo = TRUE, forward = TRUE),
+                     control = list(factr = 1e-6/.Machine$double.eps))
> tail(o6$loginfo, n = 3)
      step     par1     par2       fn        gr1        gr2
[14,]   14 4.996680 2.001974 21121074 -8524.7678 12125.5022
[15,]   15 4.999743 1.998478 21121052  -884.4955 -5305.2516
[16,]   16 5.000347 1.999652 21121045   627.8436   569.5991
```

Now the resulting optimization path and the evaluation counts are
similar to those resulting from the optimization using the analytic
gradient (`o4` above). The take-home message of this study is that the
choice of the (approximate) gradient can affect the optimization path
and it may be necessary to adjust control parameters such as `factr`,
`ndeps`, and `parscale` to obtain satisfactory results. A more detailed
discussion of the use of (approximate) gradients in optimization can be
found in @Nash:14, Chapter 10.

# Implementation

`optimParallel()` is a wrapper to `optim()` and enables the parallel
evaluation of all function calls involved in one step of the L-BFGS-B
optimization method. It is implemented in R and interfaces compiled
C code only through `optim()`. The reuse of the stable and well-tested
C code of `optim()` has the advantage that `optimParallel()` leads to
the exact same results as `optim()`. To ensure that `optimParallel()`
and `optim()` indeed return the same results *optimParallel* contains
systematic unit tests implemented with the R package
[*testthat*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=testthat)
[@testthat; @Hadl:11].

The basic idea of the implementation is that calling `fn()` (or `gr()`)
triggers the evaluation of both `fn()` and `gr()`. Their return values
are stored in a local environment. The next time `fn()` (or `gr()`) is
called with the same parameters the results are read from the local
environment without evaluating `fn()` and `gr()` again. The following R
code illustrates how `optimParallel()` takes advantage of the lexical
scoping mechanism of R to store the return values of `fn()` and `gr()`.

``` r
> demo_generator <- function(fn, gr) {
+     par_last <- value <- grad <- NA
+     eval <- function(par) {
+         if(!identical(par, par_last)) {
+             message("--> evaluate fn() and gr()")
+             par_last <<- par
+             value <<- fn(par)
+             grad <<- gr(par)
+         } else
+             message("--> read stored value")
+     }
+     f <- function(par) {
+         eval(par = par)
+         value
+     }
+     g <- function(par) {
+         eval(par = par)
+         grad
+     }
+     list(fn = f, gr = g)
+ }
> demo <- demo_generator(fn = sum, gr = prod)
```

Calling `demo$fn()` triggers the evaluation of both `fn()` and `gr()`.

``` r
> demo$fn(1:5)
--> evaluate fn() and gr()
[1] 15
```

The subsequent call of `demo$gr()` with the same parameters returns the
stored value `grad` without evaluating `gr()` again.

``` r
> demo$gr(1:5)
--> read stored value
[1] 120
```

A similar construct allows `optimParallel()` to evaluate $fn()$ and
$gr()$ at the same occasion. It is then straightforward to parallelize
the evaluations of the functions using the R package *parallel*.

# Speed gains and performance test

To illustrate the speed gains that can be achieved with
`optimParallel()` we measure the elapsed times per step when optimizing
the following test function and compare them to those of `optim()`.

``` r
> fn <- function(par, sleep) {
+     Sys.sleep(sleep)
+     sum(par^2)
+ }
> gr <- function(par, sleep) {
+     Sys.sleep(sleep)
+     2*par
+ }
```

In both functions the argument `par` can be a numeric vector with one or
more elements and the argument `sleep` controls the evaluation time of
the functions. We measure the elapsed time per step using all
combinations of $p=1$, $2$, $3$, `sleep =` $0$, $0.05$, $0.2$, $0.4$,
$0.6$, $0.8$, $1$ seconds with and without analytic gradient `gr()`. All
measurements are taken on a computer with $12$ Intel Xeon
E5-2640 @ 2.50GHz processors. However, because of the experimental
design a maximum of $7$ processors are used in parallel. We repeat each
measurement $5$ times using the R package
[*microbenchmark*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=microbenchmark)
[@microbenchmark]. The complete R script of the benchmark experiment is
contained in *optimParallel*.

![Figure 2: Benchmark experiment comparing the L-BFGS-B method from
`optimParallel()` and `optim()`. Plotted are the elapsed times per step
($y$-axis) and the evaluation time of $fn()$ ($x$-axis) for $p=1,\,2,$
and $3$ using an approximate gradient and $p=3$ using an analytic
gradient. The elapsed times of `optimParallel()` (solid line) are
independent of $p$ and the specification of an analytic gradient.
](benchmark.png){#fig:bench width="100%" alt="graphic without alt text"}

The results of the benchmark experiment are summarized in
Figure [2](#fig:bench). They show that for `optimParallel()` the elapsed
time per step is only marginally larger than $T_{fn}$ (black circles in
Figure [2](#fig:bench)). Conversely, the elapsed time for `optim()` is
$T_{fn}+T_{gr}$ if a gradient function is specified (violet circles) and
$(1+2p)T_{fn}$ if no gradient function is specified (red, green, and
blue circles). Moreover, `optimParallel()` adds a small overhead, and
hence, it is only faster than `optim()` for $T_{fn}$ larger than
$0.05$ seconds.

The use of `Sys.sleep()` in this illustration is useful to characterize
the implementation and its overhead. However, it does not represent a
practical use case of `optimParallel()` and the speed gains might be
less pronounced for other examples. One factor that reduces the speed of
`optimParallel()` is the specification of large objects in its `"..."`
argument. All those objects are copied to the running R sessions in the
cluster, which increases the elapsed time. Related to that is the
increased memory usage, which may slowdown the optimization when not
enough memory is available.

# Summary

The R package *optimParallel* provides a parallel version of the
L-BFGS-B optimization method of `optim()`. After a brief theoretical
illustration of the possible speed improvement based on parallel
processing, we illustrate `optimParallel()` by examples. The examples
demonstrate that one can replace `optim()` by `optimParallel()` to
execute the optimization in parallel and illustrate additional features
like capturing log information and using different (approximate)
gradients. Moreover, we briefly sketch the basic idea of the
implementation, which is based on the lexical scoping mechanism of R.
Finally, a performance test shows that using `optimParallel()` reduces
the elapsed time to optimize computationally demanding functions
significantly. For functions with evaluation times of more than
$0.1$ seconds we measured speed gains of about factor $2$ in the case
where an analytic gradient was specified and about factor $1+2p$
otherwise ($p$ is the number of parameters). Our results suggest that
using `optimParallel()` is most beneficial when (i) the evaluation time
of $fn()$ is large (more than $0.1$ seconds), (ii) no analytical
gradient is available, and (iii) $p$ or more processors as well as
enough memory are available.

    $\sigma$. Moreover, a computationally more efficient version of
    `negll()` can be constructed based on `mean()` and `sd()`.
