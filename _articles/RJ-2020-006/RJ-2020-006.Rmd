title: 'SortedEffects: Sorted Causal Effects in R'
abstract: Chernozhukov et al. (2018) proposed the sorted effect method for nonlinear
  regression models. This method consists of reporting percentiles of the partial
  effects, the sorted effects, in addition to the average effect commonly used to
  summarize the heterogeneity in the partial effects. They also propose to use the
  sorted effects to carry out classification analysis where the observational units
  are classified as most and least affected if their partial effect are above or below
  some tail sorted effects. The R package SortedEffects implements the estimation
  and inference methods therein and provides tools to visualize the results. This
  vignette serves as an introduction to the package and displays basic functionality
  of the functions within.
