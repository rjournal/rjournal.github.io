title: Tidy Data Neatly Resolves Mass-Spectrometry's Ragged Arrays
abstract: ' Mass spectrometry (MS) is a powerful tool for measuring biomolecules,
  but the data produced is often difficult to handle computationally because it is
  stored as a ragged array. In R, this format is typically encoded in complex S4 objects
  built around environments, requiring an extensive background in R to perform even
  simple tasks. However, the adoption of tidy data [@wickham2014] provides an alternate
  data structure that is highly intuitive and works neatly with base R functions and
  common packages, as well as other programming languages. Here, we discuss the current
  state of R-based MS data processing, the convenience and challenges of integrating
  tidy data techniques into MS data processing, and present [RaMS](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=RaMS),
  a package that produces tidy representations of MS data. '
