title: 'PASSED: Calculate Power and Sample Size for Two Sample Tests'
abstract: Power and sample size estimation are critical aspects of study design to
  demonstrate minimized risk for subjects and justify the allocation of time, money,
  and other resources. Researchers often work with response variables that take the
  form of various distributions. Here, we present an R package, PASSED, that allows
  flexibility with seven common distributions and multiple options to accommodate
  sample size or power analysis. The relevant statistical theory, calculations, and
  examples for each distribution using PASSED are discussed in this paper.
