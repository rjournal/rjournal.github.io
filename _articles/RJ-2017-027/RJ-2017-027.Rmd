title: 'The NoiseFiltersR Package: Label Noise Preprocessing in R'
abstract: In Data Mining, the value of extracted knowledge is directly related to
  the quality of the used data. This makes data preprocessing one of the most important
  steps in the knowledge discovery process. A common problem affecting data quality
  is the presence of noise. A training set with label noise can reduce the predictive
  performance of classification learning techniques and increase the overfitting of
  classification models. In this work we present the NoiseFiltersR package. It contains
  the first extensive R implementation of classical and state-of-the-art label noise
  filters, which are the most common techniques for preprocessing label noise. The
  algorithms used for the implementation of the label noise filters are appropriately
  documented and referenced. They can be called in a R-user-friendly manner, and their
  results are unified by means of the "filter" class, which also benefits from adapted
  print and summary methods.
