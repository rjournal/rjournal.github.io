title: 'maxent: An R Package for Low-memory Multinomial Logistic Regression with Support
  for Semi-automated Text Classification'
abstract: maxent is a package with tools for data classification using multinomial
  logistic regression, also known as maximum entropy. The focus of this maximum entropy
  classifier is to minimize memory consumption on very large datasets, particularly
  sparse document-term matrices represented by the tm text mining package.
