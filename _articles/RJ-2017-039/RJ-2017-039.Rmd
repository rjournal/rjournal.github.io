title: 'anomalyDetection: Implementation of Augmented Network Log Anomaly Detection
  Procedures'
abstract: As the number of cyber-attacks continues to grow on a daily basis, so does
  the delay in threat detection. For instance, in 2015, the Office of Personnel Management
  discovered that approximately 21.5 million individual records of Federal employees
  and contractors had been stolen. On average, the time between an attack and its
  discovery is more than 200 days. In the case of the OPM breach, the attack had been
  going on for almost a year. Currently, cyber analysts inspect numerous potential
  incidents on a daily basis, but have neither the time nor the resources available
  to perform such a task. *anomalyDetection* aims to curtail the time frame in which
  anomalous cyber activities go unnoticed and to aid in the efficient discovery of
  these anomalous transactions among the millions of daily logged events by i) providing
  an efficient means for pre-processing and aggregating cyber data for analysis by
  employing a tabular vector transformation and handling multicollinearity concerns;
  ii) offering numerous built-in multivariate statistical functions such as Mahalanobis
  distance, factor analysis, principal components analysis to identify anomalous activity,
  iii) incorporating the pipe operator (`%>%`) to allow it to work well in the *tidyverse*
  workflow. Combined, *anomalyDetection* offers cyber analysts an efficient and simplified
  approach to break up network events into time-segment blocks and identify periods
  associated with suspected anomalies for further evaluation.

## Introduction

Organizations worldwide rely heavily on the systems of cyberspace, and
the wider Internet as a whole, for commerce, defense operations,
infrastructure control systems, financial management, transportation,
and other critical services. Unfortunately, the number of cyber-attacks
are growing on a daily basis and the ability of organizations to spot
anomalous cyber activitiy is becoming more and more delayed
[@guti2016anomaly]. On average, the time between an attack and its
discovery is more than 200 days [@koerner2017inside]. In the case of the
2015 Office of Personnel Management breach, in which approximately 21.5
million individual records of Federal employees and contractors had been
stolen, the attack had been going on for almost a year prior to the
anomalous activity being identified [@opmcyber].

Cyber analysts inspect numerous potential incidents on a daily basis,
but lack the time and resources to scour the high volumes of data in an
efficient manner to identify anomalous activity worth further
investigation [@sam2016using]. Firewalls and intrusion detection and
prevention systems (IDPS) are one line of defense in identifying and
stopping suspicious internet traffic. When a suspicious event occurs,
these devices generate a log file containing details of what
preprogrammed rules were violated and how it was handled
[@goodall2009developing]. Such log files contain details of the event,
(i.e. source and destination IP addresses, port numbers, and protocols),
but not the packet and data that led to the event. A primary activity of
cyber analysts is the analysis of these log files to detect anomalies
[@guti2016anomaly]. Although a reduced form of anomalous cyber data,
these data sets can still represent millions of cyberspace transactions
per minute [@jayathilake2012towards]. Unfortunately, analysis of these
log files has, historically, been heavily manual in nature and often
leverages subject matter expertise to find possible threats in logged
events to further investigate
[@goodall2009developing; @jayathilake2012towards; @sam2016using]. This
approach is inefficient and can suffer from biased, subjective
assessments [@zamani2013machine]. Moreover, much of the related research
has focused on anomaly detection at the device/software level [i.e.
@lazarevic2003comparative; @denning1987intrusion; @garcia2009anomaly],
with little exploration into anomaly detection in the log files
generated from the preexisting devices or software [i.e
@mcdonald2012design; @winding2006system; @breier2015anomaly].
Consequently, efficient analytic approaches are desirable to help detect
anomalous activity in cyber network log data [@guti2016anomaly].

This research introduces the
[*anomalyDetection*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=anomalyDetection)
package [@anomaly2017pkg] to provide cyber analysts efficient means for
performing anomaly detection in log files. The purpose of the package is
to make *identifying* abnormal activity more efficient so that cyber
analysts can spend more time researching the potential threat. It is
important to note that there is no guarantee that anomalous activity is
evidence of malicious cyber activity; however, identification of
anomalous activity provides cyber security experts a starting point in
their search for undetected malicious activity. *anomalyDetection*
simplifies this process.

This paper proceeds as follows. First, we introduce the
*anomalyDetection* functions and the `security_logs` data set that will
be leveraged for the illustrative examples. Next, we demonstrate how
*anomalyDetection* can pre-process a data set for follow on analysis.
This includes converting a data set with non-numeric attributes into
numeric data using a tabulated state vector approach. *anomalyDetection*
further prepares this tabulated state vector by inspecting and
correcting for multicollinearity. We then illustrate how
*anomalyDetection* provides efficient multivariate statistical analysis
processes to help identify anomalous activity. Last, we end with some
concluding remarks.

## *anomalyDetection* functions {#functions}

*anomalyDetection* provides 13 functions to aid in the detection of
potential cyber anomalies, which are listed in Table 1. The package also
incorporates the pipe operator (`%>%`) from the
[*magrittr*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=magrittr) package
[@magrittr2014] for streamlining function composition. To illustrate the
functionality of *anomalyDetection* we will use the `security_logs` data
that mimics common information that appears in security logs and comes
with *anomalyDetection*. Note that we also load the
[*tidyverse*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=tidyverse) package
[@tidy2017verse] for common manipulation and visualization tasks.

## Data pre-processing

In order to develop a statistical framework for firewall log analysis,
data pre-processing is necessary prior to applying any multivariate
analytic techniques. To assist in this process *anomalyDetection* offers
two main approaches to pre-process log file data - aggregating the data
into a tabulated state vector and managing multicollinearity concerns.

First, we can employ the tabulated vector approach introduced by
[@guti2016anomaly]. This approach transforms the security log data into
unique counts of data attributes based on pre-defined time blocks.
Therefore, as each time block is generated, the categorical fields are
separated by their levels and a count of occurrences for each level are
recorded into a vector. All numerical fields, such as bytes in and bytes
out, are recorded as a summation within the time block. The result is
what we call a state vector matrix.

Thus, for our `security_logs` data we can create our state vector matrix
based on our data being divided into 10 time blocks. What results is the
summary of instances for each categorical level in our data for each
time block. Consequently, row one represents the first time block and
there were 2 instances of CISCO as the device vendor, 1 instance of IBM,
etc. By adjusting the `block_length`, `level_limit`, and `level_keep`
arguments, the user can refine the level of aggregation and variables to
retain and analyze.

```

The state vector matrix provides us with a numerical construct to
analyze our log file data; however, prior to proceeding with any
multivariate statistical analyses we should inspect the state vector for
multicollinearity, to avoid issues such as matrix singularity, rank
deficiency, and strong correlation values, and remove any columns that
pose an issue. We can use `mc_adjust()` to handle issues with
multicollinearity by first removing any columns whose variance is close
to or less than a minimum level of variance (`min_var`). Then, it
removes linearly dependent columns. Finally, it removes any columns that
have a high absolute correlation value equal to or greater than that
defined by the user (`max_cor`).

``` r
(state_vec <- security_logs %>%
  tabulate_state_vector(10) %>%
  mc_adjust())
# A tibble: 30 × 26
#   CISCO   IBM Juniper McAfee `Palo Alto Networks`   ePO Attempt Failure

# 2      0     2       4      2                    2     2       4       2

# 5      3     1       1      3                    2     1       3       3
# 6      2     1       2      4                    1     1       4       1
# 7      2     2       1      3                    2     0       3       3
# 8      3     3       1      3                    0     2       6       2
# 9      0     1       4      3                    2     1       4       4
# 10     2     2       2      4                    0     3       3       0
# ... with 20 more rows, and 18 more variables: `174.110.206.174` <int>,
#   `223.70.128.61` <int>, `227.12.127.87` <int>, `28.9.24.154` <int>,
#   `145.114.4.203` <int>, `151.194.233.198` <int>, `219.142.109.8` <int>,
#   `32.73.26.223` <int>, TCP <int>, China <int>, India <int>,
#   Korea <int>, Netherlands <int>, Russia <int>, `United Kingdom` <int>,
#   Src_Port <int>, Dst_Port <int>, Bytes_TRF <int>
```

By default, `mc_adjust()` removes *all* columns that violate the
variance, dependency, and correlation thresholds. Alternatively, we can
use `action = "select"` as an argument, which provides interactivity
where the user can select the variables that violate the correlation
threshold that they would like to remove.

## Multivariate statistical analyses

With our data adjusted for multicollinearity we can now proceed with
multivariate analyses to identify anomalies in our log file. First we'll
use the `mahalanobis_distance()` function to compare the distance
between each observation by its distance from the data mean, independent
of scale. This is computed as

$$MD = \sqrt{(x - \bar{x})C^{-1}(x-\bar{x})} \tag{1}$$

where $x$ is a vector of $p$ observations, $x=(x_1, \dots, x_p)$,
$\bar{x}$ is the mean vector of the data,
$\bar{x}=(\bar{x}_1, \dots, \bar{x}_p)$, and $C^{-1}$ is the inverse
data covariance matrix. Here, we include `output = "both"` to return
both the Mahalanobis distance and the absolute breakdown distances and
`normalize = TRUE` so that we can compare relative magnitudes across our
data.

``` r
state_vec %>%
  mahalanobis_distance("both", normalize = TRUE) %>%
  as_tibble

```

We can use this information in a modified heatmap visualization
(Figure 1) to identify outlier values across our security log attributes
and time blocks. Brighter columns represent time blocks deserving
greater attention and further investigation. Larger circles represent
variables within a time block that have more anomalous activity. Thus,
the larger and brighter the dot the more significant the outlier is and
the more it deserves attention.

``` r
state_vec %>%
  mahalanobis_distance("both", normalize = TRUE) %>%
  as_tibble %>%
  dplyr::mutate(Block = 1:n()) %>% 
  gather(Variable, BD, -c(MD, Block)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(factor(Block), Variable, color = MD, size = BD)) +
  geom_point()
```

![Figure 1: Modified heatmap for time block and feature outlier
detection.](heatmap.png){width="100%" alt="graphic without alt text"}

We can build onto this with the `bd_row()` function to identify which
security log attributes in the data are driving the Mahalanobis
distance. `bd_row()` measures the relative contribution of each
variable, $x_i$, to $MD$ by computing

$$BD_i = \Bigg|\frac{x_i - \bar{x}_i}{\sqrt{C_{ii}}} \Bigg| \tag{2}$$

where $C_{ii}$ is the variance of $x_i$. Furthermore, `bd_row()` will
look at a specified row and rank-order the columns by those that are
driving the Mahalanobis distance. For example, the plot above identified
block 17 as having the largest Mahalanobis distance suggesting some
abnormal activity may be occurring during that time block. We can drill
down into that block and look at the top 10 security log attributes that
are driving the Mahalanobis distance as these may be areas that require
further investigation.

``` r
state_vec %>%
  mahalanobis_distance("bd", normalize = TRUE) %>%

Next, we can use factor analysis as a dimensionality reduction technique
to identify the underlying structure of the data and identify factors
(features) in the data that appear abnormal. Factor analysis relates the
correlations between variables through a set of factors to link together
seemingly unrelated variables. The basic factor analysis model is

$$X= \Lambda f+e \tag{3}$$

where $X$ is the vector of responses $X = (x_1, \dots, x_p)$, $f$ are
the common factors $f = (f_1, \dots, f_q)$, $e$ is the unique factors
$e = (e_1, \dots, e_p)$, and $\Lambda$ is the factor loadings. Factor
loadings are correlations between the factors and the original data and
can thus range from -1 to 1, which indicate how much that factor affects
each variable. Values close to 0 imply a weak effect on the variable.
For the desired results, *anomalyDetection* uses the correlation matrix
in its factor analysis computation.

A factor loadings matrix can be computed to understand how each original
data variable is related to the resultant factors. This can be computed
as

$$\Lambda = \bigg[\sqrt{\lambda_1}*e_1, \dots, \sqrt{\lambda_p}*e_p \bigg] \tag{4}$$

where $\lambda_1$ is the eigenvalue for each factor, $e_i$ is the
eigenvector for each factor, and $p$ is the number of columns. Factor
scores are used to examine the behavior of the observations relative to
each factor and can be used to identify anomaly detection. Factor scores
are calculated as

$$\hat f = X_s R^{-1} \Lambda  \tag{5}$$

where $X_s$ is the standardized observations, $R^{-1}$ is the inverse of
the correlation matrix, and $\Lambda$ is the factor loadings matrix. To
simplify the results for interpretation, the factor loadings can undergo
an orthogonal or oblique rotation. Orthogonal rotations assume
independence between the factors while oblique rotations allow the
factors to correlate. *anomalyDetection* utilizes the most common
rotation option known as varimax. Varimax rotates the factors
orthogonally to maximize the variance of the squared factor loadings
which forces large factors to increase and small ones to decrease,
providing easier interpretation.

To begin using factor analysis, the dimensions of the reduced state
vector matrix are first passed to `horns_curve()`, which computes Horn's
Parallel Analysis [@horn1965rationale] to determine the factors to
retain within a factor analysis.

``` r
horns_curve(state_vec)
# [1] 3.421431145 2.920860390 2.562571534 2.260732869 2.007756392
# [6] 1.789346403 1.595986779 1.418585893 1.255915765 1.106646364
# [11] 0.968567809 0.844067782 0.730563435 0.628690131 0.534405206
# [16] 0.450673920 0.374269067 0.306115502 0.244354685 0.191335630
# [21] 0.144295808 0.103873773 0.070143272 0.043042783 0.022553583
# [26] 0.008092665
```

Next, the dimensionality is determined by finding the eigenvalues of the
correlation matrix of the state vector matrix and retaining only those
factors whose eigenvalues are greater than or equal to those produced by
`horns_curve()`. We use `factor_analysis()` to reduce the state vector
matrix into resultant factors. The `factor_analysis()` function
generates a list containing five outputs:

`$fa_loadings`

:   numerical matrix with the original factor loadings

`$fa_scores`

:   numerical matrix with the row scores for each factor

`$fa_loadings_rotated`

:   numerical matrix with the varimax rotated factor loadings

`$fa_scores_rotated`

:   numerical matrix with the row scores for each varimax rotated factor

`$num_factors`

:   : numeric vector identifying the number of factors

``` r
state_vec %>%
  horns_curve() %>%
  factor_analysis(state_vec, hc_points = .) %>%
  names()
# [1] "fa_loadings"         "fa_scores"           "fa_loadings_rotated"
# [4] "fa_scores_rotated"   "num_factors"
```

For easy access to these results we can use the
`factor_analysis_results()` parsing function. The
`factor_analysis_results()` function will parse the results either by
their list name or by location. For instance to extract the rotated
factor scores you can use
`factor_analysis_results(data, results = fa_scores_rotated)` or
`factor_analysis_results(data, results = 4)` as demonstrated below.

``` r
state_vec %>%
  horns_curve() %>%
  factor_analysis(state_vec, hc_points = .) %>%
  factor_analysis_results(4) %>%
  as_tibble

To evaluate the quality of a factor analysis solution, Kaiser
[@kaiser1974index] proposed the Index of Factorial Simplicity (IFS). The
IFS is computed as

$$IFS = \frac{\sum_i\big[q \sum_s \lambda_{js}^4-(\sum_s \lambda_{js}^2)^2\big]}{\sum_i\big[(q-1)(\sum_s \lambda_{js}^2)^2 \big]} \tag{6}$$

where $q$ is the number of factors, $j$ the row index, $s$ the column
index, and $\lambda_{js}$ is the value in the loadings matrix.
Furthermore, Kaiser created the following evaluations of the score
produced by the IFS as shown below:

In the .90s

:   Marvelous

In the .80s

:   Meritorious

In the .70s

:   Middling

In the .60s

:   Mediocre

In the .50s

:   Miserable

Less than .50

:   : Unacceptable

Thus, to assess the quality of our factor analysis results we apply
`kaisers_index()` to the rotated factor loadings and, as the results
show below, our output value of $0.702$ suggests that our results are
"middling".

``` r
state_vec %>%
  horns_curve() %>%
  factor_analysis(data = state_vec, hc_points = .) %>%
  factor_analysis_results(fa_loadings_rotated) %>%
  kaisers_index()
# [1] 0.7018006
```

Furthermore, Figure 2 visualizes the factor analysis results to show the
correlation between the columns of the reduced state vector to the
rotated factor loadings. Strong negative correlations are depicted as
red while strong positive correlations are shown as blue. This helps to
identify which factors are correlated with each security log data
attribute. Furthermore, this helps to identify two or more security log
data attributes that appear to have relationships with their
occurrences. For example, this shows that Russia is highly correlated
with IP address `223.70.128` since both these attributes are strongly
correlated with factor 5. If there is an abnormally large amount of
instances with Russian occurrences this would be the logical IP address
to start investigating.

``` r
fa_loadings <- state_vec %>%
  horns_curve() %>%
  factor_analysis(state_vec, hc_points = .) %>%
  factor_analysis_results(fa_loadings_rotated)

row.names(fa_loadings) <- colnames(state_vec)

gplots::heatmap.2(fa_loadings, dendrogram = 'both', trace = 'none', 
            density.info = 'none', breaks = seq(-1, 1, by = .25), 
            col = RColorBrewer::brewer.pal(8, 'RdBu'))
```

attributes.](figure2.png){width="100%" alt="graphic without alt text"}

We can also visualize the rotated factor score plots as in Figure 3 to
see which time blocks appear to be outliers and deserve closer
attention.

``` r
state_vec %>%
  horns_curve() %>%
  factor_analysis(state_vec, hc_points = .) %>%
  factor_analysis_results(fa_scores_rotated) %>%
  as_tibble() %>%
  dplyr::mutate(Block = 1:n()) %>%
  gather(Factor, Score, -Block) %>%
  dplyr::mutate(Absolute_Score = abs(Score)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(Factor, Absolute_Score, label = Block)) +
  geom_text(size = 2) +
  geom_boxplot(outlier.shape = NA)
```

![Figure 3: Detecting outlier time blocks based on rotated factor
analysis scores.](outliers.png){width="100%" alt="graphic without alt text"}

This allows us to look across the factors and identify outlier blocks
that may require further intra-block analysis. If we assume that an
absolute rotated factor score $\geq 2$ represents our outlier cut-off
then we see that time blocks 4, 13, 15, 17, 24, 26, and 27 require
further investigation. We saw block 17 being highlighted with
`mahalanobis_distance()` earlier, but these other time blocks were not
as obvious, so by performing and comparing these multiple anomaly
detection approaches we can gain greater insights or confirm prior
suspicions.

An alternative, yet similar approach to factor analysis is principal
component analysis. These two approaches can produce similar outcomes,
especially when the error component in equation 4 is close to zero
[@fabrigar1999evaluating]. However, the results often differ and there
are important distinctions in the interpretation of these results
[@park2002use]. First, a primary difference between the two approaches
is that factor analysis estimates errors while principal component
analysis does not. This indicates that principal component analysis
assumes that the measurement is without error. Second, the goal in
factor analysis is to explain the covariances or correlations between
the variables. Therefore anomaly detection using factor analysis will
identify time blocks and variable attributes in which their abnormal
behavior is highly correlated to one another. This allows you to
identify latent features in the data. By contrast, the goal of principal
component analysis is to explain as much of the total variance in the
variables as possible. Therefore, if your goal is to reduce the log file
variables into a composite component for further analysis, principal
component analysis would be appropriate. To maintain clarity between
these two approaches the following discussion leverages different
notation.

The first principal component of a set of features $X_1, X_2,\dots,X_p$
is the normalized linear combination of the features

$$Z_1 = \phi_{11}X_1 + \phi_{21}X_2 + \cdots + \phi_{p1}X_p \tag{7}$$

that has the largest variance. By normalized, we mean that
$\sum^p_{j=1} \phi^2_{j1} = 1$. We refer to the elements
$\phi_{11},\dots,\phi_{p1}$ as the loadings of the first principal
component; together, the loadings make up the principal component
loading vector, $\phi_1 = (\phi_{11}, \phi_{21}, \dots, \phi_{p1})^T$.
The loadings are constrained so that their sum of squares is equal to
one, since otherwise setting these elements to be arbitrarily large in
absolute value could result in an arbitrarily large variance. After the
first principal component $Z_1$ of the features has been determined, we
can find the second principal component $Z_2$. The second principal
component is the linear combination of $X_1,\dots,X_p$ that has maximal
variance out of all linear combinations that are uncorrelated with
$Z_1$. The second principal component scores
$z_{12}, z_{22},\dots,z_{n2}$ take the form

$$z_{12} = \phi_{12}x_{i1} + \phi_{22}x_{i2} + \cdots + \phi_{p2}x_{ip} \tag{8}$$

where $\phi_2$ is the second principal loading vector, with elements
$\phi_{12}, \phi_{22}, \dots, \phi_{p2}$. This continues until all
principal components have been computed. Therefore anomaly detection
using PCA will maximize the difference in behaviors across time blocks
and variable attributes. Thus, identifying anomalies with PCA will
identify those attributes that behave very differently than all the
other features. To perform a principal components analysis we use
`principal_components()` which will create a list containing:

`$pca_sdev`

:   the standard deviations of the principal components (i.e., the
    square roots of the eigenvalues of the covariance/correlation
    matrix, though the calculation is actually done with the singular
    values of the data matrix).

`$pca_loadings`

:   the matrix of variable loadings (i.e., a matrix whose columns
    contain the eigenvectors).

`$pca_rotated`

:   the value of the rotated data (the centered, and scaled if
    requested, data multiplied by the rotation matrix) is returned.

`$pca_center`

:   the centering used.

`$pca_scale`

:   a logical response indicating whether scaling was used.

``` r
principal_components(state_vec) %>% names
# [1] "pca_sdev"     "pca_loadings" "pca_rotated"  "pca_center"  
# [5] "pca_scale"
```

For easy access to these results we can use the
`principal_components_result` parsing function. The
`principal_components_result` will parse the results either by their
list name or by location. For example, to extract the computed component
scores as outlined in Eq. 8 you can use
`principal_components_result(data, results = pca_rotated)` or
`principal_components_result(data, results = 3)` as demonstrated below.

``` r
state_vec %>%
  principal_components() %>%
  principal_components_result(pca_rotated) %>%
  as_tibble
# A tibble: 30 × 26

We can then follow the principal components analysis with similar
visualization activities as performed post-factor analysis to identify
features that exhibit abnormal behavior. Since visualizing principal
components analysis to identify anomolies mirrors that which we
performed in the factor analysis section, we will leave this to the
reader as an independent exercise.

## Conclusion

Cyber attacks continue to be a growing concern for organizations.
Unfortunately, the process of analyzing log files has, historically,
been unorganized and lacked efficient approaches. The presented
*anomalyDetection* package makes the log file analysis process more
efficient and facilitates the identification and analysis of anomalies
within log files.

First, *anomalyDetection* improves the pre-processing of cyber data. The
package offers functions that help to narrow down abnormal behavior by
aggregating internet traffic data into customizable time blocks.
Aggregated activity at a higher-level time block should be easier to
analyze while still offering a map to suspicious areas to drill down
using smaller time blocks. For very large data sets, the analyst can
tune the function parameters to start with less blocks and more
aggregated data and then iteratively drill down into less aggregated
data. Furthermore, *anomalyDetection* improves the process of adjusting
for multicollinearity concerns.

Second, *anomalyDetection* improves the modeling process to perform
multivariate statistical analysis by offering built-in functions to
perform Mahalanobis distance, factor analysis, and principal components
analysis along with functions to improve the efficiency of extracting
and assessing the results from these multivariate approaches.

Third, we demonstrated how the *anomalyDetection* incorporates the pipe
operator (`%>%`) to allow it to work well in the *tidyverse* workflow,
which helps to improve the overall efficiency of the data analysis
process.

It is also important to note that although the authors' focus with this
package was to target and improve the analysis of network log-file data,
*anomalyDetection* can also be used for other large data sets that
contain arbitrary features that require data aggregation and anomaly
analysis. Furthermore, as with any package, we readily admit that
further improvements to the package can be made. Future versions of
*anomalyDetection* plan to integrate additional multivariate and time
series approaches to offer analysts a wider suite of modeling tools.
Integrating plotting functions are also planned for future iterations to
further enhance the efficiency of visualizing analytic results.
Furthermore, future updates could explore how *anomalyDetection* could
interact with distributable systems such as spark by integrating
capabilities from packages such as *SparkR*. This would improve
*anomalyDetection*'s ability to work with Big data architectures.
