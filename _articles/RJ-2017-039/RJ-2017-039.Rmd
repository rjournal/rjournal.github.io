title: 'anomalyDetection: Implementation of Augmented Network Log Anomaly Detection
  Procedures'
abstract: As the number of cyber-attacks continues to grow on a daily basis, so does
  the delay in threat detection. For instance, in 2015, the Office of Personnel Management
  discovered that approximately 21.5 million individual records of Federal employees
  and contractors had been stolen. On average, the time between an attack and its
  discovery is more than 200 days. In the case of the OPM breach, the attack had been
  going on for almost a year. Currently, cyber analysts inspect numerous potential
  incidents on a daily basis, but have neither the time nor the resources available
  to perform such a task. anomalyDetection aims to curtail the time frame in which
  anomalous cyber activities go unnoticed and to aid in the efficient discovery of
  these anomalous transactions among the millions of daily logged events by i) providing
  an efficient means for pre-processing and aggregating cyber data for analysis by
  employing a tabular vector transformation and handling multicollinearity concerns;
  ii) offering numerous built-in multivariate statistical functions such as Mahalanobis
  distance, factor analysis, principal components analysis to identify anomalous activity,
  iii) incorporating the pipe operator (%>%) to allow it to work well in the tidyverse
  workflow. Combined, anomalyDetection offers cyber analysts an efficient and simplified
  approach to break up network events into time-segment blocks and identify periods
  associated with suspected anomalies for further evaluation.
