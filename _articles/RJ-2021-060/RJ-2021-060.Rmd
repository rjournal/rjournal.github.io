title: 'gofCopula: Goodness-of-Fit Tests for Copulae'
abstract: The last decades show an increased interest in modeling various types of
  data through copulae. Different copula models have been developed, which lead to
  the challenge of finding the best fitting model for a particular dataset. From the
  other side, a strand of literature developed a list of different Goodness-of-Fit
  (GoF) tests with different powers under different conditions. The usual practice
  is the selection of the best copula via the $p$-value of the GoF test. Although
  this method is not purely correct due to the fact that non-rejection does not imply
  acception, this strategy is favored by practitioners. Unfortunately, different GoF
  tests often provide contradicting outputs. The proposed R-package brings under one
  umbrella 13 most used copulae - plus their rotated variants - together with 16 GoF
  tests and a hybrid one. The package offers flexible margin modeling, automatized
  parallelization, parameter estimation, as well as a user-friendly interface, and
  pleasant visualizations of the results. To illustrate the functionality of the package,
  two exemplary applications are provided.
