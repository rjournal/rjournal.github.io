title: Model Builder for Item Factor Analysis with OpenMx
abstract: 'We introduce a shiny web application to facilitate the construction of
  Item Factor Analysis (a.k.a. Item Response Theory) models using the OpenMx package.
  The web application assists with importing data, outcome recoding, and model specification.
  However, the app does not conduct any analysis but, rather, generates an analysis
  script. Generated Rmarkdown output serves dual purposes: to analyze a data set and
  demonstrate good programming practices. The app can be used as a teaching tool or
  as a starting point for custom analysis scripts.'
