title: 'Fast Pure R Implementation of GEE: Application of the Matrix Package'
abstract: Generalized estimating equation solvers in R only allow for a few pre-determined
  options for the link and variance functions. We provide a package, geeM, which is
  implemented entirely in R and allows for user specified link and variance functions.
  The sparse matrix representations provided in the Matrix package enable a fast implementation.
  To gain speed, we make use of analytic inverses of the working correlation when
  possible and a trick to find quick numeric inverses when an analytic inverse is
  not available. Through three examples, we demonstrate the speed of geeM, which is
  not much worse than C implementations like geepack and gee on small data sets and
  faster on large data sets.
