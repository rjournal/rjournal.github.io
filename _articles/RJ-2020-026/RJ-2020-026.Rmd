title: 'BayesMallows: An R Package for the Bayesian Mallows Model'
abstract: 'BayesMallows is an R package for analyzing preference data in the form
  of rankings with the Mallows rank model, and its finite mixture extension, in a
  Bayesian framework. The model is grounded on the idea that the probability density
  of an observed ranking decreases exponentially with the distance to the location
  parameter. It is the first Bayesian implementation that allows wide choices of distances,
  and it works well with a large amount of items to be ranked. BayesMallows handles
  non-standard data: partial rankings and pairwise comparisons, even in cases including
  non-transitive preference patterns. The Bayesian paradigm allows coherent quantification
  of posterior uncertainties of estimates of any quantity of interest. These posteriors
  are fully available to the user, and the package comes with convienient tools for
  summarizing and visualizing the posterior distributions.'
