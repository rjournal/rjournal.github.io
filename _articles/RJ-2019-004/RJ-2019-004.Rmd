title: 'Time Series Forecasting with KNN in R: the tsfknn Package'
abstract: In this paper the tsfknn package for time series forecasting using k-nearest
  neighbor regres sion is described. This package allows users to specify a KNN model
  and to generate its forecasts. The user can choose among different multi-step ahead
  strategies and among different functions to aggregate the targets of the nearest
  neighbors. It is also possible to assess the forecast accuracy of the KNN model.
