title: 'ClusTorus: An R Package for Prediction and Clustering on the Torus by Conformal
  Prediction'
abstract: Protein structure data consist of several dihedral angles, lying on a multidimensional
  torus. Analyzing such data has been and continues to be key in understanding functional
  properties of proteins. However, most of the existing statistical methods assume
  that data are on Euclidean spaces, and thus they are improper to deal with angular
  data. In this paper, we introduce the package ClusTorus specialized to analyzing
  multivariate angular data. The package collects some tools and routines to perform
  algorithmic clustering and model-based clustering for data on the torus. In particular,
  the package enables the construction of conformal prediction sets and predictive
  clustering, based on kernel density estimates and mixture model estimates. A novel
  hyperparameter selection strategy for predictive clustering is also implemented,
  with improved stability and computational efficiency. We demonstrate the use of
  the package in clustering protein dihedral angles from two real data sets.
