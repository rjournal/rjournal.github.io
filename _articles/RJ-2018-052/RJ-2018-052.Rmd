title: Forecast Combinations in R using the ForecastComb Package
abstract: This paper introduces the R package ForecastComb. The aim is to provide
  researchers and practitioners with a comprehensive implementation of the most common
  ways in which forecasts can be combined. The package in its current version covers
  15 popular estimation methods for creating a combined forecasts â€“ including simple
  methods, regression-based methods, and eigenvector-based methods. It also includes
  useful tools to deal with common challenges of forecast combination (e.g., missing
  values in component forecasts, or multicollinearity), and to rationalize and visualize
  the combination results.
