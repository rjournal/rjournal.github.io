title: 'IsoGene: An R Package for Analyzing Dose-response Studies in Microarray Experiments'
abstract: IsoGene is an R package for the analysis of dose-response microarray experiments
  to identify gene or subsets of genes with a monotone relationship between the gene
  expression and the doses. Several testing procedures (i.e., the likelihood ratio
  test, Williams, Marcus, the M, and Modified M), that take into account the order
  restriction of the means with respect to the increasing doses are implemented in
  the package. The inference is based on resampling methods, both permutations and
  the Significance Analysis of Microarrays (SAM).
