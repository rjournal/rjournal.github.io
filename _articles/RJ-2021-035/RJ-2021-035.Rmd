title: 'pdynmc: A Package for Estimating Linear Dynamic Panel Data Models Based on
  Nonlinear Moment Conditions'
abstract: ' This paper introduces [pdynmc](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=pdynmc),
  an R package that provides users sufficient flexibility and precise control over
  the estimation and inference in linear dynamic panel data models. The package primarily
  allows for the inclusion of nonlinear moment conditions and the use of iterated
  GMM; additionally, visualizations for data structure and estimation results are
  provided. The current implementation reflects recent developments in literature,
  uses sensible argument defaults, and aligns commercial and noncommercial estimation
  commands. Since the understanding of the model assumptions is vital for setting
  up plausible estimation routines, we provide a broad introduction of linear dynamic
  panel data models directed towards practitioners before concisely describing the
  functionality available in pdynmc regarding instrument type, covariate type, estimation
  methodology, and general configuration. We then demonstrate the functionality by
  revisiting the popular firm-level dataset of @AreBon1991. '
