# Introduction {#sec:intro}

Multi-state models are commonly used to analyze complex longitudinal
survival data involving multiple events of interest ([@Andersen1993];
[@Hougaard2000]; [@Putter2007]; [@MM2009]; [@LFMM2019]). These models
can be considered as a generalization of the survival process where
survival is the ultimate outcome of interest, but where information is
available about intermediate events that individuals may experience
during the study period. For instance, in some biomedical applications,
besides the 'healthy' initial state and the absorbing 'dead' state, one
may observe intermediate (transient) states based on health conditions
(e.g., heart or lung disease), disease stages (e.g., stages of cancer,
HIV infection or Alzheimer's), clinical symptoms (e.g., bleeding
episodes), biological markers (e.g., CD4 T-lymphocyte cell counts; serum
immunoglobulin levels) or they can represent a non-fatal complication in
the course of the illness (e.g., cancer recurrence, transplantation,
etc.). The number of states and transitions among them defines the
complexity of the model, which is illustrated by a directed graph with
rectangular boxes representing possible states and arrows representing
the allowed transitions. Among the multi-state models, the simplest is
the mortality model for survival data (with only two states). The
competing risks model ([@Andersen2002]; [@Putter2007]) can be seen as an
extension of the simple mortality model for survival data in which each
individual may 'die' due to any of several causes. The most common is
the illness-death model, also known as the disability model, which
comprises three states. In the irreversible version of this model
(Figure 1), individuals start in the 'alive and disease-free' state and
subsequently move either to the 'diseased' state or to the 'dead' state.
Individuals in the 'diseased' state will eventually move to the 'dead'
state, without any possibility of recovery. Data that arises from the
model depicted in Figure 1 has been termed as semi-competing risk data
and can be seen as an emerging challenge for time-to-event data where
two events of interest are studied: non-terminal (e.g., disease
diagnosis) and terminal (e.g., death) events. The non-terminal event is
observed only if it precedes the terminal event, which may occur before
or after the non-terminal event. In this context, the terminal event is
a competing risk for the intermediate state but not the contrary
([@Xu2010]; [@Li2017]; [@Nevo2020]).

Multi-state models can be used to assess the effects of covariates on
the transition intensities, but they can also be used to obtain
conditional prediction probabilities of future events. From the
transition intensities, it is possible to evaluate the probability of
one event ahead, but the transition probabilities are the relevant
predictive quantities since they consider several transitions ahead. The
occupation probabilities, often used in practice, are particular
examples of transition probabilities in which the time origin is taken
as the current time. When the underlying stochastic process is Markov,
an elegant theory can be used to link the transition intensities to the
transition probabilities, leading to the Aalen-Johansen estimator
[@AJ1978]. This assumption claims that given the present state, the
future evolution of the process is independent of the states previously
visited and the transition times among them; in other words, the history
of the process is summarized by the current state. The Aalen-Johansen
estimator is adapted to censoring, and benefits from the assumption of
Markovianity to get consistent estimates. However, when the multi-state
model is non-Markov, this is no longer the case. In fact, there are many
applications for which the Markov assumption may not be met; for
example, the arrival time at the current state of the process often
influences the transition intensities, leading to non-Markov structures
([@Andersen2000], [@Andersen2002]). Although the Aalen--Johansen
estimator may be used to consistently estimate occupation probabilities
for non-Markov multi-state models [@Datta2001], in general it provides
biased estimators if the Markov assumption does not hold. To tackle this
issue, [@MM2006] introduced, for the first time, estimators that do not
rely on the Markov assumption. These authors showed the practical
superiority of their estimators relative to the Aalen-Johansen estimator
in situations in which the Markov condition is strongly violated.
However, this approach has the drawback of requiring that the support of
the censoring distribution contains the support of the lifetime
distribution, otherwise they only report valid estimators for truncated
transition probabilities. Recently, alternative estimators that are
consistent regardless of the Markov condition and the referred
assumption on the censoring support were proposed by [@AlvarezMM2015].
The idea behind the proposed estimators is to use a procedure based on
differences between Kaplan-Meier estimators derived from a subset of the
data, consisting of all subjects observed to be in a given state at a
given time. The same idea of subsampling, combined with the
Aalen-Johansen estimator, was later used by @PutterSpitoni2018 to
introduce new estimators which were termed landmark Aalen-Johansen.

In the multi-state setting, it is of practical interest to determine
whether the Markov property holds within a particular data set. This
information can be used to assess the validity of the transition
probability estimates as well as the best option for performing
inference on the transition intensities when one aims to relate the
individual characteristics to the intensity rates through a multi-state
regression model. This assumption is usually checked by including
covariates depending on the history ([@Kay1986]; [@Andersen2000];
[@Andersen2002]). For the progressive illness-death model, for example,
the Markov assumption is particularly relevant for modeling the death
transition after disease and, consequently, assessing whether this
transition rate is affected by the time in the previous state.
Alternative methods, based on a local Kendall's tau measuring the
future-past association along time, were proposed by @Girondo2012 and
@Girondo2016. The method proposed by these authors can be used for
three-state progressive and illness-death models, but the extension of
this test to general multi-state models is not straightforward, and thus
flexible methods that may be used in general models are required. A very
recent work by @Titman2020 considers new approaches for checking this
assumption. In one of these approaches, local and general tests have
been developed by considering summaries from families of log-rank
statistics where individuals are grouped by the state occupied at
varying initial time $s$. @Chiou2018 also considered an equivalent
problem to testing Markovianity (in the progressive illness-model) but
involving tests for dependent truncation. Making use of the landmark
approach, @soutinho_machado2020 introduces new methods for checking the
Markov assumption through a local and global test given by measuring the
discrepancy between the Aalen-Johansen estimator and the landmark
estimators ([@AlvarezMM2015], [@PutterSpitoni2018]) that are free of the
Markov condition.

There are some software packages available for multi-state survival
analysis. A comprehensive list of the available packages in the
Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN) can be seen in the CRAN task view
'Survival Analysis' [@Allignol2018]. In particular, in the context of
multi-state models, [mstate](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=mstate)
package provides functions for estimating hazards and probabilities,
possibly depending on covariates. This package also permits checking the
Markov assumption from families of log-rank statistics where individuals
are grouped by the state occupied at different times [@Titman2020]. The
[msm](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=msm) package can be used to fit
a Markov model with any number of states and any pattern of transitions
to panel data. It includes several extensions, such as hidden Markov
models and models whose transition intensities vary with
individual-specific or time-varying covariates [@Jackson2011].
[survidm](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=survidm) package provides
estimates of predictive probabilities, such as the transition
probabilities, occupation probabilities, cumulative incidence functions,
and waiting (sojourn) time distributions. It also allows one to perform
multi-state regression for transition intensities as well as to
implement global tests for the Markov assumption in illness-death models
[@soutinho2021]. Other examples are the
[SemiMarkov](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=SemiMarkov) package that
can be used to fit semi-Markov multistate models to longitudinal data
proposed by [@Krol2015] and the
[frailtyEM](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=frailtyEM) which contains
functions for fitting shared frailty models with a semi-parametric
baseline hazard with the Expectation-Maximization algorithm
[@Balan2019]. Multi-state regression can be performed using several of
the aforementioned packages by decoupling the whole process into various
survival models, by fitting separate intensities to all permitted
transitions using, for example, semi-parametric Cox proportional hazard
regression models, while making appropriate adjustments to the risk set.
To this end, the [JM](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=JM) and
[joineR](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=joineR) packages, proposed
by [@JM] and [@joineR], can be useful to estimate the parameters for the
joint modeling of longitudinal and time-to-event data. In this context,
we can also refer to the
[joineRML](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=joineRML) which extends
the inference of the joint model to the case of multiple continuous
longitudinal measures [@joineRML].

The organization of this paper is as follows: In Section 2, we present a
brief introduction of the notation and the mathematical background of
existing methods for testing the Markov assumption. In Section 3, we
introduce the [markovMSM](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=markovMSM)
package, a software application for R that performs these local and
global tests in the multi-state models described in
[@soutinho_machado2020] using three real data examples. Finally, the
main conclusions are reported in Section 4.

[@soutinho_machado2020].

## Multi-state models and transition probabilities {#multi}

A multi-state model $(X(t),t\in [0,\infty))$ is a model for a time
continuous stochastic process. These models provide a relevant modeling
framework for dealing with complex longitudinal survival data, since
they allow the representation of the movement of the individuals among a
set of finite states space $\mathcal{S}={1,\ldots ,K}$. They can be
fully characterized through the transition probabilities, for two states
$h$, $j$ and two time points $s < t$, that are given by the conditional
probability $p_{hj}(s,t)=P(X(t)=j|X(s)=h, \mathcal{H}_{s-})$, where
$\mathcal{H}_{s-}$ denotes the history of the process up to time $s$.
This history can represent information about the process, such as the
states previously visited, transition times, etc. Under the Markov
assumption, $P(X(t)=j|X(s)=h, X(u)=y)=P(X(t)=j|X(s)=h)$, for any
$0\leq u<s$ and $y \in \mathcal{S}$, and thus, the future of the process
after time $s$ depends only on the state occupied at time $s$, not on
the arrival time to that state or on the states previously visited.

Without loss of generality and for the purpose of simplicity, let us
consider the progressive illness-death model, with state space
$\{1,2,3\}$, given by the initial State (e.g., 'alive and disease-free';
State 1), the intermediate state (e.g., 'diseased'; State 2), and the
absorbing state (e.g., 'dead'; State 3). For this type of model, there
are five different transition probabilities to be considered that can be
obtained as follows [@LFMM2019]:

::: center
$p_{11}(s,t) = \exp\left(-\int_s^t \left(\lambda_{12}(u)+\lambda_{13}(u)\right)du\right)$
:::

::: center
$p_{22}(s,t\mid t_{12})= \exp\left(-\int_s^t \lambda_{23}(u,
t_{12})du\right)$
:::

::: center
$p_{12}(s,t) =\int_s^t p_{11}(s,u-)\lambda_{12}(u)p_{22}(u,t\mid
u)du$.
:::

Here, $p_{22}(s, t\mid t_{12})$ denotes the transition probability
$p_{22}$ conditional on a particular entry time $t_{12}$, and
$\lambda_{hj}(.)$ correspond to the transition intensities that are the
instantaneous hazards for movement from one state ($h$) to another
($j$). If the process is Markov, $h_{23}(t, t_{12})=h_{23}(t)$ and
$p_{22}(s, t\mid t_{12})=p_{22}(s, t)$. The two other transition
probabilities, $p_{13}(s,t)$ and $p_{23}(s,t)$, can be estimated from
the two obvious relations that exist in the progressive illness-death
model: $p_{11}(s,t)+p_{12}(s,t)+p_{13}(s,t)=1$ and
$p_{22}(s,t)+p_{23}(s,t)=1$. Expressions for general models are not
possible. Since the prognosis for an individual in the intermediate
state may be influenced by the subject's specific arrival time, the
illness-death model is not necessarily Markovian.

The estimation of the transition probabilities is a major goal in
multi-state models since they allow for long-term predictions. A common
nonparametric method to estimate these quantities is the Aalen-Johansen
( AJ) estimator, [@AJ1978] which can be obtained as the
product--integral of the Nelson-Aalen estimators for the cumulative
transition intensities [@Andersen1993]. Explicit formulae of the
Aalen-Johansen estimator for the illness-death model can be found in
[@Borgan2005]. When the multi-state process is Markovian, the AJ
estimator provides consistent estimates of the transition probabilities,
but this is no longer the case if the process is non-Markov. To avoid
this problem, [@AlvarezMM2015] use the idea of subsampling, also
referred to as landmarking [@VanHouwelingen2007], which is based on
(differences between) Kaplan-Meier estimators derived from a subset of
the data consisting of all subjects observed to be in the given state at
the given time. For the specific case of the illness-death model, given
the time point $s$, to estimate $p_{1j}(s,t)$ for $j=1,2,3$ the landmark
analysis is restricted to the individuals observed in State 1 at time
$s$; whereas, to estimate $p_{2j}(s,t)$, $j=2,3$, the landmark analysis
proceeds from the sample restricted to the individuals observed in State
2 at time $s$. Further details on the formulae and proofs can be seen in
[@AlvarezMM2015]. The subsampling approach was later used by
@PutterSpitoni2018 to derive a landmark Aalen-Johansen estimator ( LMAJ)
of the transition probabilities. The idea behind the proposed estimator
is to use the Aalen-Johansen estimator of the state occupation
probabilities derived from those subsets (consisting of subjects
occupying a given state at a particular time) for which consistency has
already been proved in multi-state models that are not necessarily
Markov [@Datta2001]. It is worth mentioning that, in the illness-death
model, the landmark Aalen-Johansen estimators ( LMAJ) and the landmark
estimators ( LM) of the transition probabilities have shown similar
performances. However, the former methods ( LMAJ) can be used in general
multi-state models, which can be considered an advantage.

From now on, we will use the abbreviation AJ for the Aalen-Johansen
estimator, LM for the LandMark estimator proposed by [@AlvarezMM2015],
and LMAJ for the LandMark Aalen-Johansen estimator [@PutterSpitoni2018].

## Tests for the Markov assumption {#sec2.3}

***Modeling particular transition intensities***\
\
Traditionally, the Markov condition is verified by modeling particular
transition intensities on aspects of the history of the process using a
proportional hazard model ([@Kay1986]; [@Andersen2000; @Andersen2002]).
In the progressive illness-death model, the Markov condition is
particularly relevant for the transition from the intermediate state
'disease' (State 2) to 'death' (State 3). Under this model, we can
examine whether the time spent in the initial state (State 1) is
important in the transition from the disease state to death or not. For
doing that, let $\lambda_{23}(t)$ denote the hazard function of $T$ for
those individuals going from State 2 to State 3. Fitting a Cox model
$\lambda_{23}(t\mid Z)=\lambda_{23,0}(t)\exp(\beta Z)$, where
$\lambda_{23,0}$ is the baseline hazard, $Z$ the 'time spent in the
healthy (initial) state' and $\beta$ a regression parameter, we now need
to test the null hypothesis, if the transition rate from the disease
state into death is unaffected by the time spent in the healthy state,
$H_0:\beta=0$, against the general alternative, $H_1:\beta\neq 0$. This
'global' test, based on the semiparametric Cox proportional hazards
model, assumes proportional hazards and a linear effect on the hazard
for the covariate. When either of these two assumptions is not
fulfilled, the test may not be able to detect the lack of Markovianity.

Since the landmark methods ( LM) for estimating the transition
probabilities proposed by [@AlvarezMM2015], and ( LMAJ) by
[@PutterSpitoni2018] are free of the Markov assumption, they can be used
as a basis for the construction of tests for Markovianity. These ideas
were used by [@soutinho_machado2020] to introduce local and global tests
for Markovianity based on the discrepancy of the landmark estimators to
Markovian Aalen-Johansen estimators ( AJ). Subsampling, also known as
landmarking, has been also used by [@Titman2020] to introduce a general
test based on summaries from families of log-rank statistics where
individuals are grouped by the state they occupied at a given (landmark)
time.\
***AUC Local Test***\
\
[@soutinho_machado2020] introduce a local test based on the area under
curve, AUC, given by the estimated transition probabilities, for a fixed
time $s>0$, that can be used for a general multi-state model for
checking the Markovianity of the process. They propose the following
test statistic that is based on the difference between the area under
the estimated transition probability curve for the non-Markov LMAJ
estimator and the AJ estimator, $U=\int_{s}^{\tau}
\left(\widehat p_{hj}^{\texttt{ LMAJ}}(s,u) - \widehat p_{hj}^{\texttt{ AJ}}(s,u)\right)du$,
where $\tau$ is the upper bound of the support of $T$. When the process
is Markovian, it is expected that the test statistic will be close to
zero. The Markov assumption becomes less likely as the test statistic
gets further away from zero in either direction. Because of censoring,
both estimators ( LMAJ and AJ) may reveal high variability in the right
tail, which may inflate the test statistic. In addition to this issue,
since landmarking is based on reduced data, the maximum point for which
the LMAJ transition probability estimate is strictly defined may be
lower than the maximum point for AJ. To address these issues, we propose
that when computing $U$, the minimum between the upper bound for which
LMAJ is defined and the 90*th* percentile of the total time for the
upper limit in the integral that defines the test statistic be used.

In the progressive illness-death model, besides the transition
probability $\widehat p_{23}(s,t)$, $\widehat p_{12}(s,t)$ can also be
used to test the Markov assumption. For general multi-state models, one
can use transitions depending on history. In fact, if the goal is to
decide which estimator is the most appropriate to use to estimate a
specific transition probability $p_{hj}(s,t)$, then the test statistic
should be the one based on that same transition probability.

To approximate the distributions of the test statistic, bootstrap
methods with a large number of resamples, $M$, are used. We generate $M$
bootstrap samples, and for each sample, we calculate the test statistic
$U^{\star}$ which corresponds to the difference between the areas of the
`AJ` and the `LMAJ` estimators. Finally, the variance
$\sigma^{\star}_{(U^{\star})}$ is obtained from the $M$ values of
$U^{\star}$. Then, according to large sample asymptotic distribution
theory, when $M$, the number of replicates, goes to infinity, we have
the following statistic distributed approximately as a standard normal
distribution with a mean of 0 and variance of 1:
$V=(U-0)/\sigma^{\star}_{(U^{\star})}\sim N(0,1)$. The null hypothesis
will be rejected if $V>v_{(1-\alpha/2)}$ or $V<v_{(\alpha/2)}$, where
$v_{(\alpha/2)}$ and $v_{(1-\alpha/2)}$ denote the $\alpha/2$ and
$1-\alpha/2$ percentiles, respectively, of a normal distribution with a
mean of 0 and variance of 1.\
***AUC Global Test***\
\
[@soutinho_machado2020] also introduce a global test, which can be
achieved by combining the results obtained from local tests over
different times. The testing procedure used here involves the following
steps:

1.  Using the original sample of the illness-death model, obtain the
    percentiles 5, 10, 20, 30, and 40 of the times spent by all
    individuals in State 1, the so-called waiting (soujorn) time. For
    general multi-state models, we recommend the use of the same
    percentiles of the subject's specific arrival time at the
    corresponding state.

2.  For each of the values $s$ obtained in Step 1, obtain the
    probability values for the local method as explained before.

3.  Obtain the mean of the probability values for each closest pair;
    i.e., the mean of the probability values of the following pairs of
    percentiles: $(5,10)$, $(10,20)$, $(20,30)$ and $(30,40)$.

4.  Finally, the *p*-value for the global test is equal to the minimum
    between the four probability values obtained in Step 3. In the case
    of this probability value being below a particular significance
    value, for example $0.05$, we reject the null hypothesis of the
    process being Markovian.

Step 1 considers a global test based on local tests computed at low
percentiles of subject-specific arrival times at the corresponding
state. This is based on our experience that the failure of Markovianity
often occurs at small transition times. Besides the hypothesis tests
proposed above, we also suggest graphical local tests that can be used
to check the Markov assumption in the illness-death model as well as for
more complex multi-state models, possibly with reversible transitions
between states. These graphical tests can be used to validate the
default values proposed in Step 1 or to propose alternative values for
which a discrepancy between the two methods ( LMAJ and AJ) is more
evident.

The procedure described in Step 3 can be used to ensure that there is a
discrepancy between the two estimated curves over a large range of time
values.\
***Log-rank test***\
\
The construction of the landmark Aalen-Johansen estimators ( LMAJ) also
motivated the development of new tests of the Markov assumption
[@Titman2020]. Assume initially that interest lies in assessing the
validity of transition probability estimates from a specific start point
time $s$ and a given state $h$, i.e. $p_{hj}(s,t)$. Under the landmark
approach, the estimators of the transition probabilities should be
derived from the subset of the data consisting of all subjects observed
to be in the state $h$ at time $s$, $S=\{i:X_i(s)=j, Y_i(s)=1\}$ where
$Y_i(s)$ is the at risk indicator of the process ([@AlvarezMM2015];
[@PutterSpitoni2018]). On the other hand, the Aalen-Johansen estimator
would use also the set of subjects in
$S^c=\{i:X_i(s)\neq j, Y_i(s)=1\}$. Besides, under a Markov process, the
transition intensities of the process for $t>s$ will be the same in the
two groups. This motivated [@Titman2020] to propose a local test for the
Markov assumption that lies in testing
$H_0: \lambda(t|X(s)=h)= \lambda(t|X(s)\neq h)$ for $t\geq s$ versus a
general alternative. The proposed test is constructed using several
log-rank statistics grouped by membership in $S$. [@Titman2020] also
propose a global test via a grid of times in which, for each $s$ time,
local tests are computed. In this paper, the grid of values is given by
the percentile times.

The same authors pointed out that the use of the individual supremum or
integrated statistics may be combined to provide an overall test of the
dependence of the transition intensities on occupation in state $j$ at
previous times.

# Application of the markovMSM {#sec: package}

This section offers the guidelines for the use of the
[markovMSM](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=markovMSM) package with
the R statistical program [@R]. To this end, a description of the
functions of the package is illustrated using three real data sets. The
first one involves data from a clinical trial on colon cancer modeled
using the progressive illness-death model [@Moertel1995]. Extensions to
progressive processes beyond the three-state illness-death model are
demonstrated using data from the European Group for Blood and Marrow
Transplantation (EBMT) [@Putter2007]. Finally, we use data from a study
with liver cirrhosis patients subjected to prednisone treatment
[@Andersen1993]. The package comprises seven main functions, which are
briefly summarized in Table [1](#Tab1){reference-type="ref"
reference="Tab1"}.

## Data manipulation {#sec:conc}

In this section, we reanalyze data from a large clinical trial on Duke's
stage III patients affected by colon cancer who underwent curative
surgery for colorectal cancer [@Moertel1990]. Of the 929 patients, 468
developed a recurrence, and among these, 414 died; 38 died without a
recurrence. The remaining 423 patients were alive and disease-free up to
the end of the follow-up. Besides the two event times (time to
recurrence and time to death) and the corresponding indicator statuses,
a vector of covariates including age, sex, number of lymph nodes, and
extent of local spread is also available. Below is an excerpt of the
data set with one row per individual. Individuals were chosen in order
to represent all possible combinations of movements among the three
states.

The four initial variables describe the movement of the patients among
the three states of the illness-death model: time1 denote the time
measured in days from surgery to recurrence, whereas Stime is the total
time or the time to death or censoring; event1 and event denote the
corresponding status/censoring indicator (1 for an event and 0 for
censoring). Patient 1 had a recurrence after 968 days (i.e., observed a
transition from the initial state to the intermediate state) and then
died after 1521 days in the study. Patient 2 remained alive and without
recurrence at the end of follow-up ( event1 = 0 and event = 0). The two
event times are equal in these cases. The patient represented in the
third line had a recurrence after 1323 days but remained alive at the
end of the follow-up (i.e., in State 2). Finally, the patient
represented in the last line died after 2789 days in the study without
experiencing a recurrence.

As the original data set is in the wide format, the next step to
implementing the proposed methods will be to convert the data into a
long format, which is given by one line for each transition for which a
subject is at risk. This can be done using functions transMatMSM and
prepMSM. transMatMSM function defines the transition matrices, revealing
which transitions are possible, whereas prepMSM provides a new dataset
in a long format for which each row will correspond to a transition for
which a patient is at risk. For the progressive illness-death model,
these two functions are used as follows:

::: example
\> positions \<- list(c(2, 3), c(3), c()) \> state.names \<-
c(\"Alive\", \"Rec\", \"Death\") \> tmat \<- transMatMSM(positions,
state.names) \> tmat to from Alive Rec Death Alive NA 1 2 Rec NA NA 3
Death NA NA NA

\> timesNames \<- c(NA, \"time1\", \"Stime\") \> status \<- c(NA,
\"event1\", \"event\") \> trans \<- tmat \> db_long \<- prepMSM(data =
db_wide, trans, timesNames, status) \> db_long\[1:10,\]

963 421 1 9 4 1 2 1 0 245 245 1 10 4 1 3 2 0 245 245 0
:::

Finally, in terms of manipulation of data, a useful function is
eventsMSM since it allows one to summarise the number of transitions
among states and their percentages:

::: example
\> eventsMSM(db_long)

## Methods for testing the Markov condition in the illness-death model {#sec:mkv tests1}

The illness-death model is a special multi-state model with several
applications in the biomedical literature. Many time-to-event data sets
with multiple end points can be reduced to this generic structure.
Unlike the survival or competing risk models, this model is not
necessarily Markovian since the prognosis for an individual in the
intermediate state may be influenced by the subject's specific arrival
time. Traditionally, the Markov assumption is checked by including
covariates depending on the history. In the particular case of the colon
cancer data set, we are interested in assessing if the transition rate
from the recurrence state into death is unaffected by the time spent in
the previous state. This global test for the Markov assumption can be
done using the function PHM.test. A brief description of the arguments
of this function is shown in
Table [\[Tab-PHM.test\]](#Tab-PHM.test){reference-type="ref"
reference="Tab-PHM.test"}. Results for this global test of our data
indicated that the effect of the time spent in State 1 is not
significant (*p*-value of 0.154), revealing no evidence against the
Markov model for the colon data. The corresponding input codes are the
following:

::: example
\> res \<- PHM.test(data = db_long, from = 2, to = 3) \[1\] 0.1543195 \>
res $p.value
[1] 0.1543195$from \[1\] 2 $to
[1] 3

The input commands to perform the AUC local test, for a fixed time$s=180$and transitions 1$$2 and 1$$3 are the following:

%\begin{CodeChunk}
%\begin{CodeInput}
\begin{example}
> set.seed(1234)

:::

As a result, the function AUC.test returns the probability values for
all attainable transitions from the initial state. To obtain the same
local test for transition 2$\rightarrow$`<!-- -->`{=html}3, we only need
to put 2 in the parameter from as follows:

::: example
\> set.seed(1234) \> res3 \<- AUC.test(data = db_long, times = 180, from

Results reveal a possible failure of the Markov assumption with low probability values for transitions 1$$2 and 2$$3 for$s=180$(less than 5\%). These findings agree with the results depicted in Figure~\ref{fig4}, which reports the estimated transition probabilities. In fact, we can observe departures between the two Markov-free estimators (\texorpdfstring%
{{\normalfont\ttfamily\hyphenchar\font=-1 LM}}%
{LM} and \texorpdfstring%
{{\normalfont\ttfamily\hyphenchar\font=-1 LMAJ}}%
{LMAJ}) and the Aalen-Johansen estimator (\texorpdfstring%
{{\normalfont\ttfamily\hyphenchar\font=-1 AJ}}%
{AJ}) revealing a possible failure of the Markov assumption. The input commands to obtain the plots shown in Figure~\ref{fig4} are the following:

%\begin{CodeChunk}

\begin{example}
> plot(res2, to = 2, axis.scale = c(0,0.25), difP = FALSE) #Figure 2 (Left column)

Putting the parameter \texorpdfstring%

{difP=TRUE}, we can also obtain the discrepancy between the Aalen-Johansen estimator (Markovian) and the landmark non-Markovian estimator (\texorpdfstring%

\end{figure}

The plots in Figure \ref{fig6} can be thought of as graphical local tests for the Markov assumption. As expected, in both cases they reveal differences between the two methods for$s=180$since they show a clear deviation with respect to the horizontal line$y=0$. From these, one gets some (graphical) evidence of the lack of Markovianity of the underlying process beyond half a year after surgery. Therefore, for this specific time, the application of the Aalen-Johansen method may not be recommended here, due to possible biases. %They also reveal a possible failure of the Markov assumption.

In Section 2, a global test was also introduced that combines the probability values of the local test over different times (given by the percentiles of the sojourn time in State 1). In the \href{https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=markovMSM}{\texorpdfstring%
{{\normalfont\fontseries{b}\selectfont markovMSM}}%
{markovMSM}} package, this can be obtained using the function \texorpdfstring%
{{\normalfont\ttfamily\hyphenchar\font=-1 AUC.test}}%
{AUC.test}. The arguments for this function are described in Table~\ref{Tab3}. Some examples of how to perform the proposed AUC global test are shown in the following input commands, in which we consider the default percentiles in the argument \texttt{quantiles}. Depending on the number of replicas, the implementation of the \texorpdfstring%
{{\normalfont\ttfamily\hyphenchar\font=-1 AUC.test}}%
{AUC.test} function can be computationally time-consuming.

%{\color{red} o nome da função pode levar a confusão pois temos também o teste global pelo modelo de cox e pelo LR. Sugestão: AUC.test esta função pode proporcionar os resultados do teste local e global pelo método AUC.}

Results reported by the first command lines provide the probability values for the global test based on the AUC for the three transitions leaving State 1 (i.e.,$`<!-- -->`{=html}1$,$`<!-- -->`{=html}1$and$`<!-- -->`{=html}1$). As expected, a higher probability value was obtained for transition 1$$1 than the two remaining transitions, revealing evidence against the Markov condition. Results reported in the second set of input commands agree with previous findings, reporting a probability value of 0.006 for 2$$3. Among the objects saved by this function, \texorpdfstring%
{{\normalfont\ttfamily\hyphenchar\font=-1 AUC.test}}%
{AUC.test} displays the probability values for each percentile time (default to 5, 10, 20, 30, and 40) through the following codes:


%\begin{CodeInput}
\begin{example}
> round(res4$localTest,3) s 1-\>1 1-\>2 1-\>3 1 102.4 0.978 0.081 0.081

5 726.8   0.156  0.156
\end{example}
%\end{CodeInput}


These outputs show, for instance, that the probability value of the AUC local test reveal the fail of the Markovian assumption for the third percentile time ($p$-value < 0.001). Plots with the graphical local tests for the respective quantiles can be easily obtained using the following input commands:

%\begin{CodeInput}

%{\color{red} tal como apontado atras na funcao para o teste pelo modelo de cox, nao me parece boa ideia o argumento transition tal como esta pois o utilizador vai ter dificuldade em saber o que é a transição 3. Sugestão: transition="23" ou from=2, to=3.}

Often, multi-state models include covariates, and it may be the omission of covariate effects that induces apparent non-Markovianity. The methods proposed in this paper can also deal with this problem since discrete covariates can be included in the estimation of the transition probabilities$p\_hj(s,
t)$by splitting the sample for each level of the covariate and repeating the described procedures for each subsample. As an example, the following input codes show how to obtain the AUC global for individuals with the treatment `Obs’ of covariate `rx'. To this end, we start to filter the wide data set \texttt{colonMSM} and run the \texorpdfstring%
{{\normalfont\ttfamily\hyphenchar\font=-1 prepMSM}}%
{prepMSM} function to obtain the subgroups of the new data in the format long. At least, we just need to use the \texorpdfstring%
{{\normalfont\ttfamily\hyphenchar\font=-1 AUC.test}}%
{AUC.test} function for the specific transitions as follows:

\begin{example}
> db_wide_obs <- db_wide[db_wide$rx == 'Obs',\] \> db_long_obs \<-
prepMSM(data = db_wide_obs, trans, timesNames, status) \>
set.seed(12345) \> res4.obs \<- AUC.test(data = db_long_obs, times =

The [markovMSM](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=markovMSM) package
can also be used to compute the results of the global and local tests
proposed by [@Titman2020] which are based on log-rank statistics. A
summary of the arguments of the LR.test function is shown in
Table [2](#Tab4){reference-type="ref" reference="Tab4"}. The following
input commands illustrate the usage of LR.test function to implement
these tests:

As we can see, the probability value of the global tests based on the
log-rank statistics confirms the possible failure of Markovianity for
lower values of $s$ (P=0.047 \< 0.05).

## Tests for Markov assumption for more complex multi-state models {#sec:mkv tests1}

In this section, we use two data sets to illustrate the extension of the
previous functions to more complex multi-state models. As a first
example, we consider the data of 2279 patients transplanted by the
European Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation (EBMT) and, as a
second example, data from liver cirrhosis patients subjected to
prednisone treatment. Further details on the description of the data can
be found in [@Putter2007] and [@Andersen1993], respectively.

The steps taken in the analysis are quite similar to those introduced
for the illness-death model. To extend the proposed local and global
tests to more complex models, we make use of the LMAJ estimator that
produces consistent estimates of the transition probabilities in the
case of non-Markovianity of the process.

We start by considering the data set comprising 2279 patients who
suffered from blood cancers and who were treated at the EBMT between
1985 and 1998 after a transplant. The movement of the patients among the
six states can be modeled through the multi-state model with the
following six states: 'Alive and in remission, no recovery or adverse
event' (state 1); 'Alive in remission, recovered from the treatment'
(state 2); 'Alive in remission, occurrence of the adverse event' (state
3); 'Alive, both recovered and adverse event' (state 4); 'Alive, in
relapse' (treatment failure) (state 5) and 'Dead (treatment failure)'
(state 6). In total, there are 12 transitions: three intermediate events
given by recovery (Rec), adverse event (AE) and a combination of the two
(AE and Rec), and two absorbing states: relapse and death
(Figure [2](#fig9b){reference-type="ref" reference="fig9b"}).

Since the original data ebmt4 is in the wide format, before implementing
a global test we need to convert it into the long format using functions
transMatMSM, prepMSM before using function AUC.test with the argument
type='global':

:::

The interpretation of the output for the global test and for local tests
of the five percentile times is similar to that shown for the
illness-death model. Thus, object res7 is used to get a list with
components giving the probability values for the Markov test for all
transitions leaving State 1 (i.e., for 1$\rightarrow$ j with
$j\in \{1,2,3,4,5\}$). For instance, the probability value of 0.0094
corresponds to the result of the AUC global test for transition
1$\rightarrow$`<!-- -->`{=html}2, while 0.0147 is the probability value
for the local test, for $s=21$ for the same transition.

The proposed methods can also be used in reversible multi-state models
such as those applied to the data set of liver cirrhosis patients who
were included in a randomized clinical trial at several hospitals in
Copenhagen between 1962 and 1974. The study aimed to evaluate whether a
treatment based on prednisone prolongs survival for patients with
cirrhosis [@Andersen1993]. State 1 corresponds to 'normal prothrombin
level', State 2 to 'low (or abnormal) prothrombin level', and State 3 to
'dead'. The movement of the patients among these three states can be
modeled using the reversible illness-death model shown in
Figure [3](#fig9){reference-type="ref" reference="fig9"}. The input
commands for the local and global tests of the AUC and Log-rank tests
are presented as a vignette in the `markovMSM` package.

# Conclusions {#sec:conc}

This paper discusses the implementation in R of new methods for checking
the Markov assumption in multi-state models proposed by
[@soutinho_machado2020]. Instead of testing, as usual, the Markovianity
of the multi-state process by including covariates depending on the
history, [@soutinho_machado2020] propose global and local tests based on
the comparison between estimated transition probabilities. This can be
done by measuring the discrepancy between the Aalen-Johansen estimator,
which gives consistent estimators in Markov processes, and recent
approaches that do not rely on this assumption, given by the Landmark
and the Landmark Aalen-Johansen estimators.

The use of local tests is recommended whenever the goal is to estimate
the transition probabilities and, in particular, decide which estimator
is the most appropriate to use: the Aalen-Johansen estimator or a robust
estimator. A global test, such as the test proposed here, might be
preferable for regression purposes. To this end, a common simplifying
strategy is to decouple the whole process into various survival models.
Then, for all permitted transitions, the transition intensities may be
modeled using separate Cox models, assuming the process to be Markovian
(also known as the clock forward modeling approach). When the test
rejects the Markov assumption, one alternative approach is to use a
semi-Markov Cox model in which the future of the process does not depend
on the current time but rather on the duration of the current state.

A brief summary of the theory underlying these methods has been
provided, along with an extensive review of the current literature. A
detailed usage of the three main functions that compose the
[markovMSM](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=markovMSM) package,
AUC.test, LR.test and PHM.test are illustrated using three real data
sets: colonIDM, ebmt4 and prothr. Whereas the first data enables the
application of the Markov tests to an illness-death model, the last two
cases show how to extend the proposed methods to more complex
multi-state models (with more than three states or with reversible
transitions). The comparison of the proposed tests to the new methods
given by the log-rank test described by [@Titman2020] is also shown. We
also present approaches to validate the suspicion of the failure of the
Markovianity of the process using graphical tests. The
[markovMSM](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=markovMSM) package is
available at the first author's GitHub repository as well as the CRAN
repository at https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/markovMSM. Further
details on the usage of its functions can be obtained from the
corresponding help pages.
