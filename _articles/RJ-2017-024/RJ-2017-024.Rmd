title: 'The mosaic Package: Helping Students to Think with Data Using R'
abstract: The mosaic package provides a simplified and systematic introduction to
  the core functional ity related to descriptive statistics, visualization, modeling,
  and simulation-based inference required in first and second courses in statistics.
  This introduction to the package describes some of the guiding principles behind
  the design of the package and provides illustrative examples of several of the most
  important functions it implements. These can be combined to help students â€œthink
  with data" using R in their early course work, starting with simple, yet powerful,
  declarative commands.
