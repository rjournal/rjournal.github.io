title: 'mtk: A General-Purpose and Extensible R Environment for Uncertainty and Sensitivity
  Analyses of Numerical Experiments'
abstract: Along with increased complexity of the models used for scientific activities
  and engineering come diverse and greater uncertainties. Today, effectively quantifying
  the uncertainties contained in a model appears to be more important than ever. Scientific
  fellows know how serious it is to calibrate their model in a robust way, and decision-makers
  describe how critical it is to keep the best effort to reduce the uncertainties
  about the model. Effectively accessing the uncertainties about the model requires
  mastering all the tasks involved in the numerical experiments, from optimizing the
  experimental design to managing the very time consuming aspect of model simulation
  and choosing the adequate indicators and analysis methods. In this paper, we present
  an open framework for organizing the complexity associated with numerical model
  simulation and analyses. Named mtk (Mexico Toolkit), the developed system aims at
  providing practitioners from different disciplines with a systematic and easy way
  to compare and to find the best method to effectively uncover and quantify the uncertainties
  contained in the model and further to evaluate their impact on the performance of
  the model. Such requirements imply that the system must be generic, universal, homogeneous,
  and extensible. This paper discusses such an implementation using the R scientific
  computing platform and demonstrates its functionalities with examples from agricultural
  modeling. The package mtk is of general purpose and easy to extend. Numerous methods
  are already available in the actual release version, including Fast, Sobol, Morris,
  Basic Monte-Carlo, Regression, LHS (Latin Hypercube Sampling), PLMM (Polynomial
  Linear metamodel). Most of them are compiled from available R packages with extension
  tools delivered by package mtk.
