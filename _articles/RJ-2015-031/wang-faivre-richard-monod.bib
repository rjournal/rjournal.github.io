                  agricultural systems are available in the
                  literature. At this scale, landscape connectivity
                  measures how the landscape structure facilitates or
                  impedes the disease spread among host patches. We
                  developed a simulation model, giving a particular
                  attention to the representation of the landscape
                  structures, and we characterized the landscape
                  connectivity by the proportion and the aggregation
                  level of the host varieties, the ability for the
                  pathogen to develop on each host and its ability to
                  disperse. The pathogen dynamics was represented by a
                  matrix population model designed for a generic
                  air-borne foliar disease. This framework was used to
                  establish a detailed assessment of the influence of
                  each landscape connectivity variable on the pathogen
                  population dynamics. When deploying a host with
                  complete resistance to the pathogen along with a
                  susceptible host, mixed landscapes were always found
                  to be more efficient to hamper the disease
                  spread. However, when using a quantitatively
                  resistant host, aggregating the hosts in different
                  regions could result in a better control of the
                  pathogen spread, depending on the proportion and
                  level of resistance of the resistant host and
                  according to a source–sink dynamics between the two
                  hosts. The ability of the pathogen to disperse did
                  not change the results from a qualitative point of
                  view. By accounting explicitly for the landscape
                  features, our approach can be used to guide further
                  data analysis or to evaluate the effectiveness of
                  control strategies designed at the landscape
                  scale. "

                  models of biological systems is often complicated by
                  the presence of uncertainties in experimental data
                  that are used to estimate parameter values. Current
                  mathematical modeling approaches typically use
                  either single-parameter or local sensitivity
                  analyses. However, these methods do not accurately
                  assess uncertainty and sensitivity in the system as,
                  by default, they hold all other parameters fixed at
                  baseline values. Using techniques described within
                  we demonstrate how a multi-dimensional parameter
                  space can be studied globally so all uncertainties
                  can be identified. Further, uncertainty and
                  sensitivity analysis techniques can help to identify
                  and ultimately control uncertainties. In this work
                  we develop methods for applying existing analytical
                  tools to perform analyses on a variety of
                  mathematical and computer models. We compare two
                  specific types of global sensitivity analysis
                  indexes that have proven to be among the most robust
                  and efficient. Through familiar and new examples of
                  mathematical and computer models, we provide a
                  complete methodology for performing these analyses,
                  in both deterministic and stochastic settings, and
                  propose novel techniques to handle problems
                  encountered during these types of analyses. "

                  of outputs. In particular, sensitivity indices can
                  be used to infer which input parameters most
                  significantly affect the results of a computational
                  model. With continually increasing computing power,
                  sensitivity analysis has become an important
                  technique by which to understand the behavior of
                  large-scale computer simulations. Many sensitivity
                  analysis methods rely on sampling from distributions
                  of the inputs. Such sampling-based methods can be
                  computationally expensive, requiring many
                  evaluations of the simulation; in this case, the
                  Sobol' method provides an easy and accurate way to
                  compute variance-based measures, provided a
                  sufficient number of model evaluations are
                  available. As an alternative, meta-modeling
                  approaches have been devised to approximate the
                  response surface and estimate various measures of
                  sensitivity. In this work, we consider a variety of
                  sensitivity analysis methods, including different
                  sampling strategies, different meta-models, and
                  different ways of evaluating variance-based
                  sensitivity indices. The problem we consider is the
                  1-D Riemann problem. By a careful choice of inputs,
                  discontinuous solutions are obtained, leading to
                  discontinuous response surfaces; such surfaces can
                  be particularly problematic for meta-modeling
                  approaches. The goal of this study is to compare the
                  estimated sensitivity indices with exact values and
                  to evaluate the convergence of these estimates with
                  increasing samples sizes and under an increasing
                  number of meta-model evaluations. "
