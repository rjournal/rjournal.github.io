title: Splinets -- Orthogonal Splines for Functional Data Analysis
abstract: |
  This study introduces an efficient workflow for functional data
  analysis in classification problems, utilizing advanced orthogonal
  spline bases. The methodology is based on the flexible Splinets
  package, featuring a novel spline representation designed for enhanced
  data efficiency. The focus here is to show that the novel features
  make the package a powerful and efficient tool for advanced functional
  data analysis. Two main aspects of spline implemented in the package
  are behind this effectiveness: 1) Utilization of Orthonormal Spline
  Bases -- the workflow incorporates orthonormal spline bases, known as
  splinets, ensuring a robust foundation for data representation; 2)
  Consideration of Spline Support Sets -- the implemented spline object
  representation accounts for spline support sets, which refines the
  accuracy of sparse data representation. Particularly noteworthy are
  the improvements achieved in scenarios where data sparsity and
  dimension reduction are critical factors. The computational engine of
  the package is the dyadic orthonormalization of B-splines that leads
  the so-called splinets -- the efficient orthonormal basis of splines
  spanned over arbitrarily distributed knots. Importantly, the locality
  of $B$-splines concerning support sets is preserved in the
  corresponding splinet. This allows for the mathematical elegance of
  the data representation in an orthogonal basis. However, if one wishes
  to traditionally use the $B$-splines it is equally easy and efficient
  because all the computational burden is then carried in the background
  by the splinets. Using the locality of the orthogonal splinet, along
  with implemented algorithms, the functional data classification
  workflow is presented in a case study in which the classic Fashion
  MINST dataset is used. Significant efficiency gains obtained by
  utilization of the package are highlighted including functional data
  representation through stable and efficient computations of the
  functional principal components. Several examples based on classical
  functional data sets, such as the wine data set, showing the
  convenience and elegance of working with Splinets are included as
  well.
