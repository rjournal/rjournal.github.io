@article{Basna:2024aa,
	abstract = {Functional data analysis is typically performed in two steps: first, functionally representing discrete observations, and then applying functional methods to the so-represented data. The initial choice of a functional representation may have a significant impact on the second phase of the analysis, as shown in recent research, where data-driven spline bases outperformed the predefined rigid choice of functional representation. The method chooses an initial functional basis by an efficient placement of the knots using a simple machine-learning algorithm. The knot selection approach does not apply directly when the data are defined on domains of a higher dimension than one such as, for example, images. The reason is that in higher dimensions the convenient and numerically efficient spline spaces use tensor bases that require knots located on a lattice. This fundamentally limits flexible knot placement which is fundamental for the approach. The goal of this research is two-fold: first, to propose modified approaches that circumvent the issue by coding the irregular knot selection into the topology of the spaces of tensor-based splines; second, to apply the approach to a classification problem workflow for functional data that utilizes knot selection. The performance is preliminarily accessed on a benchmark dataset and shown to be comparable to or better than the previous methods.},

@article{Petricoin:2002aa,
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: New technologies for the detection of early-stage ovarian cancer are urgently needed. Pathological changes within an organ might be reflected in proteomic patterns in serum. We developed a bioinformatics tool and used it to identify proteomic patterns in serum that distinguish neoplastic from non-neoplastic disease within the ovary. METHODS: Proteomic spectra were generated by mass spectroscopy (surface-enhanced laser desorption and ionisation). A preliminary "training" set of spectra derived from analysis of serum from 50 unaffected women and 50 patients with ovarian cancer were analysed by an iterative searching algorithm that identified a proteomic pattern that completely discriminated cancer from non-cancer. The discovered pattern was then used to classify an independent set of 116 masked serum samples: 50 from women with ovarian cancer, and 66 from unaffected women or those with non-malignant disorders. FINDINGS: The algorithm identified a cluster pattern that, in the training set, completely segregated cancer from non-cancer. The discriminatory pattern correctly identified all 50 ovarian cancer cases in the masked set, including all 18 stage I cases. Of the 66 cases of non-malignant disease, 63 were recognised as not cancer. This result yielded a sensitivity of 100% (95% CI 93--100), specificity of 95% (87--99), and positive predictive value of 94% (84--99). INTERPRETATION: These findings justify a prospective population-based assessment of proteomic pattern technology as a screening tool for all stages of ovarian cancer in high-risk and general populations.},

In particular, a Slepian model for the noise --the Slepian noise --is developed. For Laplace moving average process a method of sampling from the Slepian noise is also obtained by a Gibbs sampler. This facilitates comparison of behavior at crossing of a level between a gaussian process and a non-gaussian one and allows to study a random processes sampled at crossings of a non-gaussian moving average process. In a numerical study based on the method it is observed that the behavior of a non-gaussian moving average process at high level crossings is fundamentally different from that for the gaussian case, which is in line with some recent theoretical results on the subject.},

@article{LIU2022,
	abstract = {A dyadic algorithm for diagonalizing an arbitrary positive definite band matrix, referred to as a band Gramian, is obtained to efficiently orthogonalize the B-splines. The algorithm can be also used as a fast inversion method for a band Gramian characterized by remarkable sparsity of the diagonalizing matrix. There are two versions of the algorithm: the first one is more efficient and is applicable to a Toeplitz band Gramian while the second one is more general, works with any Gramian matrix, but is more computationally intensive. In the context of the B-splines, these two cases result in new symmetric orthogonalization procedures and correspond to equally and arbitrarily spaced knots, respectively. In the algorithm, the sparsity of a band Gramian is utilized to produce a natural dyadic net of orthogonal splines, rather than a sequence of them. Such a net is thus naturally referred to as a splinet. The splinets exploit ``near-orthogonalization'' of the B-splines and feature locality expressed through a small size of the total support set and computational efficiency that is a result of a small number of inner product evaluations needed for their construction. These and other efficiencies are formally quantified by upper bounds and asymptotic rates with respect to the number of splines in a splinet. An additional assessment is provided through numerical experiments. They suggest that the theoretical bounds are rather conservative and the method is even more efficient than the bounds indicate. The dyadic net-like structures and the locality bear some resemblance to wavelets but in fact, the splinets are fundamentally different because they do not aim at capturing the resolution scales. The orthogonalization method together with efficient spline algebra and calculus has been implemented in R-package Splinets available on CRAN.},
