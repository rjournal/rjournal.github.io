title: 'ClustVarLV: An R Package for the Clustering of Variables Around Latent Variables'
abstract: The clustering of variables is a strategy for deciphering the underlying
  structure of a data set. Adopting an exploratory data analysis point of view, the
  Clustering of Variables around Latent Variables (CLV) approach has been proposed
  by Vigneau and Qannari (2003). Based on a family of optimization criteria, the CLV
  approach is adaptable to many situations. In particular, constraints may be introduced
  in order to take account of additional information about the observations and/or
  the variables. In this paper, the CLV method is depicted and the R package ClustVarLV
  including a set of functions developed so far within this framework is introduced.
  Considering successively different types of situations, the underlying CLV criteria
  are detailed and the various functions of the package are illustrated using real
  case studies.
