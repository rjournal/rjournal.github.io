title: 'Peptides: A Package for Data Mining of Antimicrobial Peptides'
abstract: Antimicrobial peptides (AMP) are a promising source of antibiotics with
  a broad spectrum activity against bacteria and low incidence of developing resistance.
  The mechanism by which an AMP executes its function depends on a set of computable
  physicochemical properties from the amino acid sequence. The Peptides package was
  designed to allow the quick and easy computation of ten structural characteristics
  own of the antimicrobial peptides, with the aim of generating data to increase the
  accuracy in classification and design of new amino acid sequences. Moreover, the
  options to read and plot XVG output files from GROMACS molecular dynamics package
  are included.
