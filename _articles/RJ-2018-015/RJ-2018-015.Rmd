title: 'MGLM: An R Package for Multivariate Categorical Data Analysis'
abstract: Data with multiple responses is ubiquitous in modern applications. However,
  few tools are available for regression analysis of multivariate counts. The most
  popular multinomial-logit model has a very restrictive mean-variance structure,
  limiting its applicability to many data sets. This article introduces an R package
  MGLM, short for multivariate response generalized linear models, that expands the
  current tools for regression analysis of polytomous data. Distribution fitting,
  random number generation, regression, and sparse regression are treated in a unifying
  framework. The algorithm, usage, and implementation details are discussed.
