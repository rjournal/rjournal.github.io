title: 'jsr223: A Java Platform Integration for R with Programming Languages Groovy,
  JavaScript, JRuby, Jython, and Kotlin'
abstract: 'The R package jsr223 is a high-level integration for five programming languages
  in the Java platform: Groovy, JavaScript, JRuby, Jython, and Kotlin. Each of these
  languages can use Java objects in their own syntax. Hence, jsr223 is also an integration
  for R and the Java platform. It enables developers to leverage Java solutions from
  within R by embedding code snippets or evaluating script files. This approach is
  generally easier than rJava’s low-level approach that employs the Java Native Interface.
  jsr223’s multi-language support is dependent on the Java Scripting API: an implementation
  of “JSR-223: Scripting for the Java Platform” that defines a framework to embed
  scripts in Java applications. The jsr223 package also features extensive data exchange
  capabilities and a callback interface that allows embedded scripts to access the
  current R session. In all, jsr223 makes solutions developed in Java or any of the
  jsr223-supported languages easier to use in R.'
