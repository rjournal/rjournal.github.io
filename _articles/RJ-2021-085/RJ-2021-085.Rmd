title: 'spfilteR: An R package for Semiparametric Spatial Filtering with Eigenvectors
  in (Generalized) Linear Models'
abstract: Eigenvector-based Spatial filtering constitutes a highly flexible semiparametric
  approach to account for spatial autocorrelation in a regression framework. It combines
  judiciously selected eigenvectors from a transformed connectivity matrix to construct
  a synthetic spatial filter and remove spatial patterns from model residuals. This
  article introduces the spfilteR package that provides several useful and flexible
  tools to estimate spatially filtered linear and generalized linear models in R.
  While the package features functions to identify relevant eigenvectors based on
  different selection criteria in an unsupervised fashion, it also helps users to
  perform supervised spatial filtering and to select eigenvectors based on alternative
  user-defined criteria. Besides a brief discussion of the eigenvector-based spatial
  filtering approach, this article presents the main functions of the package and
  illustrates their usage. Comparison to alternative implementations in other R packages
  highlights the added value of the spfilteR package.
