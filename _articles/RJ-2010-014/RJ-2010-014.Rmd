title: Bayesian Estimation of the GARCH(1,1) Model with Student-t Innovations
abstract: This note presents the R package bayesGARCH which provides functions for
  the Bayesian estimation of the parsimonious and effective GARCH(1,1) model with
  Student-t innovations. The estimation procedure is fully automatic and thus avoids
  the tedious task of tuning an MCMC sampling algorithm. The usage of the package
  is shown in an empirical application to exchange rate log-returns.
