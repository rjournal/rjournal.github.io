::: article
CRAN packages are tested regularly on both Linux and Solaris. The
results of these tests can be found at
<http://cran.r-project.org/web/checks/check_summary.html>. Currently, 24
packages generate errors on Linux while 125 packages generate errors on
Solaris.[^1] A major contribution to the higher frequency of errors on
Solaris is lack of portability of C++ code. The CRAN Solaris checks use
the Oracle Solaris Studio 12.2 compiler, which has a much more stringent
interpretation of the C++ standard than the GCC 4.6.1 compiler used for
the checks on on Linux, and will therefore reject code that compiles
correctly with GCC.

It seems plausible that most R package developers work with GCC and are
therefore not aware of portability issues in their C++ code until these
are shown by the CRAN checks on Solaris. In fact, many of the testing
errors are due to a few commonly recurring problems in C++. The aims of
this article are to describe these problems, to help package authors
diagnose them from the Solaris error message, and to suggest good
practice for avoiding them.

The scope of the article is limited to basic use of C++. It does not
cover the use of the [*Rcpp*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=Rcpp)
package [@Eddelbuettel:Francois:2011] and the Scythe statistical library
[@Pemstein:Quinn:Martin:2007], which are used to support C++ code in
some R packages, nor issues involved in writing your own templates.

Before describing the portability issues in detail, it is important to
consider two general principles that underlie most portability problems.

Firstly, *C++ is not a superset of C*. The current C standard is ISO/IEC
9899:1999, usually referred to as C99 after its year of publication.
Most C++ compilers support the ISO/IEC 14882:1998 (C++98), which
predates it.[^2] Thus, the two languages have diverged, and there are
features in C99 that are not available in C++98.

The g++ compiler allows C99 features in C++ code. These features will
not be accepted by other compilers that adhere more closely to the C++98
standard. If your code uses C99 features, then it is not portable.

The C++ standard is evolving. In August 2011, the ISO approved a new C++
standard which was published in September 2011 and is known as C++11.
This should remove much of the divergence between the two languages.
However, it may take some time for the new C++11 standard to be widely
implemented in C++ compilers and libraries. Therefore this article was
written with C++98 in mind.

The second general issue is that g++ has a permissive interpretation of
the C++ standard, and will typically interpret ambiguous code for you.
Other compilers require stricter conformance to the standard and will
need hints for interpreting ambiguous code. Unlike the first issue, this
is unlikely to change with the evolving C++ standard.

The following sections each describe a specific issue that leads to C++
portability problems. By far the most common error message produced on
Solaris is 'The function `foo` must have a prototype'. In the following,
this is referred to as a missing prototype error. Problems and solutions
are illustrated using C++ code snippets. In order to keep the examples
short, ellipses are used in place of code that is not strictly necessary
to illustrate the problem.

# C99 functions

Table 1 shows some C functions that were introduced with the C99
standard and are not supported by C++98. These functions are accepted by
g++ and will therefore pass R package checks using this compiler, but
will fail on Solaris with a missing prototype error.

  ------------------------------
  C99 Function   R replacement
  -------------- ---------------
  expm1(x)       expm1(x)

  log1p(x)       log1p(x)

  trunc(x)       ftrunc(x)

  round(x)       fprec(x, 0)

  lgamma(x)      lgammafn(x)
  ------------------------------

  : Table 1: Some expressions using C99 functions and their portable
  replacements using functions declared in the `<Rmath.h>`

R packages have access to C functions exposed by the R API, which
provides a simple workaround for these functions. All of the expressions
in the left hand column of Table 1 can be replaced by portable
expressions on the right hand side if the header `<Rmath.h>` is
included.

A less frequently used C99 function is the cube root function `cbrt`.
The expression `cbrt(x)` can be replaced by `std::pow(x, (1./3.))` using
the `pow` function defined in the header `<cmath>`.

# C99 macros for special values

The C99 standard also introduced the constants `NAN` and `INFINITY` as
well as the macros `isfinite`, `isinf`, `isnan` and `fpclassify` to test
for them. None of these are part of the C++98 standard. Attempts to use
the macros on Solaris will result in a missing prototype error, and the
constants will result in the error message "NAN/INFINITY not defined".

As with the C99 functions above, the R API provides some facilities to
replace this missing functionality. The R macros `R_FINITE` and `ISNAN`
and the R function `R_IsNan` are described in the R manual "Writing R
Extensions" and are accessed by including the header file `<R.h>`. They
are not exactly equivalent to the C99 macros because they are adapted to
deal with R's missing value `NA_REAL`.

If you need access to a non-finite value then `<R_ext/Arith.h>` provides
`R_PosInf`, `R_NegInf` and `R_NaReal` (more commonly used as `NA_REAL`).

# Variable-length arrays

A variable-length array is created when the size of the array is
determined at runtime, not compile time. A simple example is

``` r
void fun(int n) \{
   double A[n];
   ...
\}
```

Variable length arrays are not part of the C++98 standard. On Solaris,
they produce the error message "An integer constant expression is
required within the array subscript operator".

Variable-length arrays can be replaced by an instantiation of the
`vector` template from the Standard Template Library (STL). Elements of
an STL vector are accessed using square bracket notation just like
arrays, so it suffices to replace the definition of the array with

``` r
std::vector<double> A(n);
```

The STL `vector` template includes a destructor that will free the
memory when `A` goes out of scope.

A function that accepts a pointer to the beginning of an array can be
modified to accept a reference to an STL vector. For example, this

``` r
void fun(double *A, unsigned int length) \{ ... \}
```

may be replaced with

``` r
void fun(std::vector<double> &A) \{ 
   unsigned int length = A.size();
   ...
\}
```

Note that an STL vector can be queried to determine its size. Hence the
size does not need to be passed as an additional argument.

External library functions that expect a pointer to a C array, such as
BLAS or LAPACK routines, may also be used with STL vectors. The C++
standard guarantees that the elements of a `vector` are stored
contiguously. The address of the first element (*e.g.* `&a[0]`) is thus
a pointer to the start of an underlying C array that can be passed to
external functions. For example:

``` r
int n = 20;
std::vector<double> a(n);
...   // fill in a
double nrm2 = cblas\_dnrm2(n, \&a[0], 1);
```

Note however that boolean vectors are an exception to this rule. They
may be packed to save memory, so it is not safe to assume a one-to-one
correspondence between the underlying storage of a boolean `vector` and
a boolean array.

# Function overloading

The C++ standard library provides overloaded versions of most
mathematical functions, with versions that accept (and return) a
`float`, `double` or `long double`.

If an integer constant is passed to these functions, then g++ will
decide for you which of the overloaded functions to use. For example,
this expression is accepted by g++.

``` r
#include <cmath>
using std::sqrt;

double z = sqrt(2);
```

The Oracle Solaris Studio compiler will produce the error message
'Overloading ambiguity between `std::sqrt(double)` and
`std::sqrt(float)`'. It requires a hint about which version to use. This
hint can be supplied by ensuring that the constant is interpreted as a
double

``` r
double z = sqrt(2.);
```

In this case `2.` is a double constant, rather than an integer, because
it includes a decimal point. To use a `float` or `long double`, add the
qualifying suffix `F` or `L` respectively.

The same error message arises when an integer variable is passed to an
overloaded function inside an expression that does not evaluate to a
floating point number.

``` r
#include <cmath>
using std::sqrt;

bool fun(int n, int m) \{
   return n > m * sqrt(m);
\}
```

In this example, the compiler does not know if `m` should be considered
a `float`, `double` or `long double` inside the `sqrt` function because
the return type is `bool`. The hint can be supplied using a cast:

``` r
   return n > m * sqrt(static\_cast<double>(m));
```

# Namespaces for C functions

As noted above, C99 functions are not part of the C++98 standard. C
functions from the previous C90 standard are allowed in C++98 code, but
their use is complicated by the issue of namespaces. This is a common
cause of missing prototype errors on Solaris.

The C++ standard library offers two distinct sets of header files for
C90 functions. One set is called `<cname>` and the other is called
`<name.h>` where "name" is the base name of the header (*e.g.* `math`,
`stdio`, ...). It should be noted that the `<name.h>` headers in the C++
standard library are *not* the same files as their namesakes provided by
the C standard library.

Both sets of header files in the C++ standard library provide the same
declarations and definitions, but differ according to whether they
provide them in the standard namespace or the global namespace. The
namespace determines the function calling convention that must be used:

-   Functions in the standard namespace need to be referred to by
    prefixing `std::` to the function name. Alternatively, in source
    files (but not header files) the directive `using std::foo;` may be
    used at the beginning of the file to instruct the compiler that
    `foo` always refers to a function in the standard namespace.

-   Functions in the global namespace can be referred to without any
    prefix, except when the function is overloaded in another namespace.
    In this case the scope resolution prefix `::` must be used. For
    example:

``` r
using std::vector;

namespace mypkg \{
   //Declare overloaded sqrt
   vector<double> sqrt(vector<double> const &);
   //Use sqrt in global namespace
   double y = ::sqrt(2.0);
\}
```

Although the C++98 standard specifies which namespaces the headers
`<cname>` and `<name.h>` should use, it has not been widely followed. In
fact, the C++11 standard has been modified to conform to the current
behaviour of C++ compilers [@n3242 Appendix D.5], namely:

-   Header `<cname>` provides declarations and definitions in the
    namespace `std`. It may or may not provide them in the global
    namespace.

-   Header `<name.h>` provides declarations and definitions in the
    global namespace. It may or may not provide them in the namespace
    `std`.

The permissiveness of this standard makes it difficult to test code for
portability. If you use the `<cname>` headers, then g++ puts functions
in both the standard and global namespaces, so you may freely mix the
two calling conventions. However, the Oracle Solaris Studio compiler
will reject C function calls that are not resolved to the standard
namespace.

The key to portability of C functions in C++ code is to use one set of C
headers consistently and check the code on a platform that does not use
both namespaces at the same time. This rules out g++ for testing code
with the `<cname>` headers. Conversely, the GNU C++ standard library
header `<name.h>` does not put functions in the `std` namespace, so g++
may be used to test code using `<name.h>` headers. This is far from an
ideal solution. These headers were meant to simplify porting of C code
to C++ and are not supposed to be used for new C++ code. However, the
fact that the C++11 standard still includes these deprecated headers
suggests a tacit acceptance that their use is still widespread.

# Some g++ shortcuts

The g++ compiler provides two further shortcuts for the programmer which
may occasionally throw up missing prototype errors on Solaris.

Headers in the GNU C++ standard library may be implicitly included in
other headers. For example, in version 4.5.1, the `<fstream>` and
`<stdexcept>` headers both include the `<string>` header. If your source
file includes either of these two headers, then you may may use strings
without an `#include <string>;` statement, relying on this implicit
inclusion. Other implementations of the C++ standard library may not do
this implicit inclusion.

When faced with a missing prototype error on Solaris, it is worth
checking a suitable reference (such as <http://www.cplusplus.com>) to
find out which header declares the function according to the C++
standard, and then ensure that this header is explicitly included in
your code.

A second shortcut provided by g++ is argument-dependent name lookup
(also known as Koenig lookup), which may allow you to omit scope
resolution of functions in the standard namespace. For example,

``` r
#include <algorithm>
#include <vector>
using std::vector;

void fun (vector<double> &y)
\{
   sort(y.begin(), y.end());
\}
```

Since the arguments to the `sort` algorithm are in the `std` namespace,
gcc looks in the same namespace for a definition of `sort`. This code
therefore compiles correctly with gcc. Compilers that do not support
Koenig lookup require the `sort` function to be resolved as `std::sort`.

# Conclusions

The best way to check for portability of C++ code is simply to test it
with as many compilers on as many platforms as possible. On Linux,
various third-party commercial compilers are available at zero cost. The
Intel C++ Composer XE compiler is free for non-commercial software
development (Note that you must comply with Intel's definition of
non-commercial); the PathScale EkoPath 4 compiler recently became open
source; the Oracle Solaris Studio compilers may be downloaded for free
from the Oracle web site (subject to license terms). The use of these
alternative compilers should help to detect problems not detected by
GCC, although it may not uncover all portability issues since they also
rely on the GNU implementation of the C++ standard library. It is also
possible to set up alternate testing platforms inside a virtual machine,
although the details of this are beyond the scope of this article.

Recognizing that most R package authors do not have the time to set up
their own testing platforms, this article should help them to interpret
the feedback from the CRAN tests on Solaris, which provide a rigorous
test of conformity to the current C++ standard. Much of the advice in
this article also applies to a C++ front-end or an external library to
which an R package may be linked.

An important limitation of this article is the assumption that package
authors are free to modify the source code. In fact, many R packages are
wrappers around code written by a third party. Of course, all CRAN
packages published under an open source license may be modified
according to the licence conditions. However, some of the solutions
proposed here, such as using functions from the R API, may not be
suitable for third-party code as they require maintaining a patched
copy. Nevertheless, it may still be useful to send feedback to the
upstream maintainer.
