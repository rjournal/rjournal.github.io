title: 'QCA: A Package for Qualitative Comparative Analysis'
abstract: We present QCA, a package for performing Qualitative Comparative Analysis
  (QCA). QCA is becoming increasingly popular with social scientists, but none of
  the existing software alternatives covers the full range of core procedures. This
  gap is now filled by QCA. After a mapping of the method’s diffusion, we introduce
  some of the package’s main capabilities, including the calibration of crisp and
  fuzzy sets, the analysis of necessity relations, the construction of truth tables
  and the derivation of complex, parsimonious and intermediate solutions.
