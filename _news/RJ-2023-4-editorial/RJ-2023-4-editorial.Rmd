On behalf of the editorial board, I am pleased to present Volume 15 Issue 4 of the R Journal. 

This is my last issue as Editor-in-Chief. Mark van der Loo takes over as Editor-in-Chief for 2024, having served as an Executive Editor since 2022 and as Associate Editor since 2021.

Catherine Hurley recently finished her Editorial board term. She has been leading the expansion to four issues a year as the first Editor-in-Chief to oversee the process, and worked tirelessly to reduce the turn-around times despite an increasing numer of submissions.

The articles in this issue have been carefully copy edited by Adam Bartonicek, Chase Robertson and Taylor Lee.
