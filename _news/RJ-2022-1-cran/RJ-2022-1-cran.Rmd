::: article
In the past 3 months, 617 new packages were added to the CRAN package
repository. 86 packages were unarchived and 307 were archived. The
following shows the growth of the number of active packages in the CRAN
package repository:

On 2022-03-31, the number of active packages was around 18924.

## Changes in the CRAN Repository Policy

The [Policy](https://CRAN.R-project.org/web/packages/policies.html) now
says the following:

-   (**Using external C/C++/Fortran libraries.**) Where a package wishes
    to make use of a library not written solely for the package, the
    package installation should first look to see if it is already
    installed and if so is of a suitable version. In case not, it is
    desirable to include the library sources in the package and compile
    them as part of package installation. If the sources are too large,
    it is acceptable to download them as part of installation, but do
    ensure that the download is of a fixed version rather than the
    latest. Only as a last resort and with the agreement of the CRAN
    team should a package download pre-compiled software.
    On Windows and macOS static libraries must be used. A separate
    document, [External Libraries for CRAN
    packages](https://CRAN.R-project.org/web/packages/external_libs.html),
    covers what external libraries are or could be made available.

## CRAN package submissions

During the first 4 months of 2022 (January 2022 to April 2022), CRAN
received 9601 package submissions. For these, 17170 actions took place
of which 11232 (65%) were auto processed actions and 5938 (35%) manual
actions.

Minus some special cases, a summary of the auto-processed and manually
triggered actions follows:

  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
             archive   inspect   newbies   pending   pretest   publish   recheck   waiting
  -------- --------- --------- --------- --------- --------- --------- --------- ---------
  auto          2391      2716      1392         0         0      3018      1017       698

  manual        1893        93       487       323       106      2232       637       167
  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  : 

These include the final decisions for the submissions which were

  --------------------------------------
  action          archive        publish
  -------- -------------- --------------
  auto       2232 (23.9%)   2479 (26.5%)

  manual     1870 (20.0%)   2758 (29.5%)
  --------------------------------------

  : 

where we only count those as *auto* processed whose publication or
rejection happened automatically in all steps.

A new team member, Viktoria Wimmer, joined the CRAN submission team.
Welcome, Viktoria. Unfortunately, Julia Haider left the CRAN submission
team after processing 3517 incoming submissions. Thanks a lot!

## CRAN mirror security

Currently, there are 102 official CRAN mirrors, 81 of which provide both
secure downloads via `https` *and* use secure mirroring from the CRAN
master (via rsync through ssh tunnels). Since the R 3.4.0 release,
`chooseCRANmirror()` offers these mirrors in preference to the others
which are not fully secured (yet).

## CRAN Task View Initiative

The transition of the established task views to the new workflow on
GitHub (<https://github.com/cran-task-views/ctv/>) that was announced in
the previous volume of the journal has been completed (see also
<https://twitter.com/AchimZeileis/status/1510945091980038145>).

Each task view now links to a GitHub repository where it is possible to
post issues and make pull requests for proposing improvements -- in
addition to sending e-mails to the maintainer address which is still
possible, of course. Moreover, the task view web pages contain further
improvements like a citation, installation notes, and a streamlined
overview of core and regular (and currently archived) packages in the
task view.

Proposals of new task views are now also possible on GitHub. In fact, a
few have already been made for the topics causal inference, genetics and
genomics (as a follow-up to the orphaned and archived *Genetics* and
*Phylogenetics* views), and sports analytics.

We look forward to further user contributions to the initiative!
