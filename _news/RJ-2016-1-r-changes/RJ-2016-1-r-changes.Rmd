CHANGES IN R 3.3.1 patched

::: subsection
NEW FEATURES

-   `extSoftVersion()` now reports the version (if any) of the
    `readline` library in use.

-   Convenience function `hasName()` has been added; it is intended to
    replace the common idiom `!is.null(x$name)` without the usually
    unintended partial name matching.

-   The version of LAPACK included in the sources has been updated to
    3.6.1, a bug-fix release including a speedup for the non-symmetric
    case of `eigen()`.

-   Use `options(deparse.max.lines)` to limit the number of lines
    recorded in .Traceback and other deparsing activities.
:::

::: subsection
INSTALLATION and INCLUDED SOFTWARE

-   Versions of the `readline` library \>= 6.3 had been changed so that
    terminal window resizes were not signalled to `readline`: code has
    been added using a explicit signal handler to work around that (when
    R is compiled against readline \>= 6.3).
    ([PR#16604](https://bugs.R-project.org/bugzilla3/show_bug.cgi?id=16604))

-   `configure` works better with Oracle Developer Studio 12.5.
:::

::: subsection
UTILITIES

-   `R CMD check` reports more dubious flags in files
    `src/Makevars[.in]`, including `-w` and `-g`.

-   `R CMD check` has been set up to filter important warnings from
    recent versions of `gfortran` with `-Wall -pedantic`: this now
    reports non-portable GNU extensions such as out-of-order
    declarations.
:::

::: subsection
BUG FIXES

-   The check for non-portable flags in `R CMD check` could be stymied
    by `src/Makevars` files which contained targets.

-   (Windows only) When using certain desktop themes in Windows 7 or
    higher, could cause `Rterm` to stop accepting input.
    ([PR#14406](https://bugs.R-project.org/bugzilla3/show_bug.cgi?id=14406);
    patch submitted by Jan Gleixner.)

-   `pretty(d, ..)` behaves better for date-time `d`
    ([PR#16923](https://bugs.R-project.org/bugzilla3/show_bug.cgi?id=16923)).

-   When a class name matches multiple classes in the cache, perform a
    dynamic search in order to obey namespace imports. This should
    eliminate annoying messages about multiple hits in the class cache.
    Also, pass along the package from the `ClassExtends` object when
    looking up superclasses in the cache.

-   `sample(NA_real_)` now works.

-   Packages using non-ASCII encodings in their code did not install
    data properly on systems using different encodings.

-   `merge(df1, df2)` now also works for data frames with column names
    `"na.last"`, `"decreasing"`, or `"method"`.
    ([PR#17119](https://bugs.R-project.org/bugzilla3/show_bug.cgi?id=17119))

-   `contour()` caused a segfault if the `labels` argument had length
    zero. (Reported by Bill Dunlap.)

-   `unique(warnings())` works more correctly, thanks to a new
    `duplicated.warnings()` method.

-   `findInterval(x, vec = numeric(), all.inside = TRUE)` now returns
    `0`s as documented. (Reported by Bill Dunlap.)

-   (Windows only) `R CMD SHLIB` failed when a symbol in the resulting
    library had the same name as a keyword in the `.def` file.
    ([PR#17130](https://bugs.R-project.org/bugzilla3/show_bug.cgi?id=17130))

-   `pmax()` and `pmin()` now work with (more ?) classed objects, such
    as `"Matrix"` from the
    [*Matrix*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=Matrix) package, as
    documented for a long time.

-   `axis(side, x = D)` and hence `Axis()` and `plot()` now work
    correctly for `"Date"` and time objects `D`, even when "time goes
    backward", e.g., with decreasing `xlim`. (Reported by William May).

CHANGES IN R 3.3.1

::: subsection
BUG FIXES

-   `R CMD INSTALL` and hence `install.packages()` gave an internal
    error installing a package called *description* from a tarball on a
    case-insensitive file system.

-   `match(x, t)` (and hence `x %in% t`) failed when `x` was of length
    one, and either `character` and `x` and `t` only differed in their
    `Encoding` or when `x` and `t` where `complex` with `NA`s or `NaN`s.
    ([PR#16885](https://bugs.R-project.org/bugzilla3/show_bug.cgi?id=16885).)

-   `unloadNamespace(ns)` also works again when `ns` is a 'namespace',
    as from `getNamespace()`.

-   `rgamma(1, Inf)` or `rgamma(1, 0, 0)` no longer give `NaN` but the
    correct limit.

-   `length(baseenv())` is correct now.

-   `pretty(d, ..)` for date-time `d` rarely failed when `"halfmonth"`
    time steps were tried
    ([PR#16923](https://bugs.R-project.org/bugzilla3/show_bug.cgi?id=16923))
    and on 'inaccurate' platforms such as 32-bit Windows or a
    configuration with `â€“disable-long-double`; see comment #15 of
    [PR#16761](https://bugs.R-project.org/bugzilla3/show_bug.cgi?id=16761).

-   In `text.default(x, y, labels)`, the rarely(?) used default for
    `labels` is now correct also for the case of a 2-column matrix `x`
    and missing `y`.

-   `as.factor(c(a = 1L))` preserves `names()` again as in R \< 3.1.0.

-   `strtrim(""[0], 0[0])` now works.

-   Use of `Ctrl-C` to terminate a reverse incremental search started by
    `Ctrl-R` in the `readline`-based Unix terminal interface is now
    supported when R was compiled against `readline` \>= 6.0 (`Ctrl-G`
    always worked).
    ([PR#16603](https://bugs.R-project.org/bugzilla3/show_bug.cgi?id=16603))

-   `diff(<difftime>)` now keeps the `"units"` attribute, as subtraction
    already did,
    [PR#16940](https://bugs.R-project.org/bugzilla3/show_bug.cgi?id=16940).
:::

::: section
CHANGES IN R 3.3.0

::: subsection
SIGNIFICANT USER-VISIBLE CHANGES

-   `nchar(x, *)`'s argument `keepNA` governing how the result for `NA`s
    in `x` is determined, gets a new default `keepNA = NA` which returns
    `NA` where `x` is `NA`, except for `type = "width"` which still
    returns `2`, the formatting / printing width of `NA`.

-   All builds have support for `https:` URLs in the default methods for
    `download.file()`, `url()` and code making use of them.

    Unfortunately that cannot guarantee that any particular `https:` URL
    can be accessed. For example, server and client have to successfully
    negotiate a cryptographic protocol (TLS/SSL, ...) and the server's
    identity has to be verifiable *via* the available certificates.
    Different access methods may allow different protocols or use
    private certificate bundles: we encountered a `https:` CRAN mirror
    which could be accessed by one browser but not by another nor by
    `download.file()` on the same Linux machine.
:::

::: subsection
NEW FEATURES

-   The `print` method for `methods()` gains a `byclass` argument.

-   New functions `validEnc()` and `validUTF8()` to give access to the
    validity checks for inputs used by `grep()` and friends.

-   Experimental new functionality for S3 method checking, notably
    `isS3method()`.

    Also, the names of the R 'language elements' are exported as
    character vector `tools::langElts`.

-   `str(x)` now displays `"Time-Series"` also for matrix (multivariate)
    time-series, i.e. when `is.ts(x)` is true.

-   (Windows only) The GUI menu item to install local packages now
    accepts `*.tar.gz` files as well as `*.zip` files (but defaults to
    the latter).

-   New programmeR's utility function `chkDots()`.

-   `D()` now signals an error when given invalid input, rather than
    silently returning `NA`. (Request of John Nash.)

-   `formula` objects are slightly more "first class": e.g., `formula()`
    or `new("formula", y ~ x)` are now valid. Similarly, for `"table"`,
    `"ordered"` and `"summary.table"`. Packages defining S4 classes with
    the above S3/S4 classes as slots should be reinstalled.

-   New function `strrep()` for repeating the elements of a character
    vector.

-   `rapply()` preserves attributes on the list when `how = "replace"`.

-   New S3 generic function `sigma()` with methods for extracting the
    estimated standard deviation aka "residual standard deviation" from
    a fitted model.

-   `news()` now displays R and package news files within the HTML help
    system if it is available. If no news file is found, a visible
    `NULL` is returned to the console.

-   `as.raster(x)` now also accepts `raw` arrays `x` assuming values in
    `0:255`.

-   Subscripting of matrix/array objects of type `"expression"` is now
    supported.

-   `type.convert("i")` now returns a factor instead of a complex value
    with zero real part and missing imaginary part.

-   Graphics devices `cairo_pdf()` and `cairo_ps()` now allow
    non-default values of the cairographics 'fallback resolution' to be
    set.

    This now defaults to 300 on all platforms: that is the default
    documented by cairographics, but apparently was not used by all
    system installations.

-   `file()` gains an explicit `method` argument rather than implicitly
    using `getOption("url.method", "default")`.

-   Thanks to a patch from Tomas Kalibera, `x[x != 0]` is now typically
    faster than `x[which(x != 0)]` (in the case where `x` has no NAs,
    the two are equivalent).

-   `read.table()` now always uses the names for a named `colClasses`
    argument (previously names were only used when `colClasses` was too
    short). (In part, wish of
    [PR#16478](https://bugs.R-project.org/bugzilla3/show_bug.cgi?id=16478).)

-   (Windows only) `download.file()` with default `method = "auto"` and
    a `ftps://` URL chooses `"libcurl"` if that is available.

-   The out-of-the box Bioconductor mirror has been changed to one using
    `https://`: use `chooseBioCmirror()` to choose a `http://` mirror if
    required.

-   The data frame and formula methods for `aggregate()` gain a `drop`
    argument.

-   `available.packages()` gains a `repos` argument.

-   The undocumented switching of methods for `url()` on `https:` and
    `ftps:` URLs is confined to `method = "default"` (and documented).

-   `smoothScatter()` gains a `ret.selection` argument.

-   `qr()` no longer has a `...` argument to pass additional arguments
    to methods.

-   `[` has a method for class `"table"`.

-   It is now possible (again) to `replayPlot()` a display list snapshot
    that was created by `recordPlot()` in a different R session.

    It is still not a good idea to use snapshots as a persistent storage
    format for R plots, but it is now not completely silly to use a
    snapshot as a format for transferring an R plot between two R
    sessions.

    The underlying changes mean that packages providing graphics devices
    (e.g., [*Cairo*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=Cairo),
    [*RSvgDevice*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=RSvgDevice),
    [*cairoDevice*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=cairoDevice),
    [*tikzDevice*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=tikzDevice)) will
    need to be reinstalled.

    Code for restoring snapshots was contributed by Jeroen Ooms and JJ
    Allaire.

    Some testing code is available at
    <https://github.com/pmur002/R-display-list>.

-   `tools::undoc(dir = D)` and `codoc(dir = D)` now also work when `D`
    is a directory whose `normalizePath()`ed version does not end in the
    package name, e.g.Â from a symlink.

-   `abbreviate()` has more support for multi-byte character sets -- it
    no longer removes bytes within characters and knows about Latin
    vowels with accents. It is still only really suitable for (most)
    European languages, and still warns on non-ASCII input.

    `abbreviate(use.classes = FALSE)` is now implemented, and that is
    more suitable for non-European languages.

-   `match(x, table)` is faster (sometimes by an order of magnitude)
    when `x` is of length one and `incomparables` is unchanged, thanks
    to Peter Haverty
    ([PR#16491](https://bugs.R-project.org/bugzilla3/show_bug.cgi?id=16491)).

-   More consistent, partly not back-compatible behavior of `NA` and
    `NaN` coercion to complex numbers, operations less often resulting
    in complex `NA` (`NA_complex_`).

-   `lengths()` considers methods for `length` and `[[` on `x`, so it
    should work automatically on any objects for which appropriate
    methods on those generics are defined.

-   The logic for selecting the default screen device on OS X has been
    simplified: it is now `quartz()` if that is available even if
    environment variable `DISPLAY` has been set by the user.

    The choice can easily be overridden *via* environment variable
    `R_INTERACTIVE_DEVICE`.

-   On Unix-like platforms which support the `getline` C library
    function, `system(*,intern = TRUE)` no longer truncates (output)
    lines longer than 8192 characters, thanks to Karl Millar.
    ([PR#16544](https://bugs.R-project.org/bugzilla3/show_bug.cgi?id=16544))

-   `rank()` gains a `ties.method = "last"` option, for convenience (and
    symmetry).

-   `regmatches(invert = NA)` can now be used to extract both
    non-matched and matched substrings.

-   `data.frame()` gains argument `fix.empty.names`;
    `as.data.frame.list()` gets new `cut.names`, `col.names` and
    `fix.empty.names`.

-   `plot(x ~ x, *)` now warns that it is the same as `plot(x ~ 1, *)`.

-   `recordPlot()` has new arguments `load` and `attach` to allow
    package names to be stored as part of a recorded plot.
    `replayPlot()` has new argument `reloadPkgs` to load/attach any
    package names that were stored as part of a recorded plot.

-   S4 dispatch works within calls to `.Internal()`. This means explicit
    S4 generics are no longer needed for `unlist()` and `as.vector()`.

-   Only font family names starting with `"Hershey"` (and not `"Her"` as
    before) are given special treatment by the graphics engine.

-   S4 values are automatically coerced to vector (via `as.vector`) when
    subassigned into atomic vectors.

-   `findInterval()` gets a `left.open` option.

-   The version of LAPACK included in the sources has been updated to
    3.6.0, including those 'deprecated' routines which were previously
    included. *Ca* 40 double-complex routines have been added at the
    request of a package maintainer.

    As before, the details of what is included are in
    `src/modules/lapack/README` and this now gives information on
    earlier additions.

-   `tapply()` has been made considerably more efficient without
    changing functionality, thanks to proposals from Peter Haverty and
    Suharto Anggono.
    ([PR#16640](https://bugs.R-project.org/bugzilla3/show_bug.cgi?id=16640))

-   `match.arg(arg)` (the one-argument case) is faster; so is
    `sort.int()`.
    ([PR#16640](https://bugs.R-project.org/bugzilla3/show_bug.cgi?id=16640))

-   The `format` method for `object_size` objects now also accepts
    "binary" units such as `"KiB"` and e.g., `"Tb"`. (Partly from
    [PR#16649](https://bugs.R-project.org/bugzilla3/show_bug.cgi?id=16649).)

-   Profiling now records calls of the form `foo::bar` and some similar
    cases directly rather than as calls to `<Anonymous>`. Contributed by
    Winston Chang.

-   New string utilities `startsWith(x, prefix)` and
    `endsWith(x, suffix)`. Also provide speedups for some
    `grepl("^...",*)` uses (related to proposals in
    [PR#16490](https://bugs.R-project.org/bugzilla3/show_bug.cgi?id=16490)).

-   Reference class finalizers run at exit, as well as on garbage
    collection.

-   Avoid *parallel* dependency on *stats* for port choice and random
    number seeds.
    ([PR#16668](https://bugs.R-project.org/bugzilla3/show_bug.cgi?id=16668))

-   The radix sort algorithm and implementation from
    [*data.table*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=data.table)
    (`forder`) replaces the previous radix (counting) sort and adds a
    new method for `order()`. Contributed by Matt Dowle and Arun
    Srinivasan, the new algorithm supports logical, integer (even with
    large values), real, and character vectors. It outperforms all other
    methods, but there are some caveats (see `?sort`).

-   The `order()` function gains a `method` argument for choosing
    between `"shell"` and `"radix"`.

-   New function `grouping()` returns a permutation that stably
    rearranges data so that identical values are adjacent. The return
    value includes extra partitioning information on the groups. The
    implementation came included with the new radix sort.

-   `rhyper(nn, m, n, k)` no longer returns `NA` when one of the three
    parameters exceeds the maximal integer.

-   `switch()` now warns when no alternatives are provided.

-   `parallel::detectCores()` now has default `logical = TRUE` on all
    platforms -- as this was the default on Windows, this change only
    affects Sparc Solaris.

    Option `logical = FALSE` is now supported on Linux and recent
    versions of OS X (for the latter, thanks to a suggestion of Kyaw
    Sint).

-   `hist()` for `"Date"` or `"POSIXt"` objects would sometimes give
    misleading labels on the breaks, as they were set to the day before
    the start of the period being displayed. The display format has been
    changed, and the shift of the start day has been made conditional on
    `right = TRUE` (the default).
    ([PR#16679](https://bugs.R-project.org/bugzilla3/show_bug.cgi?id=16679))

-   R now uses a new version of the logo (donated to the R Foundation by
    RStudio). It is defined in `.svg` format, so will resize without
    unnecessary degradation when displayed on HTML pages---there is also
    a vector PDF version. Thanks to Dirk Eddelbuettel for producing the
    corresponding X11 icon.

-   New function `.traceback()` returns the stack trace which
    `traceback()` prints.

-   `lengths()` dispatches internally.

-   `dotchart()` gains a `pt.cex` argument to control the size of points
    separately from the size of plot labels. Thanks to Michael Friendly
    and Milan Bouchet-Valat for ideas and patches.

-   `as.roman(ch)` now correctly deals with more diverse character
    vectors `ch`; also arithmetic with the resulting roman numbers works
    in more cases.
    ([PR#16779](https://bugs.R-project.org/bugzilla3/show_bug.cgi?id=16779))

-   `prcomp()` gains a new option `rank.` allowing to directly aim for
    less than `min(n,p)` PC's. The `summary()` and its `print()` method
    have been amended, notably for this case.

-   `gzcon()` gains a new option `text`, which marks the connection as
    text-oriented (so e.g.Â `pushBack()` works). It is still always
    opened in binary mode.

-   The `import()` namespace directive now accepts an argument `except`
    which names symbols to exclude from the imports. The `except`
    expression should evaluate to a character vector (after substituting
    symbols for strings). See Writing R Extensions.

-   New convenience function `Rcmd()` in package *tools* for invoking
    `R CMD` tools from within R.

-   New functions `makevars_user()` and `makevars_site()` in package
    *tools* to determine the location of the user and site specific
    `Makevars` files for customizing package compilation.
:::

::: subsection
UTILITIES

-   `R CMD check` has a new option `â€“ignore-vignettes` for use with
    non-Sweave vignettes whose `VignetteBuilder` package is not
    available.

-   `R CMD check` now by default checks code usage (*via*
    [*codetools*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=codetools)) with
    only the base package attached. Functions from default packages
    other than *base* which are used in the package code but not
    imported are reported as undefined globals, with a suggested
    addition to the `NAMESPACE` file.

-   `R CMD check â€“as-cran` now also checks DOIs in package `CITATION`
    and Rd files.

-   `R CMD Rdconv` and `R CMD Rd2pdf` each have a new option
    `â€“RdMacros=pkglist` which allows Rd macros to be specified before
    processing.
:::

::: subsection
DEPRECATED AND DEFUNCT

-   The previously included versions of `zlib`, `bzip2`, `xz` and PCRE
    have been removed, so suitable external (usually system) versions
    are required (see the 'R Installation and Administration' manual).

-   The unexported and undocumented Windows-only devices `cairo_bmp()`,
    `cairo_png()` and `cairo_tiff()` have been removed. (These devices
    should be used as e.g.Â `bmp(type = "cairo")`.)

-   (Windows only) Function `setInternet2()` has no effect and will be
    removed in due course. The choice between methods `"internal"` and
    `"wininet"` is now made by the `method` arguments of `url()` and
    `download.file()` and their defaults can be set *via* options. The
    out-of-the-box default remains `"wininet"` (as it has been since R
    3.2.2).

-   `[<-` with an S4 value into a list currently embeds the S4 object
    into its own list such that the end result is roughly equivalent to
    using `[[<-`. That behavior is deprecated. In the future, the S4
    value will be coerced to a list with `as.list()`.

-   Package *tools*' functions `package.dependencies()`, `pkgDepends()`,
    etc are deprecated now, mostly in favor of `package_dependencies()`
    which is both more flexible and efficient.
:::

::: subsection
INSTALLATION and INCLUDED SOFTWARE

-   Support for very old versions of `valgrind` (e.g., 3.3.0) has been
    removed.

-   The included `libtool` script (generated by `configure`) has been
    updated to version 2.4.6 (from 2.2.6a).

-   `libcurl` version 7.28.0 or later with support for the `https`
    protocol is required for installation (except on Windows).

-   BSD networking is now required (except on Windows) and so
    `capabilities("http/ftp")` is always true.

-   `configure` uses `pkg-config` for PNG, TIFF and JPEG where this is
    available. This should work better with multiple installs and with
    those using static libraries.

-   The minimum supported version of OS X is 10.6 ('Snow Leopard'): even
    that has been unsupported by Apple since 2012.

-   The `configure` default on OS X is `â€“disable-R-framework`: enable
    this if you intend to install under `/Library/Frameworks` and use
    with `R.app`.

-   The minimum preferred version of PCRE has since R 3.0.0 been 8.32
    (released in Nov 2012). Versions 8.10 to 8.31 are now deprecated
    (with warnings from `configure`), but will still be accepted until R
    3.4.0.

-   `configure` looks for C functions `__cospi`, `__sinpi` and `__tanpi`
    and uses these if `cospi` *etc* are not found. (OS X is the main
    instance.)

-   (Windows) R is now built using `gcc` 4.9.3. This build will require
    recompilation of at least those packages that include C++ code, and
    possibly others. A build of R-devel using the older toolchain will
    be temporarily available for comparison purposes.

    During the transition, the environment variable `R_COMPILED_BY` has
    been defined to indicate which toolchain was used to compile R (and
    hence, which should be used to compile code in packages). The
    `COMPILED_BY` variable described below will be a permanent
    replacement for this.

-   (Windows) A `make` and `R CMD config` variable named `COMPILED_BY`
    has been added. This indicates which toolchain was used to compile R
    (and hence, which should be used to compile code in packages).
:::

::: subsection
PACKAGE INSTALLATION

-   The `make` macro `AWK` which used to be made available to files such
    as `src/Makefile` is no longer set.
:::

::: subsection
C-LEVEL FACILITIES

-   The API call `logspace_sum` introduced in R 3.2.0 is now remapped as
    an entry point to `Rf_logspace_sum`, and its first argument has
    gained a `const` qualifier.
    ([PR#16470](https://bugs.R-project.org/bugzilla3/show_bug.cgi?id=16470))

    Code using it will need to be reinstalled.

    Similarly, entry point `log1pexp` also defined in `Rmath.h` is
    remapped there to `Rf_log1pexp`

-   `R_GE_version` has been increased to `11`.

-   New API call `R_orderVector1`, a faster one-argument version of
    `R_orderVector`.

-   When R headers such as `R.h` and `Rmath.h` are called from C++ code
    in packages they include the C++ versions of system headers such as
    `<cmath>` rather than the legacy headers such as `<math.h>`.
    (Headers `Rinternals.h` and `Rinterface.h` already did, and
    inclusion of system headers can still be circumvented by defining
    `NO_C_HEADERS`, including as from this version for those two
    headers.)

    The manual has long said that R headers should **not** be included
    within an `extern "C"` block, and almost all the packages affected
    by this change were doing so.

-   Including header `S.h` from C++ code would fail on some platforms,
    and so gives a compilation error on all.

-   The deprecated header `Rdefines.h` is now compatible with defining
    `R_NO_REMAP`.

-   The connections API now includes a function `R_GetConnection()`
    which allows packages implementing connections to convert R
    `connection` objects to `Rconnection` handles used in the API. Code
    which previously used the low-level R-internal `getConnection()`
    entry point should switch to the official API.

BUG FIXES

-   C-level `asChar(x)` is fixed for when `x` is not a vector, and it
    returns `"TRUE"`/`"FALSE"` instead of `"T"`/`"F"` for logical
    vectors.

-   The first arguments of `.colSums()` etc (with an initial dot) are
    now named `x` rather than `X` (matching `colSums()`): thus error
    messages are corrected.

-   A `coef()` method for class `"maov"` has been added to allow
    `vcov()` to work with multivariate results.
    ([PR#16380](https://bugs.R-project.org/bugzilla3/show_bug.cgi?id=16380))

-   `method = "libcurl"` connections signal errors rather than
    retrieving HTTP error pages (where the ISP reports the error).

-   `xpdrows.data.frame()` was not checking for unique row names; in
    particular, this affected assignment to non-existing rows via
    numerical indexing.
    ([PR#16570](https://bugs.R-project.org/bugzilla3/show_bug.cgi?id=16570))

-   `tail.matrix()` did not work for zero rows matrices, and could
    produce row "labels" such as `"[1e+05,]"`.

-   Data frames with a column named `"stringsAsFactors"` now format and
    print correctly.
    ([PR#16580](https://bugs.R-project.org/bugzilla3/show_bug.cgi?id=16580))

-   `cor()` is now guaranteed to return a value with absolute value less
    than or equal to 1.
    ([PR#16638](https://bugs.R-project.org/bugzilla3/show_bug.cgi?id=16638))

-   Array subsetting now keeps `names(dim(.))`.

-   Blocking socket connection selection recovers more gracefully on
    signal interrupts.

-   The `data.frame` method of `rbind()` construction `row.names` works
    better in borderline integer cases, but may change the names
    assigned.
    ([PR#16666](https://bugs.R-project.org/bugzilla3/show_bug.cgi?id=16666))

-   (X11 only) `getGraphicsEvent()` miscoded buttons and missed mouse
    motion events.
    ([PR#16700](https://bugs.R-project.org/bugzilla3/show_bug.cgi?id=16700))

-   `methods(round)` now also lists `round.POSIXt`.

-   `tar()` now works with the default `files = NULL`.
    ([PR#16716](https://bugs.R-project.org/bugzilla3/show_bug.cgi?id=16716))

-   Jumps to outer contexts, for example in error recovery, now make
    intermediate jumps to contexts where `on.exit()` actions are
    established instead of trying to run all `on.exit()` actions before
    jumping to the final target. This unwinds the stack gradually,
    releases resources held on the stack, and significantly reduces the
    chance of a segfault when running out of C stack space. Error
    handlers established using `withCallingHandlers()` and
    `options("error")` specifications are ignored when handling a C
    stack overflow error as attempting one of these would trigger a
    cascade of C stack overflow errors. (These changes resolve
    [PR#16753](https://bugs.R-project.org/bugzilla3/show_bug.cgi?id=16753).)

-   The spacing could be wrong when printing a complex array. (Report
    and patch by Lukas Stadler.)

-   `pretty(d, n, min.n, *)` for date-time objects `d` works again in
    border cases with large `min.n`, returns a `labels` attribute also
    for small-range dates and in such cases its returned length is
    closer to the desired `n`.
    ([PR#16761](https://bugs.R-project.org/bugzilla3/show_bug.cgi?id=16761))
    Additionally, it finally does cover the range of `d`, as it always
    claimed.

-   `tsp(x) <- NULL` did not handle correctly objects inheriting from
    both `"ts"` and `"mts"`.
    ([PR#16769](https://bugs.R-project.org/bugzilla3/show_bug.cgi?id=16769))

-   `install.packages()` could give false errors when
    `options("pkgType")` was `"binary"`. (Reported by Jose Claudio
    Faria.)

-   A bug fix in R 3.0.2 fixed problems with `locator()` in X11, but
    introduced problems in Windows. Now both should be fixed.
    ([PR#15700](https://bugs.R-project.org/bugzilla3/show_bug.cgi?id=15700))

-   `download.file()` with `method = "wininet"` incorrectly warned of
    download file length difference when reported length was unknown.
    ([PR#16805](https://bugs.R-project.org/bugzilla3/show_bug.cgi?id=16805))

-   `diag(NULL, 1)` crashed because of missed type checking.
    ([PR#16853](https://bugs.R-project.org/bugzilla3/show_bug.cgi?id=16853))
