::: article
The ninth R user conference will take place at the University of
Castilla-La Mancha, Albacete, Spain from Wednesday 10 July 2013 to
Friday 12 July 2013. Following previous *useR!* conferences, this
meeting of the R user community will

-   focus on R as the 'lingua franca' of data analysis and statistical
    computing;

-   provide a platform for R users to discuss and exchange ideas on how
    R can be used for statistical computation, data analysis,
    visualization and exciting applications in various fields;

-   give an overview of the new features of the ever evolving R project.

As with the predecessor conferences, the program consists of two parts:

-   invited talks discussing new R developments and exciting
    applications of R

-   user-contributed presentation reflecting the wide range of fields in
    which R is used to analyze data.

A major goal of the useR! conference is to bring users from various
fields together and provide a platform for discussion and exchange of
ideas: both in the formal framework of presentations as well as in the
informal times surrounding the conference sessions.

# Invited speakers

The invited talks represent the spectrum of interest from important
technical developments to exciting applications of R, presented by
experts in the field:

-   *María Jesús Bayarri*: New challenges and Bayes: The world of
    computer models.

-   *José Manuel Benítez-Sánchez*: Computational Intelligence in R.

-   *Duncan Murdoch*: What's new in R3.0.X.

-   *Havard Rue*: Bayesian computing with INLA and the R-INLA package.

-   *Steve Scott*: Bayesian computation in C++ with R as an interface.

-   *Hadley Wickham*: BigR data

# User-contributed sessions

In the contributed sessions, presenters will share innovative and
interesting uses of R, covering topics such as:

-   Bayesian statistics

-   Bioinformatics

-   Chemometrics and computational physics

-   Data mining

-   Econometrics & finance

-   Environmetrics & ecological modeling

-   High performance computing

-   Imaging

-   Interfaces with other languages/software

-   Machine learning

-   Multivariate statistics

-   Nonparametric statistics

-   Pharmaceutical statistics

-   Psychometrics

-   Spatial statistics

-   Statistics in the social and political sciences

-   Teaching

-   Visualization & graphics

The poster session will be a major social event on the evening of the
first day of the conference. Contributed talks will be organised in the
following types of session:

-   *useR! Kaleidoscope*: These sessions give a broad overview of the
    many different applications of R and should appeal to a wide
    audience.

-   *useR! Focus Session*: These sessions cover topics of special
    interest and may be more technical.

In both cases presentations will be allowed 17 minutes, followed by 3
minutes discussion. In addition to the regular contributed talks, all
participants are invited to present a *Lightning Talk*, for which no
abstract is required. These talks provide a 5-minute platform to speak
on any R-related topic and should particularly appeal to R newbies.
Participants wishing to give such a talk must provide an informative
title.

tutorials will be offered on Tuesday, July 9th:
