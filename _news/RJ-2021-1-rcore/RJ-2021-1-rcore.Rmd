# R 4.1.0 selected changes

R 4.1.0 (codename "Camp Pontanezen") was released on 2021-05-18. The
following gives a selection of the most important changes.

-   R now provides a simple native forward pipe syntax \|\>. The simple
    form of the forward pipe inserts the left-hand side as the first
    argument in the right-hand side call. The pipe implementation as a
    syntax transformation was motivated by suggestions from Jim Hester
    and Lionel Henry. The current implementation does not provide a
    shorthand for passing the left-hand side as an argument other than
    the first. Several options for providing such a shorthand are
    currently under consideration.

-   R now provides a shorthand notation for creating functions, e.g.
    `\(x) x + 1` is parsed as `function(x) x + 1`.

-   The base environment and its namespace are now locked (so one can no
    longer add bindings to these or remove from these)

-   Support for gradient fills, pattern fills, clipping paths and masks
    has been added to the R graphics engine. An R-level interface for
    these new features has been added to the grid graphics package. See
    [Paul Murrell's blog
    post](https://developer.r-project.org/Blog/public/2020/07/15/new-features-in-the-r-graphics-engine)
    for more details.

-   Graphics devices can now specify deviceClip. If TRUE, the graphics
    engine will never perform any clipping of output itself. The
    clipping that the graphics engine does perform (for both canClip =
    TRUE and canClip = FALSE) has been improved to avoid producing
    unnecessary artifacts in clipped output. See [Paul Murrell's blog
    post](https://developer.r-project.org/Blog/public/2020/06/08/improvements-to-clipping-in-the-r-graphics-engine)
    for more details.

-   New palettes \"Rocket\" and \"Mako\" for hcl.colors() (approximating
    palettes of the same name from the 'viridisLite' package).
    Contributed by Achim Zeileis.

-   Rterm, the command-line R front-end on Windows, now supports line
    editing and cursor motion with multi-byte and multi-width printable
    characters. It is now possible to use RTerm with non-European
    characters when the current locale (e.g. double-byte) supports them.
    Previously, users of non-European languages had to resort to other
    front ends, e.g. RGui. On (still experimental) UCRT builds of R on
    recent Windows 10, the native encoding is UTF-8 and hence all
    characters supported by Windows and the font can be used in Rterm,
    including characters outside of Basic Multilingual Plane (surrogate
    pairs in UTF-16LE). This required a significant rewrite of code
    originating from getline library. See [Tomas Kalibera's blog
    post](https://developer.r-project.org/Blog/public/2021/04/17/improved-multi-byte-support-in-rterm/)
    for more details.

-   Data set esoph in package datasets now provides the correct numbers
    of controls; previously it had the numbers of cases added to these.
    Reported by Alexander Fowler in
    [PR#17964](https://bugs.R-project.org/bugzilla3/show_bug.cgi?id=17964).

-   Using c() to combine a factor with other factors now gives a factor
    (an ordered factor when combining ordered factors with identical
    levels).

-   New function charClass() has been added to package utils to query
    the wide-character classification functions in use by R (such as
    iswprint, iswalpha, islower). On Windows and by default on macOS and
    AIX, the classes are determined by R's internal tables. On Linux,
    the C99 functions and the classification provided by the platform
    are used. charClass() accepts UTF-8 encoded R strings and integer
    vectors of Unicode points on input.

-   R's internal Unicode tables for character classification and
    character width were updated to Unicode 13.0.0 (used on Windows and
    by default on macOS and AIX). Handling of \\U escapes in the parser
    was improved. String truncation is now more careful: most instances
    in R have been fixed not to produce incomplete multi-byte
    characters. Additionally, there were several encoding-related bug
    fixes.

-   R and CRAN package binaries are now available also for the new Apple
    silicon Macs (M1 and higher) as native 64-bit ARM builds. Fortran
    code is compiled by a development version of GNU Fortran compiler
    from Iain Sandoe as no free Fortran 90 compiler for the platform has
    been released, yet. Only minimal changes to base R were needed for
    this: now R turns off floating-point ARM RunFast mode, hence
    disabling flush-to-zero and default-NaN modes. The default-NaN mode
    is not desirable for R because it causes R NA values to become NaN
    even in operations involving otherwise only finite values ( NA \* 1
    would be NaN). For more details on the NaN/NA issue, see an
    otherwise already outdated [blog
    post](https://developer.r-project.org/Blog/public/2020/11/02/will-r-work-on-apple-silicon/)
    of Tomas Kalibera and Simon Urbanek. For more information on M1
    support in R, see [R Installation and
    Administration](https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/r-release/R-admin.html).

-   An experimental build of R and binaries of CRAN packages and their
    Bioconductor dependencies is now available for Windows. The builds
    use UCRT as the C runtime (previous builds used MSVCRT) to allow
    setting UTF-8 as the native encoding on recent Windows 10, hence
    substantially reducing the amount of encoding issues in R on that
    platform. All required external libraries had to be rebuilt, because
    all code linked statically on Windows needs to use the same C
    runtime. This used a new GCC 10 MinGW-w64 cross- and native
    toolchains compiled using MXE. These builds use R-devel and did so
    also at the time of 4.1.0 release, but were still experimental at
    that time and only selected patches have been ported to 4.1.0
    (accepting UTF-8 as native encoding, the rewrite of RTerm/getline,
    Windows installer improvements). More details are available in Tomas
    Kalibera's blog posts from [March
    2021](https://developer.r-project.org/Blog/public/2021/03/12/windows/utf-8-toolchain-and-cran-package-checks),
    [July
    2020](https://developer.r-project.org/Blog/public/2020/07/30/windows/utf-8-build-of-r-and-cran-packages),

    2020](https://developer.r-project.org/Blog/public/2020/05/02/utf-8-support-on-windows).

# R 4.1.0 code statistics

From the source code Subversion repository, the overall change between
April 25, 2020 and May 28, 2021 (so between R 4.0.0 and R 4.1.0) was:
33,000 added lines, 14,000 deleted lines and 1000 changed files. This is
rounded to thousands/hundreds and excludes changes to common generated
files, bulk re-organizations, etc. (translations, parsers, autoconf,
LAPACK, R Journal bibliography, test outputs, Unicode tables,
incorporated M4 macros). This change is slightly bigger than that
between R 3.6.0 and R 4.0.0 (24% more insertions, 10% more deletions, 4%
more changed files), see News and Notes from the December 2020 issue of
the R Journal.

Figure [\[fig:svn41\]](#fig:svn41){reference-type="ref"
reference="fig:svn41"} shows commits by month and weekday, respectively,
counting line-based changes in individual commits, excluding the files
as above. The statistics are computed the same way as in the previous
issue, hence allowing direct comparisons, but monthly statistics are
impacted by the release date which varies across versions, hence
impacting the numbers for April and May. The statistics cover code
directly committed to the R-devel trunk, plus commits from the R-defs
branch (graphics code from Paul Murrell). The latter was merged into
R-devel in July 2020, but the statistics is based on months/days the
original commits were made to R-defs, including from December 2019.

We observe an activity peak just after the release of R 4.0.0, a minimum
in October 2020, and otherwise relatively stable amounts of code
changes. The large numbers in May/June do not seem to follow a general
pattern: here Paul Murrell did most of his changes on graphics. The
right-hand plot shows that there is still a number of contributions even
during the weekends.

# R 4.1.0 bugs statistics

Summaries of bug-related activities during the development of R 4.1.0
(from April 25, 2020 to May 18, 2021) were derived from the database
underlying [R's Bugzilla system](https://bugs.R-project.org/bugzilla/).
Figure [\[fig:bz41\]](#fig:bz41){reference-type="ref"
reference="fig:bz41"} shows statistics of reported/closed bugs and
number of added comments (on any bug report) by calendar month and
weekday, respectively. Deviating from the previous issue, new bug
reports (comment 0) are not counted as comments, so these numbers cannot
be compared directly. Note that monthly statistics are impacted by
truncation at the release dates in April 2020 and May 2021,
respectively.

Comments are added by reporters of the bugs, R Core members and external
volunteers. When a bug report is closed, the bug is either fixed or the
report is found invalid. In principle, this can happen multiple times
for a single report, but those cases are rare. Hence the number of
comments is a measure of effort (yet a coarse one which does not
distinguish thorough analyses from one-liners) and the number of bug
closures is a measure of success in dealing with bugs.

R 4.1.0 was released by about 3 weeks later than usual, so the period
which is summarized is also longer. The bug-related activities have
still increased much more than what could be explained by that: about
17% more bugs closed than for (during development of) 4.0.0, but 55%
more bugs reported). The increase from 3.6.0 to 4.0.0 was 45% more bug
reports and 92% more bugs closed.

There was a significant increase in the number of comments following a
[blog
post](https://developer.r-project.org/Blog/public/2019/10/09/r-can-use-your-help-reviewing-bug-reports)
of Tomas Kalibera and Luke Tierney, published October 9, 2019 (so during
development of 4.0.0), asking the R community for help with the bugs.
The rate of comments stayed relatively high until now, so for the
development of 4.1.0. This increased activity also came with more bug
reports and more bugs closed. Initially, more bugs were closed than
reported (4.0.0 development), but this changed during 4.1.0. It may be
that the bugs fixed initially with the help of external volunteers were
the older ones easy to handle, but now there is space for external
volunteers to help with the new/harder ones.

From the numbers by weekday in the right panel of
Figure [\[fig:bz41\]](#fig:bz41){reference-type="ref"
reference="fig:bz41"} we see that the R community still keeps working
during the weekends. Still, the overall bigger bug-related activity
seems relatively more reduced during the weekends than during 4.0.0 and
3.6.0 development.
