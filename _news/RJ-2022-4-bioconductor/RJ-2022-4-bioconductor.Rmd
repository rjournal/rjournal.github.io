[Bioconductor](https://bioconductor.org) provides tools for the analysis
and comprehension of high-throughput genomic data. The project has
entered its twentieth year, with funding for core development and
infrastructure maintenance secured through 2025 (NIH NHGRI
2U24HG004059). Additional support is provided by NIH NCI,
Chan-Zuckerberg Initiative, National Science Foundation, Microsoft, and
Amazon. In this news report, we give some details about the software and
data resource collection, infrastructure for building, checking, and
distributing resources, core team activities, and some new initiatives.

*Software ecosystem*

Bioconductor 3.15 was released on 27 April, 2022. It is compatible with
R 4.2.0 and consists of 2140 software packages, 410 experiment data
packages, 990 up-to-date annotation packages, 29 workflows, and 3 books.
[Books](https://bioconductor.org/books/release/) are built regularly
from source and therefore fully reproducible; an example is the
community-developed [Orchestrating Single-Cell Analysis with
Bioconductor](https://bioconductor.org/books/release/OSCA/). The
Bioconductor [3.15 release
announcement](https://bioconductor.org/news/bioc_3_15_release/) includes
descriptions of 78 new software packages, and updates to NEWS files for
many additional packages.

*Infrastructure updates*

-   Thanks to a generous allocation (BIR190004, \"Engineering and
    disseminating a software and analysis ecosystem for genomic data
    science\") provided through the National Science Foundation ACCESS
    (formerly XSEDE) program, academic cloud resources including GPUs
    and highly accessible object storage systems are being integrated
    into project operations.

-   Transition of primary funding administration from Roswell Park
    Comprehensive Cancer Center to Dana-Farber Cancer Institute has led
    to a number of changes to platforms in use for the checking and
    production of binary package images.

    -   Linux builds occur at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute.

    -   Windows builds occur in machinery provided by Microsoft Genomics
        in the Azure cloud environment.

    -   MacOS builds occur at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute. Work on the
        support of ARM Mac systems occurs at MacStadium.

    -   Details on the configurations of builders (e.g., [the Linux
        builder](https://bioconductor.org/checkResults/3.16/bioc-LATEST/nebbiolo2-NodeInfo.html)
        for the devel branch) are available at the [Build
        reports](https://bioconductor.org/checkResults/) link at
        bioconductor.org.

-   An interactive app for surveying adverse conditions arising for
    package install, build, and check processes has been introduced for
    [release](https://vjcitn.shinyapps.io/biocPkgState315/) and
    [devel](https://vjcitn.shinyapps.io/biocPkgState316/) branches.

-   Cloud-based workshop delivery systems have been an integral part of
    Bioconductor conferences and teaching activities.

    -   Workshops from Bioconductor 2022 are continuously available for
        inspection and hands-on exercises at
        <http://app.orchestra.cancerdatasci.org>, thanks to cloud
        computing support provided by Dr. Sean Davis of University of
        Colorado.

    -   <http://workshop.bioconductor.org> is a Galaxy-based workshop
        collection deployed on Jetstream2 in NSF ACCESS.

*Core team updates*

-   After six years of highly effective work in the core, Nitesh Turaga
    has left for a position in industry. We will miss him!

-   New core developers Jen Wokaty and Alexandru Mahmoud have joined.
    Jen is a member of the Waldron Lab at CUNY. Alex works at Channing
    Division of Network Medicine.

-   Jen and Alex are joined by long-term core members Lori Kern of
    Roswell Park Comprehensive Cancer Center, Marcel Ramos of CUNY and
    Roswell, and Hervé Pages of Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center.

*New initiatives*

-   Thanks to efforts of members of the Technical and Community Advisory
    Boards and community members, a collection of working groups has
    been defined to achieve new project aims. An
    [overview](http://workinggroups.bioconductor.org/currently-active-working-groups-committees.html)
    of currently active working groups is available, along with
    [guidelines for proposing new working
    groups](http://workinggroups.bioconductor.org/working-group-and-committee-guidelines.html).

-   The objectives of the bioconductor-teaching working group are stated
    at the associated
    [repository](https://github.com/bioconductor/bioconductor-teaching):

    > The Bioconductor teaching committee is a collaborative effort to
    > consolidate Bioconductor-focused training material and establish a
    > community of Bioconductor trainers. We define a curriculum and
    > implement online lessons for beginner and more advanced R users
    > who want to learn to analyse their data with Bioconductor
    > packages.

-   A [mentoring
    program](https://bioconductor.org/developers/new-developer-program/)
    for new developers has taken flight.

-   Thanks to an Essential Open Source Software grant from the
    Chan-Zuckerberg Initiative, we have partnered with the Dana-Farber
    Cancer Institute [YES for
    CURE](https://www.dfhcc.harvard.edu/research/cancer-disparities/students/yes-for-cure/)
    (Young Empowered Scientists for Continued Research Engagement)
    program to offer instruction in cancer data science to interested
    undergraduates. A [pkgdown site](https://vjcitn.github.io/YESCDS/)
    includes current curricular materials.

-   With the NSF-based academic cloud resources previously mentioned, we
    have begun gestation of G-DADS, a program for Genomic Data and
    Analysis Development Services, with the objectives of providing
    publicly accessible storage and compute on exemplars of the latest
    high-volume experimental modalities, and of promoting GPUs to
    first-class citizenship in our build and check systems.

*Using Bioconductor*

Start using Bioconductor by installing the most recent version of R and
evaluating the commands

::: example
if (!requireNamespace(\"BiocManager\", quietly = TRUE))
install.packages(\"BiocManager\") BiocManager::install()
:::

Install additional packages and dependencies, e.g.,
[SingleCellExperiment](https://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/SingleCellExperiment.html),
with

::: example
BiocManager::install(\"SingleCellExperiment\")
:::

[Docker](https://bioconductor.org/help/docker/) images provides a very
effective on-ramp for power users to rapidly obtain access to
standardized and scalable computing environments. Key resources include:

-   [bioconductor.org](https://bioconductor.org) to install, learn, use,
    and develop Bioconductor packages.

-   A list of [available software](https://bioconductor.org/packages),
    linking to pages describing each package.

-   A question-and-answer style [user support
    site](https://support.bioconductor.org) and developer-oriented
    [mailing list](https://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/bioc-devel).

-   A community slack ([sign up](https://bioc-community.herokuapp.com/))
    for extended technical discussion.

-   The [F1000Research Bioconductor
    channel](https://f1000research.com/channels/bioconductor) for
    peer-reviewed Bioconductor work flows.

-   The [Bioconductor
    YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/user/bioconductor) channel includes
    recordings of keynote and talks from recent conferences including
    Bioc2022, EuroBioC2022, and BiocAsia2021, in addition to video
    recordings of training courses.

-   Our [package
    submission](https://github.com/Bioconductor/Contributions)
    repository for open technical review of new packages.

Recent Bioconductor conferences include [BioC
2022](https://bioc2022.bioconductor.org) (July 27-29), and [European
Bioconductor Meeting](https://eurobioc2022.bioconductor.org/) (September
14-16). Each had invited and contributed talks, as well as workshops and
other sessions to enable community participation. Slides, videos, and
workshop material for each conference are, or will soon be, available on
each conference web site as well as from the [Courses and
Conferences](http://bioconductor.org/help/course-materials/) section of
the Bioconductor web site.

The Bioconductor project continues to mature as a community. The
[Technical](https://bioconductor.org/about/technical-advisory-board/)
and
[Community](https://bioconductor.org/about/community-advisory-board/)
Advisory Boards provide guidance to ensure that the project addresses
leading-edge biological problems with advanced technical approaches, and
adopts practices (such as a project-wide [Code of
Conduct](https://bioconductor.org/about/code-of-conduct/)) that
encourages all to participate. We look forward to welcoming you!
