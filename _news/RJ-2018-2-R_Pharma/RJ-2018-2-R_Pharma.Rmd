::: article
The R / Pharma conference began as grass-roots initiative led by data
scientists working in the pharmaceutical industry to promote the use of
R in Pharma, and to establish and share best practices. The founding
members organized the project as an R Consortium working group, and
undertook the ambitious task of launching an annual conference
envisioned as a relatively small, collegial, industry-oriented event
with a strong scientific program.

## Inaugural Conference

The inaugural conference, R / Pharma 2018 (<https://bit.ly/2RVKKI8>)
held on August 16th and 17th at Harvard University attracted a
representatives from academia, government, and industry.

Keynotes (<https://bit.ly/2SdvMNd>) were presented by Lilliam Rosario of
the FDA's Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, Michael Lawrence
Genentech/Roche and the R Core Group, and Max Kuhn and Joe Cheng from
RStudio.

Over forty-five talks and workshops were delivered with topics ranging
from reproducible research, regulatory constraints and considerations,
and package administration to scaling R for production. A considerable
number of talks emphasized the development of production-grade Shiny
applications. Although considerably larger than most of the Shiny
applications developed, Roche's 500,000 line application, which was
presented at the conference and subsequently written up in a post
(<https://bit.ly/2NeXKFJ>), reflects a common use case. Abstracts for
the talks are available (<https://bit.ly/2CUTEeG>).
