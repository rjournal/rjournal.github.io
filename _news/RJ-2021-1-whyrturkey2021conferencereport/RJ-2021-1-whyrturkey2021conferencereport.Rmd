# Why R? Turkey 2021

The [Why R? Turkey 2021](whyr.pl/2021/turkey/) is a pre-meeting of Why
R? 2021 conference. Why R? conferences are international conference
series organized annually by the [Why R? Foundation](whyr.pl) since
2017. It is one of the largest annual R conferences in Central Europe
[@why2019]. In addition to the main conference, pre-meetings are held in
different cities from all over the world. In 2017, four pre-meetings
were organized in Poland. Thereafter, eleven pre-meetings across four
different countries were held in 2018. In 2019, twelve pre-meetings took
place in eight different countries. In 2020, in a pre-meeting framework,
totally six organizations appeared in four different countries (Poland
(2), Turkey (2), Ireland (1), and Germany (1)). Among those six
pre-meetings, two of them were held in Istanbul (24.04.2020) and Ankara
(27.04.2020) consecutively, as a one-day organization [@whyrEvents].\

Two primary goals of Why R ? Turkey 2021 are;

1.  to bring together Turkish R users from all over the world

2.  to broaden the horizon of the students with respect to the diverse
    disciplines

For this purpose, experienced researchers, who are R users, from various
disciplines were invited to the conference as a speaker. The conference
program was designed comprehensively to cover various research fields
such as bio-statistics, sociology, educational sciences, psychology,
molecular biology, genomics, football analytics, and economics. The
detailed program is shown in Table [1](#tab:prog).

# Participants

There were 2180 registered participants, 60% were students and 40% were
professionals who work for governmental institutions, companies from the
private sector, and academicians from the universities in Turkey. With
regards to the education level of the student participants, 50% of them
was graduate and rest was undergraduate students. 60% of the students
study Statistics. The number of unique participants for the conference
is 880. Additionally, the share of each thematic session is counted as
540, 435, 380, 355, 390, 360, respectively. The whole event was
organized and moderated by the organization committee including 6
members.

Most of the participants were registered from İstanbul, Ankara, and
İzmir, respectively. In the conference, we had participants from 73
provinces out of 81 provinces in Turkey. The distribution of registered
participants by provinces is illustrated in Figure [2](#fig2).

# Promotion of the Event and Reactions

The social media channels (Instagram, Twitter, Facebook and, LinkedIn)
were used for the promotion of the conference. Conference social media
accounts were created to conduct the promotion except LinkedIn.
Organization committee members' personal LinkedIn accounts were
preferred to promote the event.

Instagram ads were used to reach out bigger audience. Advertisements
went live two weeks before starting date of the conference and finished
4 days before the conference started. At the end of this period, we
obtained more than 500 followers most of whom are young adults as shown
in Figure [3](#fig3). Besides, the Instagram account of the conference
was visited more than 2.000 times during the advertisement period.

![Figure 3: Age Distribution of Instagram
Followers](insta_followers.png){#fig3 width="100%"

In addition to Instagram, Twitter was also used efficiently for the
promotion. The Twitter account for this event was created in January,
but the posts started to be shared at the end of February. To reach R
users, all contents were posted using the `#Rstats` hashtag. As of May
8, the Twitter account of the conference was visited by more than 18000
users, and tweets were viewed more than 174000 times.

According to our calendar, we started to share our posts once a week on
Twitter. Although post frequency was lower at the beginning, the number
of followers reached over three hundreds quickly. However, the account
gained the highest number of followers in April. (Figure [4](#fig4)).

![Figure 4: Evolution of the number of followers of the WhyR? Turkey
2021 Twitter Account](whyr_twiter.png){#fig4 width="100%"
alt="graphic without alt text"}

Thus, visits and view statistics of the Twitter account show that
Twitter was the most efficient platform to reach R users.

# Technical Solutions

The official website was developed and used as the primary information
source for the conference. The website was hosted on [Why R?
Foundation's domain](whyr.pl). This allowed us to be more visible on
Google Search. The abstract book was prepared using the bookdown R
package and was served via the website.

Instant updates in terms of program, speakers, program, schedule, were
shared with the audience via Instagram, and Twitter accounts, dedicated
to the conference. Twitter and Instagram account caught the attention of
people interested in participating in the conference very quickly.

Google Forms was preferred for registration purposes and used as a
contact form. Hyperlinks to the registration form and contact form were
added to the website. During registration, participants were asked to
answer questions regarding their professional background, education
level, R knowledge. Thanks to this, we had a chance to better understand
participants' profiles.

All speeches were streamed on Zoom. Premium zoom account was purchased
to be able to have 1000 participants online at the same time. Separate
zoom meetings were set for each session. After each talk, dedicated
breakout rooms were created and Q&A sessions were conducted in breakout
rooms. This allowed the audience to have more interaction with speakers.
The cost of the Zoom account was covered by the funding received from
Why R? Foundation and R Consortium. URLs for the recordings, as well as
slide decks and R scripts used by speakers during presentations, shared
publicly on the [GitHub
repository](https://github.com/whyr2021turkey/Konusmalar) of the
conference.

# Summary

The three-day online conference of Why R? Turkey 2021 aimed to bring R
users from different fields and make a connection between the Turkish R
users and possible future users from various disciplines. In that
respect, the attained total number of participants, the fruitful Q&A
sessions and the overall positive attitudes from all
speakers/participants revealed that the meeting reached its main
objective. To sum up, Why R? Turkey 2021 is the best comprehensive
online meeting held for Turkish R users and it promises both national
and international organizations in the near future.
