Publishing a source package on CRAN now adds the publication date and
the repository name (CRAN) to the package , and standardizes the license
specification if possible.

# CRAN package web

The CRAN package web pages (remember that these gained persistent URLs
of the form

::: center
`http://CRAN.R-project.org/package=`*`foo`*
:::

in early 2008) have again been enhanced.

If available, package citation (from , suitably HTMLified), installation
(from a top-level file), classification ( Classification/ACM,
Classification/JEL and Classification/MSC fields with subject
classifications using the Computing Classification System of the
Association for Computing Machinery, the Journal of Economic Literature
Classification System, and the Mathematics Subject Classification of the
American Mathematical Society, respectively) and language ( Language
field) information is now linked from the package web page.

In addition, the direct reverse dependencies of the package (i.e., the
CRAN packages which depend on, import, suggest or enhance the package)
are shown at the bottom of the package web page.

Standardizable license specifications are fully hyperlinked to the
respective license texts.

All CRAN (HTML) web pages should now be valid XHTML.

# New contributed packages

[*AIGIS*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=AIGIS)

:   Areal Interpolation for GIS data. Can be used to interpolate
    spatially associated data onto arbitrary target polygons which lack
    such data. Version 1.0 of the package is oriented toward convenient
    interpolation of specific US census data for California, but the
    tools provided should work for any combination of GIS data source
    and target polygon, provided appropriate care is taken. Future
    versions will be aimed at facilitating more general applications. By
    Benjamin P. Bryant and Anthony Westerling.

[*Animal*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=Animal)

:   Functions for analyzing animal (including human) behavior data
    originating from a variety of sources, including functions to
    analyze time coded behaviors from CowLog (open source software for
    coding behaviors from digital video) data files and observation
    files with similar format. Other features include hourly, daily,
    weekly and monthly summaries of time coded data, analysis of RIC
    (roughage intake system, Insentec automation) data files and
    labeling measurement data according to behavioral observations for
    e.g. model building purposes. By Matti Pastell.

[*AquaEnv*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=AquaEnv)

:   An integrated development toolbox for aquatic chemical model
    generation focused on (ocean) acidification and CO$_2$ air-water
    exchange. Contains all elements necessary to model the pH, the
    related CO$_2$ air-water exchange, as well as aquatic acid-base
    chemistry in general for an arbitrary marine, estuarine or
    freshwater system. Chemical batches can be modeled as well. In
    addition to the routines necessary to calculate desired information,
    [*AquaEnv*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=AquaEnv) also
    contains a suite of tools to visualize this. Furthermore,
    [*AquaEnv*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=AquaEnv) can not only
    be used to build dynamic models of aquatic systems, but can also
    serve as a simple desktop tool for the experimental aquatic chemist
    to generate and visualize all possible derived information from a
    set of measurements with one single easy to use R function. By
    Andreas F. Hofmann, Karline Soetaert, and Filip J. R. Meysman.

    BMA in linear models using stochastic or deterministic sampling
    without replacement from posterior distributions. Prior
    distributions on coefficients are from Zellner's $g$-prior or
    mixtures of $g$-priors corresponding to the Zellner-Siow Cauchy
    Priors or the Liang et al. hyper-$g$ priors. Other model selection
    criterion include AIC and BIC. Sampling probabilities may be updated
    based on the sampled models. By Merlise Clyde, with contributions
    from Michael Littman.

[*BGSIMD*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=BGSIMD)

:   Block Gibbs Sampler with Incomplete Multinomial Distribution.
    Implements an efficient block Gibbs sampler with incomplete data
    from a multinomial distribution taking values from the $k$
    categories $1,2,\ldots,k$, where data are assumed to miss at random
    and each missing datum belongs to one and only one of $m$ distinct
    non-empty proper subsets $A_1, A_2, \ldots, A_m$ of $1,2,\ldots,k$
    and the $k$ categories are labeled such that only consecutive $A$'s
    may overlap. By Kwang Woo Ahn and Kung-Sik Chan.

[*BMN*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=BMN)

    and Rubin. (Not all data sets yet.) Compiled by Kjetil Halvorsen.

[*BayesX*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=BayesX)

:   R Utilities Accompanying the BayesX software package for structured
    additive regression. Provides functionality for exploring and
    visualizing estimation results obtained with BayesX. Also provides
    functions that allow to read, write and manipulate map objects that
    are required in spatial analyses performed with BayesX. By Thomas
    Kneib, Felix Heinzl, Andreas Brezger, and Daniel Sabanes Bove.

[*CADFtest*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=CADFtest)

:   Performs Hansen's (1995) Covariate-Augmented Dickey-Fuller (CADF)
    test. The $p$-values of the test are computed using a procedure
    proposed in Costantini, Lupi and Popp (2007), illustrated in Lupi
    (2008). By Claudio Lupi.

[*CHNOSZ*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=CHNOSZ)

    chemical affinities of reactions between and among minerals,
    inorganic, organic, and/or biomolecular aqueous and crystalline
    species. Incorporation of an extensive database of thermodynamic
    properties of species and algorithms for computing the standard
    thermodynamic properties of neutral and ionized proteins from amino
    acid group contributions. Generation of chemical speciation and
    predominance diagrams for stable and metastable equilibrium in open
    systems as a function of temperature, pressure, and chemical
    activities or fugacities of basis species. By Jeffrey M. Dick.

[*ClinicalRobustPriors*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=ClinicalRobustPriors)

:   Robust Bayesian priors in clinical trials. Fuquene, Cook, &
    Pericchi (2008) (<http://www.bepress.com/mdandersonbiostat/paper44>)
    make a comprehensive proposal putting forward robust, heavy-tailed
    priors over conjugate, light-tailed priors in Bayesian analysis. The
    behavior of Robust Bayesian methods is qualitatively different from
    Conjugate and short tailed Bayesian methods and arguably much more
    reasonable and acceptable to the practitioner and regulatory
    agencies. This package is useful to compute the distributions
    (prior, likelihood and posterior) and moments of the robust models:
    Cauchy/Binomial, Cauchy/Normal and Berger/Normal. Both Binomial and
    Normal Likelihoods can be handled. Furthermore, allows assessment of
    the hyper-parameters and posterior analysis. By A. Jairo and P.
    Fuquene.

[*ConvCalendar*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=ConvCalendar)

:   Converts between the `"Date"` class and d/m/y for several calendars,
    including Persian, Islamic, and Hebrew. By 'Project Pluto'

    and Thomas Lumley.

[*CvM2SL1Test*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=CvM2SL1Test)

:   $L_1$ version of Cramer-von Mises two sample tests. Contains
    functions for computing the Cramer-von Mises two sample test scores
    and the exact $p$-value(s) for given test score(s) under the
    assumption that the populations under comparison have the same
    probability distribution. The $L_1$ Cramer-von Mises test, like its
    $L_2$ counterpart, is distribution-free, but of less computational
    intensity. In certain cases, this version of Cramer-von Mises test
    is almost as powerful as its $L_2$ counterpart. Simulation studies
    also show that it is more powerful than the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test
    in certain cases. By Yuanhui Xiao and Ye Cui.

:   Fast Kalman Filter. A flexible implementation entirely written in C
    and fully relying on linear algebra subroutines contained in BLAS
    and LAPACK. Due to the speed of the filter, the fitting of
    high-dimensional linear state space models to large data sets
    becomes possible. Also contains a function for the visualization of
    the state vector and graphical diagnostics of the residuals. By
    David Lüthi and Philipp Erb.

[*FSelector*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=FSelector)

:   Functions for selecting attributes from a given data set. Attribute

[*OrdFacReg*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=OrdFacReg)

:   Least squares, logistic, and Cox-regression with ordered predictors.
    In biomedical studies, researchers are often interested in assessing
    the association between one or more ordinal explanatory variables
    and an outcome variable, at the same time adjusting for covariates
    of any type. The outcome variable may be continuous, binary, or
    represent censored survival times. In the absence of a precise
    knowledge of the response function, using monotonicity constraints
    on the ordinal variables improves efficiency in estimating
    parameters, especially when sample sizes are small. This package
    implements an active set algorithm that efficiently computes such
    estimators. By Kaspar Rufibach.

[*OrdMonReg*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=OrdMonReg)

:   Compute least squares estimates of one bounded or two ordered
    antitonic regression curves. Consider the problem of estimating two
    antitonic regression curves $f_1$ and $f_2$ under the constraint
    that $f_1 \ge f_2$. Given two sets of $n$ data points
    $g_1(x_1), \ldots, g_1(x_n)$ and $g_2(x_1), \ldots, g_2(x_n)$ that
    are observed at (the same) deterministic points $x_1, \ldots, x_n$,
    the estimates are obtained by minimizing the Least Squares criterion
    $L(f_1, f_2) = \sum_{i=1}^n (g_1(x_i) - f_1(x_i))^2 w_1(x_i) +
      \sum_{i=1}^n (g_2(x_i) - f_2(x_i))^2 w_2(x_i)$ over the class of
    pairs of functions $(f_1, f_2)$ such that $f_1$ and $f_2$ are
    antitonic and $f_1(x_i) \ge f_2(x_i)$ for all $i = 1, \ldots, n$.
    The estimates are computed with a projected subgradient algorithm
    where the projection is calculated using a PAVA. By Fadoua
    Balabdaoui, Kaspar Rufibach, and Filippo Santambrogio.

:   Performs Penalized Multivariate Analysis: a penalized matrix
    decomposition, sparse principal components analysis, and sparse
    canonical correlation analysis, described in "A penalized matrix
    decomposition, with applications to sparse principal components and
    canonical correlation analysis" by Witten, Tibshirani and Hastie
    (2009). By Daniela Witten and Rob Tibshirani.

[*influence.ME*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=influence.ME)

:   A collection of tools for calculating measures of influential data
    for mixed effects models. The basic rationale behind identifying
    influential data is that when iteratively single units are omitted
    from the data, models based on these data should not produce
    substantially different estimates. To standardize the assessment of
    how influential a (single group of) observation(s) is, several
    measures of influence are common practice. First, DFBETAS is a
    standardized measure of the absolute difference between the estimate
    with a particular case included and the estimate without that
    particular case. Second, Cook's distance provides an overall
    measurement of the change in all parameter estimates, or a selection
    thereof. By Rense Nieuwenhuis, Ben Pelzer, and Manfred te
    Grotenhuis.
