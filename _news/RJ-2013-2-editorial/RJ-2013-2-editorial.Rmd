::: article
Welcome to volume 5, issue 2 of The R Journal. I'm very pleased to
include 21 articles about R for your enjoyment.

The end of the year also brings changes to the editorial board. Martyn
Plummer is leaving the board after four years. Martyn was responsible
for writing up the standard operating procedures for the journal, an act
which has made my life as a new editor considerably easier! We welcome
Michael Lawrence, who will join the editorial board in 2014. I am
stepping down as Editor-in-Chief and will be leaving this task in the
capable hands of Deepayan Sarkar.
