# R 4.2.0 selected changes

R 4.2.0 (codename "Vigorous Calisthenics") was released on 2022-04-22.
The December 2021 (13/2) issue of the R Journal provided a selection of
the most important changes in that release that were already settled at
that time, including:

-   R on Windows uses UTF-8 as the native encoding, uses the new
    Universal C Runtime (UCRT) and a new toolchain (Rtools42).
-   R on Windows changed the default library location and the default
    installation location for user-only installation to match current
    Windows conventions.
-   Support for isolated groups, compositing operators, affine
    transformations, and stroking and filling paths has been added to
    the R graphics engine.
-   R now provides an R-level interface for hash tables.

A selection of the remaining important R 4.2.0 changes is provided here.

-   The HTML help system has several new features: LaTeX-like math can
    be typeset using either [KaTeX](https://katex.org/) or
    [MathJax](https://www.mathjax.org/), usage and example code is
    highlighted using [Prism](https://prismjs.com), and for dynamic help
    the output of examples and demos can be shown within the browser if
    the [*knitr*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=knitr) package is
    installed. (These features can be disabled by setting the
    environment variable `_R_HELP_ENABLE_ENHANCED_HTML_` to a false
    value.)
    The HTML help system now uses HTML5, the current HTML standard,
    which in particular helps to facilitate some of the enhancements
    described above. Considerable effort was put into ensuring *valid*
    HTML5 output. The old validation toolchain could not handle HTML5,
    so a new one was created based on [HTML
    Tidy](https://www.html-tidy.org/) and integrated into the *tools*
    package. `R CMD check` can now optionally (but included in
    `–as-cran`) validate the package HTML help files.

    See
    <https://blog.r-project.org/2022/04/08/enhancements-to-html-documentation/>
    for more information.
-   Calling `if()` or `while()` with a condition of length greater than
    one now gives an error rather than a warning. Consequently,
    environment variable `_R_CHECK_LENGTH_1_CONDITION_` no longer has
    any effect. Similarly, calling `&&` or `||` with either argument of
    length greater than one now gives a warning. In R 4.3.0, it will
    give an error, and environment variable `_R_CHECK_LENGTH_1_LOGIC2_`
    will no longer have any effect.
-   The *grid* package now allows the user to specify a *vector* of
    pattern fills. The `fill` argument to `gpar()` accepts a list of
    gradients and/or patterns and the functions `linearGradient()`,
    `radialGradient()`, and `pattern()` have a new `group` argument.
    Finally, points grobs (data symbols) can now also have a pattern
    fill.
    See
    <https://blog.r-project.org/2022/06/09/vectorised-patterns-in-r-graphics/>
    for more information.
-   In `lhs |> rhs` expressions using the native pipe operator it is now
    possible to use a named argument with the placeholder `_` in the
    `rhs` call to specify where the `lhs` is to be inserted. The
    placeholder can only appear once on the `rhs`.
-   On Windows, `download.file(method = "auto")` and
    `url(method = "default")` now follow Unix in using `"libcurl"` for
    all except `file://` URIs. This impacts, for example, updating of R
    packages (HTTPS downloads). Most users should not notice, but an
    additional proxy setup may be required (see
    `help("download.file")`). Also, `"libcurl"` is by the decision of
    the library authors stricter in checking certificate revocation than
    the previous `"wininet"` method. This brings more security, but also
    may cause trouble with some corporate HTTPS MITM proxies, which
    filter HTTPS traffic. R-patched (to become R 4.2.2) has a
    work-around via environment variable
    `R_LIBCURL_SSL_REVOKE_BEST_EFFORT`.

# R 4.2.1 and R-patched changes on Windows

R 4.2.0 on Windows switched to UTF-8 as the native encoding and to UCRT
as the Windows runtime. R is an early adopter of UCRT in the open-source
community of projects compiled using free and open-source compilers, and
particularly an early adopter of UTF-8 as the native encoding on
Windows, hence this came with considerable effort and risk of bugs.
Hence, testing using CRAN package checks has been in place for over a
year before the release (and 9 months of that time in parallel to the
usual CRAN checks when R-devel still used MSVCRT as the C runtime).

Still, some issues not covered by such tests, mostly in interactive use
and `Rgui`, have been reported by users after the 4.2 release and have
been fixed in R-patched. R users on Windows should update to the latest
available patch version.

Selected fixes in R 4.2.1:

-   Accent keys now work in GraphApp Unicode windows, which are used by
    `Rgui` whenever running in a multi-byte locale (so also in UTF-8),
    hence fixing a regression for users of systems where R 4.1 used a
    single-byte locale. This was one of the bugs already present in
    GraphApp, but never reported before, e.g., by users of other
    multi-byte locales.
-   Text injection from external applications via `SendInput` now works
    in GraphApp Unicode windows, fixing a regression in R 4.2.0 for
    `Rgui` users of systems where R 4.1 used a single-byte locale but
    R 4.2.0 uses UTF-8. Text injection is used via applications such as
    Dasher, which helps people with hand impairment to enter text, and
    by general GUIs that prefer to use a standalone `Rgui` window over
    embedding R. This was another old bug in GraphApp impacting
    multi-byte locales. Some other applications injecting text via
    sending Windows window messages such as `WM_CHAR` directly to `Rgui`
    should switch to injection via `SendInput`, which is the proper
    injection method on Windows and the switch should not be difficult.
    Allowing injection via `WM_CHAR` even in a multi-byte locale would
    require too big changes in GraphApp.
-   A regression in writing to the clipboard connection has been fixed.
    That code had to be rewritten for the UTF-8 transition, but the new
    version had a bug which prevented writing text in consecutive
    operations.
-   `getlocale` has been fixed to also work with strict checking of
    invalid arguments to the C runtime. These are normally disabled in
    applications built using Rtools, but it impacted embedded use in
    RStudio with the [*rJava*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=rJava)
    package, causing crashes by default. This issue was related to
    switching to UCRT, which is stricter in checking the validity of
    function arguments (it was not directly related to UTF-8 nor the
    locale).
-   The script editor in `Rgui` has been fixed to work with UTF-8: some
    operations (such as running a line of code from the editor in the R
    console) before did not work with non-ASCII characters, with a
    regression in R 4.2.0 (in earlier versions one could work at least
    with non-ASCII characters representable in the current locale).
    These issues are related to at least surprising behavior of the
    underlying Windows component used for the editor with UTF-8 as the
    native (ANSI) encoding: one would think that no change would be
    needed for the transition from a non-UTF-8 native encoding to UTF-8
    here. Users of the script editor have to convert their scripts with
    non-ASCII characters to UTF-8 before reading them in R 4.2.1 or
    newer (on recent Windows where UTF-8 is used), and they should
    upgrade to R 4.2.2 when it is available.

Selected fixes in R-patched, to become R 4.2.2:

-   `Rterm` support for `Alt+xxx` sequences has been fixed to produce
    the corresponding character (only) once. This fixes pasting text
    that includes tilde on Italian keyboard; without the fix, tilde may
    appear twice, depending on the Windows console program used. This
    was a regression introduced by an earlier rewrite of `Rterm` for
    supporting multi-width characters. That change was part of the
    transition to UTF-8, but already included in R 4.1.
-   Find and replace operations work again in the script editor in
    `Rgui`.

The bug reports have revealed that `Rgui` is frequently used, including
by users with visual or hand impairments who find `Rgui` working well
with assistive technologies.

The bugs were fixed promptly in R-patched. Impacted users may install a
snapshot of R-patched in case waiting for the next release would be too
limiting.

# R 4.2.0 code statistics

From the source code Subversion repository, the overall change between
May 18, 2021 and April 22, 2022 (so between R 4.1.0 and R 4.2.0) was:
29,000 added lines, 20,000 deleted lines and 900 changed files. This is
rounded to thousands/hundreds and excludes changes to common generated
files, bulk re-organizations, etc. (translations, parsers, Autoconf,
LAPACK, R Journal bibliography, test outputs, Unicode tables,
incorporated M4 macros, BLAS, KaTeX files). This is about 10% fewer
additions and changed files and about 43% more deletions than between
R 4.0.0 and R 4.1.0, see News and Notes from the June 2021 issue of the
R Journal.

Figure [1](#fig:svn42) shows commits by month and weekday, respectively,
counting line-based changes in individual commits, excluding the files
as above. The statistics are computed the same way as in the June 2021
issue, hence allowing direct comparisons. However, monthly statistics
are impacted by the release date which varies across versions, so the
numbers for April and May are somewhat biased. The statistics cover code
directly committed to the trunk, plus commits from the merged branches
*R-groups*, *R-vecpat*. *R-ucrt* and *R-structure*. Statistics are based
on the dates of the original commits in the branches, which includes
commits from April 2021 (*R-groups*).
