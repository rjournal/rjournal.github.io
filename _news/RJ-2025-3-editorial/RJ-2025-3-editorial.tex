On behalf of the editorial board, I am pleased to present Volume 17 Issue 3 of the R Journal. This issue features eleven research articles, plus news from CRAN, BioConductor and the R Foundation.

The articles discuss various R packages that have been developed, covering a wide range of topics. Each article provides an overview of the package, its functionality, and examples of its use. All packages discussed are available on CRAN. Supplementary material with fully reproducible code is available for download from the Journal website.
