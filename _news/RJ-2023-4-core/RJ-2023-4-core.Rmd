# Selected changes in R-devel

R 4.4.0 is due to be released around April 2024.  The following gives a
selection of changes in R-devel, which are likely to appear in the new
release.
The summaries below include text contributed by authors of some of the
changes: Peter Dalgaard, Martyn Plummer, Brian Ripley, Deepayan Sarkar and
Luke Tierney.

- The `anova()` function is used for analysis of variance for linear models
  and analysis of deviance for generalized linear models (GLMs).  Previously
  the `anova()` function behaved differently for GLMs: it would not show
  test statistics and p-values by default, instead relying on the user to
  specify the required test statistic.  Thanks to changes to `"family"`
  objects already included in R 4.3.0, the `anova()` function can now
  determine an appropriate default test for comparing two GLMs (`"LRT"` for
  families with a fixed dispersion parameter and `"F"` for families with free
  dispersion) and will show this along with the associated p-value.

- As part of the process of allowing the use of Rao's score test in
  connection with `glm()`, the `confint()` method for `"glm"` objects now
  allows `test = "Rao"`, as does the underlying `profile()` method.  To enable
  this, the code for these functions, and also the corresponding `plot()`
  and `pairs()` methods, was copied from the \pkg{MASS} package to the R sources
  before modification.  The `pairs()` method has also been revised to better
  handle the case where only a subset of parameters have been profiled.

- R 4.4.0 will include support for producing single-page HTML reference
  manuals for an entire package, similar to the PDF reference manuals
  currently hosted on CRAN package pages.  It will also include support for
  a table of contents in HTML help pages, which is controlled by
  `options("help.htmltoc")`.

- R 4.3.0 added support for experimenting with alternate object systems by
  providing the `chooseOpsMethod()` generic for resolving method selection for
  `Ops` group generics, and the `nameOfClass()` generic to allow more flexible
  class representations to be used in `inherits()`.  In addition, `@` became
  an internal generic, `@<-` already was.  R 4.4.0 will add internal support
  for bare objects by renaming the `S4SXP` type to `OBJSXP` and having
  `typeof()` return `"object"` for generic bare objects.  For now, generic
  bare S4 objects are distinguished by having a special bit set; it is
  hoped that this can eventually be dropped.

- R relies on the system libiconv for encoding conversions, especially from
  UTF-8.  Apple replaced completely its libiconv in macOS 14 with
  substantial revisions in 14.1 and 14.2: rather than reporting errors when
  an exact conversion is not possible, it in almost all cases attempts
  'transliteration' so for example permille ("‰") is rendered as "o/oo".

  musl (as used by Alpine Linux) has long substituted "*", but we now faced
  converted strings growing in length.  Issues were particularly seen when
  plotting on `pdf()` devices and it became clear many package authors had
  never looked at their graphical output.  That suggested that
  transliteration was a safer route, and now R transliterates if the system
  libiconv has not got there first and so (except in rare cases and under
  musl) R will give the same PDF output on all platforms.

- `Rprof()`, the sampling profiler in R, now supports profiling in "elapsed"
  time (a.k.a. wall-clock time, real-time) on Unix in addition to "cpu" time.
  When profiling in elapsed time, the time advances also while R is waiting
  on I/O, so it may be preferred for some kinds of analysis in I/O intensive
  applications.  Also, elapsed time profiling is the only one currently
  supported on Windows, so it is good to have a matching option on Unix.

- R gained initial support for 64-bit ARM hardware on Windows (macOS and
  Linux machines are already supported).  It is already possible to build R
  and recommended packages from source and they pass their automated checks. 
  Testing and porting of other CRAN packages has been started, with a number
  of patches contributed to package maintainers.  This effort uses an
  experimental LLVM-based toolchain with the new flang compiler, which has
  been added to Rtools.  In addition to actually supporting 64-bit ARM
  Windows machines, which are still rare but emerging, this effort also
  drives portability improvements of R and R packages. Previously, a lot of
  this code explicitly or implicitly assumed GCC compilers and Intel CPUs on
  Windows.

- The `R CMD check` utility for package development performs some additional
  checks on R documentation (`Rd`) files. The most prominent addition (in
  the sense that over 3000 CRAN packages were affected) is a new note
  about "lost braces". In (LaTeX-like) Rd syntax,
  braces are used to mark arguments and otherwise group tokens; they must
  be escaped as `\{` and `\}` to be included literally in normal text.
  The new check tries hard to report relevant mistakes, for example:
  - `code{...}`: missing backslash in front of the macro name
  - `{1, 2}`: in-text set notation, where the braces need escaping or
    the whole expression needs to be put inside a math `\eqn{}`
  - `\itemize{ ... \item{label}{description} ... }`: Rd code meant as a
    description list with initial labels; this needs `\describe` instead
    of `\itemize`, otherwise the element becomes "labeldescription" because
    an `\itemize` `\item` does not take any arguments.

- A new binary infix operator `%||%` is defined in **base**.
  This is the so-called *null coalescing operator*:
  `x %||% y` expresses "use `x` if not `NULL`, otherwise use `y`".

- `is.atomic(NULL)` now returns `FALSE` and thus behaves according to
  the R language definition of an atomic vector (`RShowDoc("R-lang")`,
  Section 2.1.1), which covers the six basic types `logical`, `integer`,
  `double`, `complex`, `character` and `raw`.
  For historical reasons (compatibility with S), `is.atomic(NULL)` gave
  `TRUE` in R < 4.4.0, treating `NULL` loosely as "any vector of size 0".
  Similarly, `NCOL(NULL)` returned 1 but now gives 0.

- There is a new startup option `--max-connections` to set the maximum
  number of connections for the R session.  It defaults to 128 as before. 
  Values up to 4096 are allowed, but resource limits may in practice
  restrict to smaller values. This enables advanced users to configure R
  in environments where a large number of connections (e.g., network) is
  needed.

- R 4.4.0 on recent Windows will use the new Segment Heap allocator provided
  by the system.  This new allocator has slightly better performance on some
  applications than the default Low Fragmentation Heap allocator, with the
  hope that it would be further improved in future versions of Windows.

- R makes use of a system libdeflate library if available, in preference to
  the system libz library. This can speed up decompressing R objects in
  lazy-loading databases and other operations.

# Bug statistics for 2023

<!-- Compared to counts from past reports:
year  new  closed  comments  contributors
2020  338     364      1560           157
2021  244     220      1065           115
2022  180     171       869           123
2023  186     204       942           120
-->

Summaries of bug-related activities over the past year were derived from the
database underlying [R's Bugzilla system](https://bugs.R-project.org/).
Overall, 186 new bugs or requests for enhancements were reported,
204 reports were closed, and 942 comments were added
by a total of 120 contributors.
The numbers of new reports and contributors were comparable to 2022,
but comments increased by 8% and closures by 20%.
Higher activity in 2023 was driven by a dedicated effort
in reviewing and discussing open reports during the R Project Sprint
at the University of Warwick, UK, 30 August to 1 September
[@RJ-2023-3-sprint].

```{r bzstats-mon, out.width = "80%", fig.align = "center", fig.cap = "Bug tracking activity by month in 2023.", fig.alt = "Barplots of the number of opened bugs, closed bugs and bug comments by month."}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/bzstats-mon.png", auto_pdf = TRUE)
```

Figure \@ref(fig:bzstats-mon) shows the monthly numbers of
new reports, closures and comments in 2023.
Comment activity was relatively low in July and peaked in September
due to the sprint.

The top 5 components reporters have chosen for their reports were
"Low-level", "Misc", "Language", "Documentation", and "Accuracy".
9% of the reports were suggestions for
enhancements that were submitted either in the "Wishlist" component or in a
specific component but with severity level set to "enhancement".

<!--
From the numbers in Figure \@ref(fig:bzstats-wd) we see that the R
community is also active during weekends, though at a lower frequency.
