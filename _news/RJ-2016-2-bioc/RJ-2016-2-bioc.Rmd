::: article
The [Bioconductor](https://bioconductor.org) project provides tools for
the analysis and comprehension of high-throughput genomic data.
Bioconductor 3.4 was released on 18 October, 2016. It is compatible with
R 3.3 and consists of 1296 software packages, 309 experiment data
packages, and 933 up-to-date annotation packages. The [release
announcement](http://bioconductor.org/news/bioc_3_4_release/) includes
descriptions of 101 new packages, and updated NEWS files for many
additional packages. Start using Bioconductor by installing the most
recent version of R and evaluating the commands

``` r
  source("https://bioconductor.org/biocLite.R")
  biocLite()
```

Install additional packages and dependencies, e.g.,
[*AnnotationHub*](https://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/AnnotationHub.html),
with

``` r
  BiocInstaller::biocLite("AnnotationHub")
```

[Docker](http://www.bioconductor.org/help/docker/) and
[Amazon](http://www.bioconductor.org/help/bioconductor-cloud-ami/)
images provide a very effective on-ramp for power users to rapidly
obtain access to standardized and scalable computing environments. Key
resources include:

-   [bioconductor.org](https://bioconductor.org) to install, learn, use,
    and develop Bioconductor packages.

-   A listing of [available
    software](https://bioconductor.org/packages), linked to pages
    describing each package.

-   A question-and-answer style [user support
    site](https://support.bioconductor.org) and developer-oriented
    [mailing list](https://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/bioc-devel).

-   The [F1000Research Bioconductor
    channel](https://f1000research.com/channels/bioconductor) for
    peer-reviewed Bioconductor work flows.

-   Our [package
    submission](https://github.com/Bioconductor/Contributions)
    repository for open technical review of new packages.

Our annual conference, [BioC 2017: Where Software and Biology
Connect](https://bioconductor.org/help/course-materials/2017/BioC2017/),
will be on June 26 ('developer day'), 27 and 28, in Boston, MA.
