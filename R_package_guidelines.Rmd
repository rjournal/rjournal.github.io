title: "R Package guidelines"

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = FALSE)
```

```{css, echo = FALSE}
d-article > * {
    grid-column: page;
}
```

R Journal articles that describe R packages should follow these guidelines.

### Requirements for consideration

* The package must be available on CRAN or Bioconductor.
* The content of the package should be substantial and would likely be of significant interest and use within the R community.
* The accompanying paper should clearly demonstrate the use of the package and its advantages over any competing packages or existing approaches. 
* The package must include unit tests to verify functionality.
* Each user-facing function must be fully documented with all terms and arguments explained, and examples provided. 
* Include a vignette describing a full workflow or example analysis
* Use a version control system (e.g., GitHub, GitLab, BitBucket, R-Forge)

### Recommended best practices

In addition, we strongly recommend that package authors follow common R package conventions, including but not limited to:

* Offer a bug reporting mechanism, such as GitHub issues.
* Use a consistent naming scheme for functions (e.g., snake_case or camelCase).  
* Follow a consistent code style, such as the [tidyverse](https://style.tidyverse.org/) or [Google](https://google.github.io/styleguide/Rguide.html) style guides. A code formatter such as [Air](https://posit-dev.github.io/air/) or [styler](https://styler.r-lib.org/) can help enforce consistent style.
* Use object-oriented programming where appropriate (e.g., define `plot()` or `print()` S3 methods for custom classes).  
* Use `message()` or `warning()` instead of `cat()` or `print()` within functions (except in `print` methods).  
* Avoid reading or writing files unless essential to the package's purpose.  
* Use `TRUE` and `FALSE` explicitly; avoid `T` and `F` as values or variable names.  
* If the package contains data, include a data-raw directory with code for data generation or cleaning.  
* Make documentation available on a standalone website online (e.g., via [pkgdown](https://pkgdown.r-lib.org/)).
