```

R Journal articles that describe R packages should follow these guidelines:

* The package must be available on CRAN or Bioconductor.
* There must be a proper version control system in place. e.g., the package could be housed on GitHub, GitLab or BitBucket.
* There should be a bug reporting mechanism in place, e.g., GitHub issues or similar.
* Include unit tests to ensure the package works as expected. The [testthat](https://testthat.r-lib.org/) package is a good choice for this.
* Functions should use a consistent naming scheme, e.g., snake_case or camelCase.
* Code should follow a consistent style, e.g., use [Air](https://posit-dev.github.io/air/) or follow the [tidyverse style guide](https://style.tidyverse.org/).
* Each user-facing function must be fully documented with all terms and arguments explained, and examples provided. Even better would be an additional vignette describing the full workflow for an analysis using the package. 
* Use object-oriented programming where appropriate. For example, if you have a special plotting function, consider implementing a class and defining a `plot()` method for it. If your package creates large list objects, add a class and a suitable `print` method.
* Use `message()` or `warning()` rather than `cat()` or `print()` within functions (other than `print` methods).
* Avoid saving output to files unless it is really necessary.
* Avoid reading input from files, unless you are providing a function to read a new type of file format.
* Use `TRUE` not `T`, and `FALSE` not `F`, and avoid using `T` and `F` as variable names.
* If your package contains data, include a data-raw folder containing code for reproducing the data objects. See https://r-pkgs.org/data.html
* Follow common R package conventions as much as possible.
* Having the code documentation available online is desirable, e.g., as a [pkgdown](https://pkgdown.r-lib.org/) site on GitHub pages.
