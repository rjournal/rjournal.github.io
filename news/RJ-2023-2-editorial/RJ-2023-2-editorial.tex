\maketitle


On behalf of the editorial board, I am pleased to present Volume 15 Issue 2 of the R Journal.

Behind the scenes, several people assist with the journal operations. Mitchell O'Hara-Wild continues to work on infrastructure, H. Sherry Zhang continues to develop the \CRANpkg{rjtools} package under the direction of Professor Dianne Cook. In addition, articles in this issue have been carefully copy edited by Adam Bartonicek and Chase Robertson.
