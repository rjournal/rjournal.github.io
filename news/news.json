    "contents": "\n1 CRAN growth\nIn the past 5 months, 866 new packages were\nadded to the CRAN package repository. 332 packages\nwere unarchived, 701 were archived and\n5 had to be removed. The following shows the\ngrowth of the number of active packages in the CRAN package repository:\n\n\n\nOn 2023-09-30, the number of active packages was around 19932.\n2 Changes in the CRAN Repository Policy\nThe Policy now links to an\naccompanying document on Using Rust in CRAN packages.\n\n3 CRAN package submissions\nFrom May 2023 to September 2023\nCRAN received 12237 package submissions.\nFor these, 20527 actions took place of which\n14006 (68%) were auto processed actions and\n6521 (32%) manual actions.\nMinus some special cases, a summary of the auto-processed and manually\ntriggered actions follows:\n\n\narchive\ninspect\nnewbies\npending\npretest\npublish\nrecheck\nwaiting\nauto\n3677\n1889\n2460\n0\n0\n3734\n1282\n964\nmanual\n2378\n186\n431\n317\n52\n2423\n599\n135\n\nThese include the final decisions for the submissions which were\n\n\narchive\npublish\nauto\n3573 (29.7%)\n3246 (27%)\nmanual\n2337 (19.4%)\n2883 (23.9%)\n\nwhere we only count those as auto processed whose publication or\nrejection happened automatically in all steps.\n4 CRAN mirror security\nCurrently, there are 94 official CRAN mirrors,\n76 of which provide both\nsecure downloads via ‘https’ and use secure mirroring from the CRAN master\n(via rsync through ssh tunnels).

    "contents": "\nSoftware\nBioconductor version 3.18 was released on Oct 25 2023. The system is compatible with R 4.3. See the release announcement for full details. Noteworthy additions since our last report to the R Journal include\na BSgenome package for the telomere-to-telomere build of the\nhuman genome (Aganezov et al. (2022)),\nthe SparseArray package for overcoming the limit on the number of non-zero elements allowable in a sparse Matrix instance,\nBiocBook, a package to facilitate the creation of package-based, versioned online books authored in Quarto,\na pair of Annotation packages with the the AlphaMissense (Cheng et al. (2023)) pathogenicity scores\nfor coding variants in the human genome for builds hg19 and\nhg38.\nSee the release announcement for full details.\nThe growth of the package repertory is greatly aided by a group of committed\nand energetic reviewers. All reviews are conducted in github issues streams\nat contributions.bioconductor.org/issues.\nInfrastructure\nNational Science Foundation ACCESS Award BIR190004 provides\nsignificant compute resources in the Jetstream2 academic cloud along with storage provided by the Open Storage Network.\nThese resources form the basis for the\nGalaxy/Kubernetes-backed Bioconductor workshop platform\noriginally known as Orchestra.\nWorkshop submissions are now\naccepted through a Shiny app made available at the platform site.\nThe “BuildABiocWorkshop”\ntemplate has been updated\nwith GitHub Actions, and now uses the GitHub Container Registry (ghcr.io)\nAt present, Bioconductor 3.18 packages are tested regularly on\nUbuntu 22.04, macOS 13.6 (arm64), macOS 12.7 (x86_64), and Windows\nServer 2022 Datacenter. Testing of packages in the devel branch\nincludes an arm64 Linux platform (openEuler 22.03) thanks to efforts\nof Martin Grigorov and Yikun Jiang.\nDocker container updates\nAn active effort to revamp the Bioconductor Docker stack is in progress, maintaining backwards compatibility, but featuring a number of new capabilities. Notably, all containers are now published both on\nDockerHub as well as the\nGitHub Container Registry (GHCR), so any container previously pulled as bioconductor/bioconductor_docker for example, can now also be pulled from GHCR as ghcr.io/bioconductor/bioconductor_docker.\nAdditionally, the traditional rstudio-based containers, previously published under the bioconductor/bioconductor_docker name, are now also available under the bioconductor/bioconductor name, eliminating the need to type the _docker suffix. Moreover, release tags can still be used as “RELEASE_3_18” as before, but the simpler “3.18” tag now suffices. The latest rstudio-based container can thus now be pulled as docker pull bioconductor/bioconductor:3.18 and will be identical to bioconductor/bioconductor_docker:RELEASE_3_18.\nBioconductor now has containers built on top of different flavors of rocker such as bioconductor/r-ver container, a slimmer container with R but not RStudio, and bioconductor/ml-verse, featuring tidyverse and some GPU drivers pre-installed. These and more container flavors can be found at DockerHub and GitHub.\nBioc2u alpha release\nUcar and Eddelbuettel (2021) discuss motivations and methods for distributing precompiled R packages via\nLinux system package managers.\nBioconductor has recently undergone an effort to make a full package repository of Bioconductor packages and their dependencies available via apt on Ubuntu systems. Building on top of previous work from the Debian r-pkg-team and the r2u project, the Bioc2u repository currently offers 3708 packages for the Bioconductor 3.18 release for Ubuntu Jammy. More information can be found at https://github.com/bioconductor/bioc2u, and alpha testers are welcome to join the #bioc2u channel on the Bioconductor Community Slack.\nDeveloper support \nBioconductor is developing containers similar to the Bioconductor Linux build machines. BBS containers are configured like the build machines and aim to provide a comparable experience for developers to troubleshoot issues observed on the linux build machines. The 3.18 BBS container is available for testing with\ndocker pull ghcr.io/bioconductor/bioconductor_salt:jammy-bioc-3.18-r-4.3.2\nFuture work on the BBS containers will focus on testing the container’s performance\nin comparison to the linux build machine, building the devel container, and\nincorporating the container in a GitHub Action Workflow.\nUser support\nThanks to support from the Chan-Zuckerberg Initiative Essential Open Source Software\nfor Science program, the web site at bioconductor.org has been extensively revised.\nPartnering with Outreachy\nBioconductor mentored three interns in the May - August 2023 Outreachy cohort. Outreachy partners with open source and open science organizations to create paid open source internships to individuals underrepresented in technology. The organization, which recently celebrated surpassing 1000 interns, funded the interns for three Bioconductor-mentored projects through their general fund. Interns are selected based on the contributions they make to projects as part of their final application.\nAtrayee Samanta, an undergraduate student at IIEST Shibpur, India, curated microbiome studies for BugSigDB, a comprehensive database of published microbial signatures. Daena Rys, a computer science student from Cameroon, worked on issues within the miaverse, an ecosystem based on (Tree)SummarizedExperiment for microbiome bioinformatics. Sonali Kumari, an IGDTUW student from New Dehli, India, converted Sweave vignettes in Bioconductor packages to R Markdown for Sweave2Rmd. You can read more about their experiences on the Bioconductor blog at Our Journey as Outreachy Interns with Bioconductor.\nOutreachy will also fund three internships with Bioconductor for the December 2023 - March 2024 Outreachy cohort. Chioma Onyido, Ester Afuape, and Peace Sandy of Nigeria will curate microbiome studies for BugSigDB.\n\n\n\nS. Aganezov, S. M. Yan, D. C. Soto, M. Kirsche, S. Zarate, P. Avdeyev, D. J. Taylor, K.

    "contents": "\n1 Introduction\nR Project Sprint 2023 was a three-day event hosted at the University of Warwick,\nUK. The aim of the event was to bring novice and experienced contributors\ntogether to work collaboratively with members of the R Core Team, who\nmaintain and develop the code and documentation that forms the base\ndistribution of R (“base R”).\n2 Participants\nAll members of the R Core Team were invited to the event and 11 were\nable to participate. Another 13 participants were invited/pre-selected - these\nincluded local organizers, representatives from sponsors, and experienced\ncontributors. The remaining 31 participants - along with a few more who were\nultimately unable to participate - were selected from a pool of 71\nself-nominated applicants. Figure 1 shows group photos taken\non Day 2 and Day 3 of the sprint, a full list of participants is on the sprint website. Participation was in-person by default,\nbut exceptions were made in a few cases where travel was not possible, e.g.,\ndue to visa issues. The number online was higher than anticipated due to\ntravel disruptions; in the end seven people participated online.\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Photos of sprint participants on Day 2 (top) and Day 3 (bottom) including online participants on screen (not all participants photographed).\n\n\n\nMembers of demographic groups underrepresented within the contributor community\nwere encouraged to apply for a place, by promoting the event to affinity groups (R-Ladies, MiR, RainbowR, AfricaR, ArabR, AsiaR, and LatinR) and by direct\ncommunication with potential participants. Figure 2 shows the\ngeographical distribution of all 55 participants. There were 16 from Europe with 8 from the UK; 13 from North America with 12 from the USA;\n7 from Asia with 5 from India; 6 from Latin America with 3 from Argentina; 5 from Africa with 2 from Nigeria; 4 from Oceania - all from New Zealand, and 3 from the Middle East.\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Choropleth showing the distribution of participants on the world map.\n\n\n\nWe have further information from the nomination form, which was completed by 40 of the 44 invited/selected contributors. Over half (25/40) self-identified as belonging to one or more underrepresented groups. Figure 3 summarises the skills of these contributors as assessed by the selection committee, using data from the nomination forms. A “contributor level” was assigned based on self-ratings of familiarity with relevant concepts and processes, along with answers to free text questions about the applicant’s experience and motivation.\nThe committee deliberately selected participants to achieve the balance shown in\nthe first plot of Figure 3: an equal number of advanced and\nnovice contributors, with the remainder having intermediate expertise. The second\nplot summarises the potential for contribution to translations: 14 of\nthe selected contributors expressed a specific interest in translation; 8 more\nwere surmised to have potential based on country of residence. For the\nremainder (22) there was no evidence as we did not ask about this explicitly in the form.\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Skills of external contributors as judged by the selection committee. Left: level of expertise in R contribution. Right: potential as a translator of English to other languages.\n\n\n\n3 Preparation\nThere were two sides to preparation for the sprint: gathering suitable tasks to\nwork on and helping participants brush up their knowledge and skills.\nWe collected ideas for suitable tasks via the discussion forum on the R Project Sprint 2023 GitHub\nrepository (GitHub Discussions).\nThis provided a space for participating members of R Core to give\nfeedback and for participating contributors to express an interest. Sprint\nparticipants could propose a project by adding a page to the Projects\nsection of the sprint website. In the run up to the sprint, ideas and projects\nwere transferred to issues on the sprint GitHub repository\nalong with further last-minute ideas from core developers and members of the R Contribution Working Group (RCWG). This enabled participants to assign themselves to\nissues and provided a way to track tasks during the sprint.\nIn the lead-up to the sprint, participants were\npointed to resources created by the R Core Team and the RCWG,\nincluding the R Blog post on reviewing bugs and\nthe useR! 2021 tutorials on analysing bugs/contributing patches and\ntranslating messages in R. In addition, participants were encouraged to engage with relevant events,\nin particular the Debugging in R tutorial run\nby Shannon Pileggi for R-Ladies Remote, and the C Book Club for R Contributors and\nR Contributor Office Hours\nrun by the RCWG.\nBy the time of the sprint, participants were expected to be able to build R\nfrom source on the laptop they brought along. People new to this were\npointed to the R-admin manual,\nthe R Dev Guide and the\nprototype GitHub Codespace which\nprovides a virtual environment in which to build R - this was demonstrated in\none of the contributor office hours.\n4 Format\nThe sprint began with a hybrid evening welcome event where Martyn Plummer gave some opening remarks on contributing to the R Project, then participants split into small groups to chat with a member of R Core. An informal drinks reception then followed for in-person participants.\nEach sprint day started with a kick-off session and ended with a report-back session, both hybrid to include our online participants. On the first day, R Core members gave short talks in these sessions, introducing themselves and their work for the R Project, and laying out their broad interests for work during the sprint. Beyond these introductions, participants used the daily kick-off sessions to collectively match people to tasks.\nThe remaining day time was spent working in small groups, sometimes arranging\nhybrid meetings to discuss specific issues.\nOn the second evening, in-person participants enjoyed a conference dinner, whilst on the final evening the sprint participants joined the Warwick R User Group for a hybrid meetup to present progress made thus far at the sprint, this was followed by a buffet dinner for in-person participants.\n5 Translation\nTranslating English messages into other languages to enhance\nlocalization of R was a core activity at the sprint.\nIn 2022, Gergely Daróczi set up a prototype Weblate instance https://translate.rx.studio to provide a modern, user-friendly interface for contributing translations to the R Project. Under the RCWG, he has developed and maintained this service, working with Michael Lawrence of R Core to incorporate translations submitted via Weblate into the R sources. Sprint participants created a new\nset of guidelines for translators and\na new section in the R Dev Guide on How to contribute new translations. Several new features were enabled on the Weblate instance,\nincluding translation memory, hyperlinking to the source string location and\ndedicated reviewers to approve translations. New components were added, so that\nthe instance not only covers base R (messages, warnings, errors and the\nWindows GUI), but also the Mac GUI and recommended packages.\nFigure 4 gives a summary of activity on Weblate during\nthe sprint: around 2000 messages were changed over 14 languages. The\nvast majority of this activity can be attributed to the sprint\ndirectly or indirectly - the Hungarian translations were imported from earlier\nwork in 2011 and the Turkish translations were made by external contributors\nafter the Mac GUI component was added.\n\n\n\nFigure 4: Changes in the R Project components on Weblate during the three days of the sprint\n\n\n\n6 Code and Documentation\nThe remaining activity at the sprint related to code and documentation in base R.\nCode issues were split into topics to help organize work groups:\naccessibility, graphics, packages, statistics, translation and low-level. The\ntranslation issues here related to infrastructure maintained by the R Core Team, as opposed to Weblate. The low-level topic was a catch-all that covered utility\nfunctions and/or issues that required advanced technical expertise, e.g., in C.\nFigure 5 shows the progress of issues at the end of the sprint\nand two months after. An issue is considered closed if a corresponding bug report on R’s Bugzilla (https://bugs.r-project.org) was closed, if a corresponding patch was committed to base R, or if the issue was closed by an update to a CRAN package. By the end of the sprint, ten issues had been closed. Seven of these were documentation bugs, including one that was closed just before the sprint due to a participant reviewing issues in preparation. However, progress had been made on thirty-four other issues, ranging from discussing the issue, through defining a roadmap, to work in progress or proposing a patch. Two months after the sprint, another twelve issues had been closed and six more had progressed status (e.g., from roadmap to work in progress). These eighteen issues included three that were not started at the sprint, but worked on soon after as follow-up to a partial fix or due to participants reviewing the progress of sprint issues.\n\n\n\nFigure 5: Status of issues at the end of the sprint and two months after\n\n\n\nThe low-level issues included new functionality, e.g., supporting custom parallel backends; refactoring, e.g.,\nimproving the speed of scalar random number generation; improving behaviour, e.g., better formating of complex numbers, and bug fixes, e.g. managing long names when creating tarballs.\nParticipants working on documentation began by triaging all open documentation bugs on Bugzilla to identify ones that could be closed without fixing, or ones that appeared straight-forward to fix, hence the high closure rate for these issues. Some closed bugs had been open for several years.\nPackage-related issues included adding support for defining vignette order, improving messages to CRAN maintainers, and caching installed packages.\nTranslation-related issues included identifying untranslated strings in the\nR source files, and creating\na roadmap towards internationalization of help pages. The R Consortium are funding a project by participants Elio Campitelli and Renata Hirota for the first step on this roadmap.\nStatistics issues included improving the behaviour of t.test.formula() and wilcox.test.formula() for paired tests and enhancing\nsample.int() for unequal probability sampling, for which a prototype package was developed after the sprint for testing.\nAccessibility focused on two issues faced by screenreader users: logging base\ngraphics and logging R sessions. Functions resulting from this work are now\nimplemented in BrailleR.\nFinally there were two issues related to graphics, one fixed during the sprint\nimplementing 3-digit hex colors and one\nlarger project on adding alpha masks to the Quartz graphics device.\nThere were more issues prepared for the sprint than are summarised here, but\nthey were not taken up at the sprint. In some cases there was insufficient support from R Core to pursue the idea, or it was considered out of scope for the sprint, or there were no available participants with relevant skills and/or bandwidth to take the idea forward. Often participants were interested in multiple issues and were encouraged to favour issues/topics where larger group discussions were taking\nplace, to take advantage of everyone being together.\n7 Participant experience\nAs well as aiming to make progress on contributions to the R Project, the\nsprint was intended to develop participants’ knowledge and experience in\ncontribution and motivate them to continue contributing after the sprint.\nWe further looked to improve visibility and networking between\nthe R Core Team and the R community (as represented by sprint\nparticipants).\nFigure 6 summarises the activities engaged in at the sprint, for 32 out of 44 external contributors that responded to a post-sprint survey.\nAround two-thirds were involved in working on code issues and around a third worked on documentation and/or translation. Scoping work was also an important activity, in which a third of contributors engaged.\n\n\n\nFigure 6: Activities of external contributors, based on 32 responses to the participant survey.\n\n\n\nFigure 7 summarises the activities that contributors engaged in for the first time either during the sprint, or to prepare for or follow up on work done at the sprint. For around two-thirds of contributors it was the first time they had discussed a bug or issue with an R Core member, whether online or in person. About a third commented on Bugzilla for the first time and around a quarter posted their first patch. Around half the contributors built R from source for the first time, either on their own laptop or in the GitHub Codespace (or both) and for about half the contributors it was their first time working on R, C, or Rd (R documentation) files in base R.\n\n\n\nFigure 7: R core interactions and R contribution activities that external contributors engaged in for the first time, based on 32 responses to participant survey.\n\n\n\n8 Organizers and sponsors\nThe organization of the sprint was led by Heather Turner, as part of a\nresearch fellowship funded by the UK Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council. This fellowship provided core funding and was supplemented by additional sponsorship:\nPlatinum Sponsor (R Core travel): the R Foundation.\nGold sponsors (evening events, participant travel): the R Consortium; the Centre for Research in Statistical Methodology, University of Warwick, and Posit.\nSilver Sponsors (participant travel): Seminar for Statistics, ETH Zurich; Rx Studio; The Prostate Cancer Clinical Trials Consortium, and Google.\n\nThis sponsorship funded travel, accommodation and subsistence for all participants.\nMartyn Plummer and Ella Kaye completed the local organizer team. The selection committee was made up of Heather, Ella, and Gabe Becker of the RCWG.\nMembers of the RCWG helped with the planning, especially Gabe Becker who also helped gather issues in the run up to the sprint.\n9 Summary\nR Project Sprint 2023 was a very collaborative event, where external contributors had a unique opportunity to work closely with R Core members. Good progress was made across a broad range of issues with continued impact after the sprint. The feedback from both R Core and external participants was very positive, e.g.,\n\nThank you for organizing an incredible sprint and creating space for newcomers\n\n\nThere were many different parts that contributed so well to\nmake it very productive, envigourating, and motivating\n\n\nFrom arrival to departure, everything was seamless and I had a great time discovering what it takes to maintain R.\n\n\nI’m exhausted but also super excited by all the work we did and that I take as homework.\n\nSeveral participants - as well as R community members that could not attend this time - asked when we would hold a repeat event. Finding funding for ~50 people from around the world to attend a 3-day sprint is quite a challenge. So in the short term we plan to run 1-day events in collaboration with in-person conferences. Whilst this will limit the scope of tasks that can be tackled, we can benefit from people already travelling for the conference, with conference scholarship schemes helping to support inclusion.\n10 Links\nSprint website: https://contributor.r-project.org/r-project-sprint-2023/\nGitHub repository: https://github.com/r-devel/r-project-sprint-2023\n\n10.1 CRAN packages used\nBrailleR\n10.2 CRAN Task Views implied by cited packages\n\n\n",

The project has entered its twentieth year, with funding\nfor core development and infrastructure maintenance secured\nthrough 2025 (NIH NHGRI 2U24HG004059). Additional support is provided\nby NIH NCI, Chan-Zuckerberg Initiative, National Science Foundation,\nMicrosoft, and Amazon. In this news report, we give some updates on\ncore team and project activities.\nSoftware\nThe current Bioconductor release is 3.16. It is\ncompatible with R 4.2 and consists of 2183 software packages, 416\nexperiment data packages, 909 up-to-date annotation packages, 28\nworkflows, and 3 books. are\nbuilt regularly from source and therefore fully\nreproducible; an example is the\ncommunity-developed Orchestrating Single-Cell Analysis with Bioconductor.\nBioconductor in Python!\nWe’re excited to introduce BiocPy, a project aimed at enabling Bioconductor workflows in Python. Analysts today use a variety of languages in their workflows, including R/Bioconductor for statistical analysis and Python for imaging or machine learning tasks. BiocPy aims to facilitate interoperability between R and Python by providing standardized data structures based on existing Bioconductor data structures. These include genomic ranges for interval based operations, summarized experiments and other derivatives for analyzing genomic experiments. To learn more, visit the BiocPy GitHub organization.\nCore team updates\nDefault Branch Renaming\nThe default branch (that corresponds to Bioconductor devel version) will be renamed to devel on git.bioconductor.org for all packages to move forward with diversity and inclusiveness. The core has been doing extensive testing and is ready to move forward within the next 2-3 weeks.\nMaintainers will temporarily still be able to push to either devel or master to allow time for adaptation, with the goal of eventually making it an error in maybe 2-3 release cycles (1-1.5 years)\nWe will be making announcements on bioc-devel mailing list, Twitter, Mastodon, Slack, etc with an upcoming/heads up and an announcement when it is live.\nPartnering with Outreachy\nBioconductor participated as a mentoring community in Outreachy’s December 2022\n- March 2023 internship round. Outreachy provides\nopen source and open science internships to individuals impacted by systemic\nbias and underrepresentation in tech. Bioconductor received funding for two\ninterns through Outreachy’s general fund for two projects. Kirabo Atuhurira,\na software engineering student from Kampala, Uganda, was chosen to work on the\nBSgenomeForge, which attempts\nto simplify making Bsgenome data packages. Beryl Kanali, a masters student\nfrom Nairobi, Kenya, was chosen to work on\nSweave2Rmd, which attempts to\nmodernize Sweave vignettes by converting them into R Markdown. You can read more\nabout their experience at Our experience as Outreachy interns with\nBioconductor.\nBioconductor will also participate in Outreachy’s May 2023 - August 2023\ninternship round to offer internships with Bioconductor community projects.\nConferences\nThe BioC2023 and EuroBioC2023 conferences have both been announced, and abstract submissions are open. BioC Asia 2023 will be announced later this year.\nBioC2023 will be held in Boston, USA from Aug 2-4. Abstracts can be submitted until March 19.\nEuroBioC2023 will be held in Ghent, Belgium from Sep 20-22. Abstracts can be submitted until April 14.\nBlog\nThe Bioconductor blog is used for articles of interest by and for the community. Recent articles include:\nBioconductor Carpentries instructors Year 1\nAn update on the Bioconductor Carpentries global training program - applicants selected for Year 1\nIntroducing CuratedAtlasQueryR package\nCuratedAtlasQueryR is a new package that enables easy programmatic exploration of CELLxGENE single-cell human cell atlas data.\nOur experience as Outreachy interns with Bioconductor\nBioconductor participated in the Outreachy Internship program for the December 2022 cohort.

    "contents": "\nOn behalf of the editorial board, I am pleased to present Volume 14 Issue 4 of the R Journal. In response to our increased number of publications (now about 80 per year), this is the first year the R Journal moved to four issues. In addition, over the last year our software supporting the publication process has substantially improved. As a result of these developments, accepted articles are now published in a more timely fashion.\nWe have also added some R Journal reporting summaries to our webpage, and will expand on this in future.\nFor published articles, the time from first submission to accept averages at under a year.\nCurrently, just a very small number of 2021 submissions await a final decision, and even for 2022 submission, the majority of articles have received an accept/reject decision.\nThis is my last issue as Editor-in-Chief. Simon Urbanek takes over as Editor-in-Chief for 2023, having served as an Executive Editor since 2020. Simon is a huge contributor to the R community as a long-standing member of the R-core team. During his term, he plans to build further infrastructure to further streamline the R Journal submission and review process.\nDianne Cook recently finished her Editorial board term. She has been a hugely positive influence on the R Journal over the last number of years, and has been the driving force behind new software for journal operations and article production. Personally, I was very grateful for the guidance she provided as I took on the daunting role of EIC.\nDuring the last year, Gavin Simpson stepped down from his editorial board role, having served two years. Beth Atkinson and Earo Wang have completed their terms as Associate Editors. On behalf of the board, I would like to thank Gavin, Beth and Earo for their hard work on behalf of the Journal.\nNew additions are Rob Hyndman who has joined the Editorial board, and Vincent Arel-Bundock who has just joined the Associate Editor team.\nThe R Journal Editors recently held our first meeting with our Editorial Advisory Board. The purpose of the board is to assist with continuity across editors and to provide independent advice. We thank them for their time and guidance.\nBehind the scenes, several people assist with the journal operations. Mitchell O’Hara-Wild continues to work on infrastructure, H. Sherry Zhang continues to develop the rjtools package under the direction of Professor Dianne Cook. In addition, articles in this issue have been carefully copy edited by Hannah Comiskey.\nIn this issue\nNews from CRAN, Rcore, Bioconductor, RFoundation and RForwards are included in this issue.\nThis issue features 20 contributed research articles the majority of which relate to R packages\non a diverse range of topics. All packages are available on CRAN. Supplementary material with fully reproducible code is available for download from the Journal website.

This report rounds up activities of the taskforce during the second half of 2022.\nAccessibility\nLiz Hare gave a workshop on Writing Meaningful Alt-Texts for Data Visualizations in R for R-Ladies New York and contributed a chapter on the same topic to the Urban Institute’s Do No Harm Guide: Centering Accessibility in Data Visualization. Liz also participated in a Book Dash for the Turing Way, a handbook for reproducible, ethical and collaborative data science, discussing technical accessibility, e.g., bandwidth and hardware requirements, as well as disability-related issues.\ns gwynn sturdevant contributed to an article for the Justice, Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion (JEDI) Corner of Amstat News, on the topic From Visualization to ‘Sensification’, considering how senses other than sight might be used for statistical communication.\nYanina Bellini Saibene and Andrea Sánchez-Tapia contributed to a CarpentryCon 2022 panel on Translation at The Carpentries, sharing their experience of translating technical and educational materials into Spanish. The panel was part of a wider effort by The Carpentries to make their materials available in languages other than English, which will help more people to teach or learn data science skills, including R programming.\nCommunity engagement\nRainbowR continued to build on its relaunch, led by Ella Kaye and Zane Dax. Inspired by a post on the RainbowR Twitter, community member Laura Bakala developed the gglgbtq package, which provides ggplot2 palettes and themes based on various pride flags. Zane led the development of the tidyrainbow GitHub repository that collates several datasets pertaining to the LGBTQ+ community, where LGBTQ+ folk are explicitly represented and where it is not assumed that gender is binary. These data sets provide great opportunities for data analysis and visualisation in R and other languages.\nRainbowR are meeting bimonthly online, giving people an opportunity to present, in an informal and safe space, anything R related they had been working on. Ella recently set up a Mastodon account @rainbowr@tech.lgbt, which has helped to grow the community, with several new folk joining the RainbowR Slack as a result.\nConferences\nYanina Bellini Saibene was co-chair of the LatinR 2022 conference. Now in its 5th year, 900 people attended the online conference, with keynotes, regular talks and tutorials in each of the conference languages: English, Spanish and Portuguese. A charge was introduced for tutorials reducing no-shows and enabling tutors to be paid, but scholarships were offered thanks to donations. Yanina was a keynote speaker at CarpentryCon 2022, where she spoke about Achieving the change we want one conference at a time (in Spanish). In the talk she shared actions that can be taken to make events more diverse and inclusive, based on 20 years of experience organizing face-to-face, virtual and hybrid events. Many of these actions are summarized in the article “Ten simple rules to host an inclusive conference” (Joo et al. 2022), which distils learnings from organizing useR! 2021.\nTeaching\nPaola Corrales and Yanina Bellini Saibene gave a tutorial From spreadsheets to R at the Software Sustainability Institute’s Research Software Camp: Next Steps in Coding. The tutorial was presented in Spanish - one of two events during the research camp in a language other than English.\nFor anyone wanting to teach package development, we would like to highlight the Forwards materials which are organized into four 1-hour hands-on modules: Packages in a Nutshell, Setting up your system, Your first package, and Package documentation. The material is released under a CC BY-NC-SA license.\nR Contribution\nSaranjeet Kaur Bhogal continued work on the R Development Guide, as part of the R project’s Google Summer of Docs project, alongside the second technical writer, Lluís Revilla. The case study summarises the progress made during the official project period. There is some funding remaining from the grant, so there are plans to continue work in 2023.\nMichael Chirico and others supported R Contribution Working Group (RCWG) initiatives to encourage more people to contribute translations to base R. RCWG member Gergely Daróczi set up a Weblate server to provide a user-friendly web interface for adding/editing translations. This was used during the R translatón/Hackaton de tradução do R that was organized by RCWG/LatinR as a satellite to LatinR 2022, led by Beatriz Milz, Ángela Sanzo, Macarena Quiroga, and Caio Lente. Use of the Weblate server has gradually increased and Michael Lawrence made a recent commit to R-devel, which bundled over 3000 translations from the platform across 8 languages and 17 translators.\nHeather Turner and Ella Kaye joined RCWG members Elin Waring and Gabriel Becker in running monthly Office Hours for R contributors. These sessions provide an opportunity to discuss how to get started contributing to R and to look at open bugs or work on translations together. This has led to some bugs being closed such as Bug 16158: Error in predict.lm for rank-deficient cases and Bug 17853: stats::factanal print method drops labels when sort=TRUE. The Office Hours are held at two times on the same day to cater for different time zones, see the R Contributors Events page or Meetup for upcoming events.\nWe also started planning for the R Project Developer Sprint 2023, to be hosted at the University of Warwick, Coventry, UK, from August 30 to September 1. This sprint will bring together novice and experienced contributors, to work alongside members of the R Core Team on contributions to base R. Thanks to the event sponsors, full board on-campus accommodation will be provided during the sprint and funding is available for travel if required. Anyone interested to attend is encouraged to self-nominate via the application form by Friday 10 March. Additional sponsors are also welcome.\nSocial Media\nRCWG and Forwards have also set up Mastodon accounts, follow them at @R_Contributors@hachyderm.io and @R_Forwards@hachyderm.io, respectively.\nChanges in Membership\nNew members\nWe welcome the following members to the taskforce:\nOn-ramps team: Allison Vuong\nSurveys team: Daniela Cialfi\n\n\n\nR.

    "contents": "\n1 R-devel selected changes\nR 4.3.0 is due to be released around April 2023. The following gives a\nselection of the most important changes in R-devel, which are likely to\nappear in the new release.\nDates and times\nThere are a number of (robustness) improvements in the handling of dates\nand times. These include warnings about extrapolation for datetimes before\n1902/1900, finer control for padding when printing years, improved detection\nof offset with strftime() (%z), inclusion of system time zone and\ninformation on timezone support implementation in sessionInfo(), more\nrobust handling of hand-crafted POSIXlt objects, optional support for\nusing system timezone support on recent macOS, improved detection of the\nsystem time zone on Windows and improved default tick locations and default\nformats in axis.Date() and axis.POSIXct().\nEncoding support\nPerformance of regular expression operations in R has been improved by\nreducing the costs of encoding conversions. With perl=FALSE, all\ninputs have to be converted to UTF-16 or UTF-32, and the conversion is\nnow faster. With perl=TRUE, performance has been improved by opting\nout from duplicate checks for UTF-8 validity in PCRE2. With\nfixed=TRUE, performance has been improved by taking advantage of the\nproperties of UTF-8. One of the motivations for the speedups was to\nreduce the incentive for using useBytes=TRUE with regular expression\noperations, which often leads to incorrect results or errors due to\nproducing invalid strings.\nSee Speedups in operations with regular expressions\nfor more information.\nThe support for encoding-agnostic string operations in R using the\n“bytes” encoding has been improved. It is now possible to read a text\nfile directly as bytes. Regexp operations, when creating new strings by\nsplitting or substituting, now also flag them as “bytes” when any of the\ninput has been flagged as such. This simplifies encoding-agnostic parsing\nof files such as DESCRIPTION. iconv(,from=\"\") now respects the\nencoding flag of the input string, making it easier to recover from\ntype-instability in return values of regular expression operations.\nImproving the support for encoding-agnostic operations using the “bytes”\nencoding comes together with stricter checking of validity of real\nstrings in a character encoding, e.g. “unknown/native”, which has been\nhelpful in revealing user errors. In the long term, it should also help\nto simplify encoding support in R.\nSee Improvements in handling bytes encoding\nfor more information. The blog includes a detailed introduction to string and\nencoding support in R.\nSee Why to avoid \\x in regular expressions\nfor related information on the danger of using \\x escapes in regular\nexpressions, which leads to errors, that are now more likely to be\ndetected by R. This is closely related as \\x is a common way to\ncreate invalid strings.\nGraphics\nThe grDevices and grid packages have new functions for rendering typeset\nglyphs, primarily: grDevices::glyphInfo() and grid::grid.glyph().\nThe behaviour of compositing operators in grid::grid.group() has been\ntweaked to allow consistency across graphics devices.\nThe grDevices::quartz() device will support gradient fills, pattern\nfills, clipping paths, masks, compositing operators, affine\ntransformations, stroked/filled paths, and glyphs. To be soon merged to\nR-devel.\nAccessibility on Windows\nRgui console on Windows now works better with the open-source NVDA\nscreen reader when the “full” blinking cursor is selected. This is due to\nimproved implementation of the console cursor (when it is displayed and\nhidden with respect to application startup and window focus) on which\nmakes it easier for the screen reader to detect where the cursor is.\nPreviously, NVDA was not able to read out the character under the cursor\nmoved by the arrow keys.\nThe drop-field GraphApp control, which is used in the Rgui configuration\neditor, has been extended so that it can be left by pressing the TAB key,\nso without using the mouse.\nGraphApp has been extended to allow reverse-order navigation through the\ncontrols using Shift+TAB key, which can now be done also in the Rgui\nconfiguration editor.\nOther selected changes\nUsing vectors of more than one element with the logical operators &&\nand || will give an error in R 4.3.0 (a warning in R 4.2.x, a check\nerror since R 3.6.0).\nSupport for working with concordances has been extended from\nSweave to help files. A concordance is a mapping between lines in an\nintermediate file (e.g., .tex or .html) and lines in the\ncorresponding input file (e.g., .Rnw or .Rd), which, for example, allows\nrelating problems in the intermediate file to the source file from which\nit was generated.\nSee Concordances for more\ninformation.\nThe implementation of the sampling profiler, Rprof(), has been\nimproved. On macOS, the profiler is now more robust against high load on\nthe system by using low-level Mach API to avoid a race condition between\ninitialization of pthread data and arrival of a profiler signal. This\nrace condition could lead to a live-lock when the system has been\noverloaded due to a too short profiling interval. As an additional\nmeasure, Rprof() now refuses to use a too short profiling interval,\nwhich in the first place would lead to incorrect profiling results. To\nprevent a deadlock seen on Windows, the profiler has been rewritten to\navoid using C runtime functions while the main thread is suspended.\nPackage installation now uses C++17 as the default C++ standard (and\nthere is initial support for C++23). Also, there now is support for\na package to indicate the version of the C standard which should be\nused to compile it, and for the installing user to specify this. In\nmost cases, C17 (a “bug-fix” of C11) is used by default.\nProducing PDF manuals (R CMD Rd2pdf) now loads standard AMS-LaTeX\npackages for greater coverage of math commands in Rd equations\n(e.g., \\lVert and \\text), and for consistency with the\nenhanced HTML math rendering introduced in R 4.2.0. This change has been\nbackported to the R 4.2 release branch.\nThe \"repos\" option is now initialized from the repositories file,\nsee ?R_REPOSITORIES, allowing the default CRAN mirror to be set therein.\n2 Bug statistics for 2022\nSummaries of bug-related activities over the past year were derived from the\ndatabase underlying R’s Bugzilla system.\nOverall, 180 new bugs or requests for enhancements were reported,\n171 reports were closed, and 869 comments (on any report) were added\nby a total of 123 contributors.\nThis amounts to one report/closure every other day,\nand 2–3 comments per day.\nThe numbers of reports, closures and comments are about 20% lower than in\n2021, \nwhereas the number of contributors stayed the same.\nHigh bug activity in 2021 had largely been driven by dedicated efforts of\nseveral contributors in reviewing old reports.\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Bug tracking activity by month in 2022\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Bug tracking activity by weekday in 2022\n\n\n\nFigures 1 and 2 show statistics for the numbers of new reports,\nclosures and comments by calendar month and weekday, respectively, in 2022.\nThe frequency of new reports was relatively stable over the year with minor\npeaks in January and June. There tended to be more new reports than\nclosures, except for July and especially March with a revived effort\nto deal with old reports, including 9 related to the nlme package,\nwhich is also maintained by the R Core Team.\nThe top 5 components reporters have chosen for their reports were\n“Misc”, “Language”, “Low-level”, “Documentation”, and “Wishlist”,\nwhich is the same set as in 2021. Many reports are suggestions for\nenhancements and placed either in the “Wishlist” or in a\nspecific component but with severity level set to “enhancement”.\nBug discussions led to an average of 72 comments per month, with a minimum\nof 42 in August and a maximum of 111 in January.\nFrom the numbers in Figure 2 we see that the R community is also active during\nweekends, though at a lower frequency.\nAcknowledgements\nTomas Kalibera’s work on the article and R development has received funding\nfrom the National Science Foundation award 1925644.\n\nCRAN packages used\nnlme\nCRAN Task Views implied by cited packages\nChemPhys, Econometrics, Environmetrics, Finance, MixedModels, OfficialStatistics, Psychometrics, Spatial, SpatioTemporal\n\n\n",

Mark van der Loo has very kindly agreed to move from Associate Editor to Executive Editor to fill a temporary gap. One new Associate Editor, Kevin Burke, has recently joined the team.\nBehind the scenes, several people are assisting with the journal operations and the new developments. Mitchell O’Hara-Wild continues to work on infrastructure, and H. Sherry Zhang continues to develop the rjtools package. In addition, articles in this issue have been carefully copy edited by Hannah Comiskey.\nThere are also exciting new efforts in developing software to convert the legacy papers from latex to Rmarkdown, and hence create an html version to complement the pdf. Abhishek Ulayil, funded by the 2022 Google Summer of Code project, supervised by Heather Turner and Di Cook, with collaboration from Christophe Dervieux and Mitch O’Hara-Wild, has created the R package, texor, https://abhi-1u.github.io/texor/. It converts the legacy latex style into to the new Rmarkdown template, as would be given with the rjtools package. This package will be used to slowly, and steadily convert as many past articles into an html version.\nIf you are currently only a latex author, the texor package will get your paper into an Rmarkdown paper, doing the hard-work of the conversion. This is a good opportunity to get a head start on learning how to make reproducible documents. Reproducible documents keeps your code and results in the same place, and reduces the chance of getting them out of sync. Going forwards with the R Journal there will be a growing emphasis on receiving papers in Rmarkdown (and Quarto, at some point) format, because it is easier to test the code, and it makes the work more accessible to readers.\n1 In this issue\nNews from the CRAN, the R Foundation and the Forwards Taskforce are included in this issue.

This report rounds up activities of the taskforce during the first half of 2022.\nAccessibility\nAs another step towards improving the accessibility of the R Journal, Di Cook and Heather Turner are mentoring a Google Summer of Code student, Abhishek Ulayil, on the project Converting past R Journal articles to HTML. This project has benefited from regular input from Mitchell O’Hara Wild and Christophe Dervieux, authors of the rjtools package that provides the new HTML template for R Journal articles (O’Hara-Wild et al. 2022).\ns gwynn sturdevant and Jonathan Godfrey were part of an invited panel at JSM 2022 on Delivering Data Differently that explored alternatives to data visualisation.\nCommunity engagement\nThe community team have taken a number of actions to support the R community in Africa. A WhatsApp group has been set up for leaders of African R User Groups, to facilitate collaboration. Kevin O’Brien has been a Zoom host for several R User Groups, including the Botswana, Eswatini and Bulawayo groups. Zane Dax worked with the Accra R User Group on graphical design for advertising their meetups. Kevin O’Brien and Sam Toet helped to organize the first Francophone satRday, which featured a line up of African speakers.\nAnother focus has been the relaunch of RainbowR led by Ella Kaye and Zane Dax. Following a well-attended online meetup, the website was rebuilt, the Slack group opened to new members with a new code of conduct, and the Twitter account has been in active use. The group plan to have regular online meetups and to raise awareness of issues affecting the LGBTQ+ community through sharing relevant data sets for exploration and teaching.\nBeyond this, taskforce members continue to engage with a range of communities. Zane Dax contributed to an update of the Minorities in R (MiR) website. Yanina Bellini Saibene and Heather Turner joined the Building inclusive communities panel at the launch of the AsiaR community, to share their experience from working with different communities.\nConferences\nYanina Bellini Saibene assisted the useR! 2022 team on behalf of the R Foundation, to share expertise in the organization of virtual conferences and help incorporate good practices that encourage diverse participation. (The conference was originally planned to be hybrid, but moved to be completely online.) Such practices included adding representatives from different regions to the organizing team, securing funding to caption talks, accepting elevator pitches and tutorials in non-English languages, and adjusting the registration fees to the income group of each participant’s country of residence. Many of these practices were based on the work of the organizing team of useR! 2021 - that included Yanina and other Forwards members - who summarized their recommendations in the recent publication: “Ten simple rules to host an inclusive conference” (Joo et al. 2022).\nR Contribution\nSaranjeet Kaur Bhogal and Heather Turner organized a series of Collaboration Campfires with a goal to demystify the R development process and highlight ways that R programmers can contribute. The first two sessions explored R’s bug-tracking process and how R users can contribute to reviewing bugs. The second two sessions explored R’s process for localization and how to contribute to a translation team. The sessions attracted a diverse group of participants who engaged with the interactive activities, providing a foundation for further engagement.\nThe R Contribution working Group (RCWG) organized a Bug BBQ as a satellite to useR! 2022. Members of the RCWG prepared a number of open bugs in advance, for participants to look at in one or more of three organized online sessions. The event was supported by several R Core members and attended by both novice and experienced contributors. For experienced contributors the event provided a spur to work on open bugs, leading to progress on several issues. Meanwhile novice contributors contributed to the analysis of open bugs, under the guidance of experienced contributors. As the first event of its kind, the event showed promise as a way to engage the wider R community in contribution.\nSaranjeet Kaur Bhogal has been working on a new chapter for the R Development Guide on contributing translations, as part of the R project’s Google Summer of Docs project, with substantial contribution from Michael Chirico. Along with Ben Ubah, Michael is co-mentoring a Google Summer of Code student, Meet Bhatnagar, to create a dashboard to monitor the status of translations in R.\nChanges in Membership\nNew members\nWe welcome the following member to the taskforce:\nCommunity team: Ella Kaye (co-leader)\nPrevious members\nThe following members have stepped down:\nCommunity team: Richard Ngamita (co-leader)\nAccessibility team: Becca Wilson\nSurveys team: Anna Vasylytsya (co-leader)\nWe thank them for their contribution to the taskforce.\n\n\n\nR.

    "contents": "\n1 Motivation\nThe Why R? Turkey 2022 conference was a three-day online conference that was organized as a part of the Why R? Global conference series have been organized annually by the Why R? Foundation since 2017. It is known as one of the largest annual R conferences in Europe (Burdukiewicz et al. 2018, 2019). In addition to the main conference, pre-meetings are held in different cities from all over the world. One of these pre-meetings was organized with the invited speakers in Turkey in 2020. This online event was the first R conference in Turkey. In addition, as a result of the positive feedback received from the participants, the theme of the Why R? Turkey 2021 conference was determined immediately. Thereafter, the second R conference was organized in 2021 with invited speakers (Cavus et al. 2021). The main objective was to bring Turkish R users together from all over the world, the second conference attracted a lot of attention with over 2000 registered participants.\n\n\n\nFigure 1: The logo of Why R? Turkey 2022 Conference\n\n\n\nThe main limitation of the conference in 2021 was that it consisted of invited speakers only. Upon the feedback from the participants, the conference structure was changed into having regular talks, lightning talks. In addition, the conference also had a practical side with workshops for both beginners and more experienced R users. In this way, the conference turned into a more participant-friendly format. The following subsections are summarizing the planning phase and the content of the events.\n2 Planning\nAfter comparing several alternatives, it was decided to continue with Zoom (zoom.us) with one main account and six admins as the main platform for all events.\nA mailing tool called MailChimp, which also has on admin account, was used to establish seamless communication with the scientific committee and all other participants in the organization.\nParticipation certificates for attendees, speakers, workshop tutors and panelists were prepared and delivered by using the Sertifier platform (sertifier.com/tr/) at the end of the conference.\nNumerous academic publishing houses were investigated for publishing proceeding book with E-ISBN and it was decided to work with Nobel Publication House. The electronic version of the proceeding book was provided by the international publishing house.\nWorkshops\nFive workshops (\\(\\sim 1.5\\) hour-long sessions), from beginner level to advanced level were organized. Three of the workshops were held in Turkish and two in English. Thus, it was ensured that participants from all over the world would benefit from them. Detailed contents provided by the tutors for the workshops. Each each workshop was recorded with the consent of the tutor and after the conference videos were published on Youtube. Details and Youtube links for each workshop can be found below.\nIntroduction to R Programming by Ahmet Uraz Akgül (Turkish):\nR programming language is increasing its popularity day by day, including our country, and it has found use in almost every discipline. Being a free software, it has started to reach more people with its access to open source codes and the opportunities it offers. In such an environment, knowing the R programming language provides serious advantages. In the competitive software world, R can survive as a language worth learning; it may even be the language we use most often.\nData Visualization with R by İnan Utku Türkmen and Cansu Hürses (Turkish):\nAs part of the data visualization workshop with R, we will cover basic visualization issues with the ggplot2 (Wickham 2016) package, which is one of the most popular data visualization tools in the field of data science. Using this package we will practice how to create basic static chart types. We will see with examples how a chart can be customized by adding a title, specifying axis names, coloring according to certain categories, marking a specific region on the chart, and taking a section. During the workshop, we will create the interactive graphic in the link below, which is one of the famous visualizations of the Gapminder foundation, using R packages step by step: https://www.gapminder.org/tag/map/.\nProcessing tabular data with tidyverse by İmran Kocabıyık (Turkish):\nMost of the data we use in practice are kept in tabular format. The purpose of use of these data, which are stored in databases and various types of files, may not always be analysis. For this reason, even if the data is kept in tabular form, it requires serious processing to model or analyze it. The dplyr (Wickham et al. 2022) and tidyr (Wickham and Girlich 2022) packages offer very simple and effective solutions for these processes.\nIntroduction to Bioconductor by Nitesh Turaga (English):\nThis talk is an overview of the Bioconductor project which develops, supports, and disseminates free open source software, in the R programming language, that facilitates rigorous and reproducible analysis of data from current and emerging biological assays. The Bioconductor project has a large footprint around the world both in industry and academic research. We’ll discuss the important aspects of project such as methods of contribution, programming paradigms - interoperability and data structure design, and differences to other projects to draw comparison. It will also include a brief introduction to essential genomics data structures that have been pillars to the Bioconductor ecosystem. We welcome participation as we are dedicated to building a diverse, collaborative, and welcoming community of developers and data scientists.\nDeep Learning using R by Krystian Zielinski (English):\nDeep Learning is certainly not a future of technologies that surround us on a daily basis. It’s too late – it’s already here. Just try to find a company that’s not willing to enhance its products with AI driven algorithms. The data is there already, and the trust barrier is shrinking. It’s to nobody’s surprise – if AI is used in very sensitive areas like banking, military or medicine, it can’t be that bad. Netflix’s recommendation algorithms, Google Lens, Self Driving cars – you name it, Deep Learning is used everywhere. Thanks to many popular frameworks, training Neural Network model has never been so easy. You can find tutorials online, and based on them solve many problems. But after some time, the question arises: „How does this even work?” – and you should really know the answer. In the workshops I’d like to show you how theory affects the practice. Based on many examples we will train DNN models, show its limits, check how parameters like e.g. activation function affect the training phase, suggest best practices in data preparation and DNN architecture, explain the model’s predictions. If you’re familiar with R – this workshop is suited for you! If you’re just starting with Deep Learning or already have some experience, come and join us - I bet you won’t regret it!\nShort Tutorials\nIn addition to the workshops, short tutorials on three topics were organized. This type of event was planned to focus on more specific topics in longer duration than a regular talk. (\\(\\sim 30\\) mins each) Each workshop was recorded with the consent of the tutor and after the conference videos were published on Youtube. Details and Youtube links for each workshop can be found below.\nSpatial Analysis with R by Fırat Gündem (Turkish):\nOpen Data Portal applications of local governments both in America and Europe added a serious spatial dimension to data. The spatial dimension in question covers a wide area, from storing data in a way that includes spatial information (shape file, GeoJSON, etc.) to spatial data visualizations and analysis with spatial statistics and spatial econometric methods. The R program is constantly being renewed and expanded to include all spatial analysis techniques in the literature. Although there are many people who do spatial analysis with package programs such as ArcGIS, which are expensive and require personal licenses, RStudio allows to perform all spatial analyzes easily and free of charge with the libraries it contains. In this short study, all the basic steps of spatial analysis will be performed using a set of R libraries. For this, real spatial data from Turkey (GDP per capita on a provincial basis, etc.) will be used. Then, spatial data projection (sf, sp), neighborhood matrix creation and manipulation (rgdal), spatial data visualization and static and dynamic mapping ggplot2 (Wickham 2016), tmap (Tennekes 2018), leaflet (Cheng et al. 2021), three-dimensional mapping rayshader (Morgan-Wall 2021), spatial statistics rgeoda (Li and Anselin 2022) in RStudio. and spatial econometric models will be introduced practically using the relevant R libraries. Thus, all necessary tools for spatial data science will be introduced in R and the use of R will be encouraged with user-friendly applications.\nThe R Application for Physics-Informed Neural Networks by Melih Ağraz (Turkish):\nPhysics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) is a deep learning framework designed to solve nonlinear differential equations using artificial neural networks, published in 2019. Simple deep feed-forward neural network architectures and automatic differentiation method are used to solve differential equations in PINNs method. The PINNs method was first developed with Python Tensorflow. In this study, we will show how the solution of the equation \\(y'-y=0\\) for \\(y(0)=1\\), \\(y(1)=e\\) is solved by using reticulate (Ushey et al. 2021) library in R, with the help of PINNs method. This study is thought to find application area of PINNs method for R users as well. For this reason, a simple differential equation solution example such as \\(y' - y = 0\\) is preferred.\nServerless R in the Cloud - Deploying R into Production with AWS and Docker by İsmail Tigrek (English):\nThis tutorial will walk through deploying R code, machine learning models, or Shiny applications in the cloud environment. With this knowledge, you will be able to take any local R-based project you’ve built on your machine or at your company and deploy it into production on AWS using modern serverless and microservices architectures. In order to do this, you will learn how to properly containerize R code using Docker, allowing you to create reproducible environments. You will also learn how to set up event-based and time-based triggers. We will build out a real example that reads in live data, processes it, and writes it into a data lake, all in the cloud.\nPanels\nThe panels were planned based on the sharing experience in an interactive environment, where the participants could come together with experts in different domains. Biostatistics and R Education were selected as major topics in these events. The links to the video recordings and detailed content of the panels are given below:\nBiostatistics and Applications in R moderated by Prof. Dr. Ergun Karaağaoğlu (Turkish):\nProf. Dr. Recai Yücel (Temple University), Prof. Dr. Mithat Gönen (Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center), and Dr. Anıl Dolgun (CSL Limited) attended as the panelists. In this panel, current research studies on biostatistics and the importance of using R in this domain were discussed. In addition, information about how career development was positively affected by using R was shared by the panelists with the audience. Thus, it was ensured that the participants were informed about the importance of the R in this field.\nR Education moderated by Olgun Aydin (Turkish):\nThe main topic of the panel was how to teach R in academia. Prof. Dr. Mine Çetinkaya-Rundel (Duke University), Dr. Mine Doğucu (University of California), and Assoc. Prof. Dr. Kübra Kabasakal (Hacettepe University) attended as the panelists. The panelists shared their approach in terms of teaching R in different fields of academic stuides. Moreoever, the panelists shared examples from their teaching materials with the audience.\n3 Participants\nThe \\(1366\\) participants were registered for the conference: \\(70\\%\\) of the participants were students and the rest were professionals who work for governmental institutions, companies from the private sector, and as academicians. The \\(43\\%\\) of the students are undergraduates, \\(26\\%\\) of them master studies and the \\(31\\%\\) are Ph.D. students.\n\n\n\nFigure 2: The percentage of the degree of the participant students by years\n\n\n\nWhen the channels that the participants heard about the conference are examined, surprisingly, the percentage of participants who registered for the conference “on recommendation” was quite high (\\(26\\%\\)), in addition to the social media channels (LinkedIn - \\(30\\%\\), Twitter - \\(26\\%\\), and Instagram - \\(12\\%\\)) of which usage has increased in recent years.\n\n\n\nFigure 3: How did the participants hear about the conference?\n\n\n\nIn the registration form, questions about participants’ level of R knowledge and motivation of participants’ to take part in Why R? Turkey 2022 were included to deeply analyze profile of the participants. The \\(69\\%\\) of the participants stated that they had taken or attended a course related to R before. They evaluated their R programming language usage levels as shown in Table 1.\n\n\n\nIt can be seen from Table 1 that \\(90\\%\\) of them did not attend a conference about R before. In this respect, the conference was held with an audience suitable for the purpose of expanding usage of R. The areas of their interest are Data Visualization, Statistical Modeling, Big Data, Data Mining, Machine Learning, and Deep Learning, respectively. The events planned for Why R? Turkey 2022 that motivated them register the conference are respectively: Scientific Sessions (\\(40\\%\\)), Workshops (\\(35\\%\\)) and Panels (\\(26\\%\\)).\n4 Evaluation\nAn evaluation questionnaire was conducted after the event to measure the satisfaction with the conference and to collect suggestions future organizations (Cordoba et al. 2019). The satisfaction part of the questionnaire consists of two questions: (1) general satisfaction and (2) the interaction level between the presenters and the listeners. The results of the questionnaire are quite positive in terms of the answer of the respondents. On a scale of \\(0-5\\), the mean of the satisfaction score is \\(4.74\\) with \\(0.46\\) standard deviation. Besides that, the mean of the interaction score is \\(4.50\\) with \\(0.69\\) standard deviation.\nThe second part of the questionnaire consists of the questions related to the motivation of the respondents regarding attendance and being a presenter for the next edition of the conference. According to the responses, although nearly all of the respondents (\\(99\\%\\)) plan to attend the conference in the next years, \\(30\\%\\) aim to participate to as a presenter.\nThe last part of the questionnaire is about the suggestions from the respondents. The suggestions generally focus on increasing the duration of regular talks and workshops. In addition, among the speakers, the higher number of private sector employees and the mention of sector or freelance job opportunities were among the most prominent suggestions. Respondents strongly mentioned that next events, which has been held online for two years, should be held face-to-face in the coming years to increase its effectiveness.\n5 Summary\nWhy R? Turkey 2022, as the next edition of Why R? Turkey 2021 conference, was the first R conference with call for papers held in Turkey. This conference aimed to encourage researchers and professionals, who are R users and developers, to share their work with a wider audience. This conference was organized as a user-friendly conference, taking into account the feedback received in the previous year’s version. In addition to scientific sessions, workshops, short tutorials, and panels were organized to broaden the content of the event. According to the evaluation survey made right after the conference, the participants stated that they were very satisfied and they would like to participate as a presenter to Why R conferences in the upcoming years. This finding demonstrates that the organisers of the conference succeeded the goals.\n6 Organizers\nThe Organizing Committee of Why R? Turkey 2022 consisted of eight Turkish researchers from three different countries: Turkey, Poland, and United Kingdom. It consisted of Mustafa Cavus (Warsaw University of Technology, Eskisehir Technical University), Olgun Aydin (Gdansk University of Technology, Why R? Foundation), Filiz Karadag (Ege University), Ugur Dar (Eskisehir Technical University), Ozan Evkaya (University of Edinburgh), Derya Turfan (Hacettepe University), Ozancan Ozdemir, Deniz Bezer (Middle East Technical University).\n7 Acknowledgement\nAs an organization committee, we would like to thank for his suggestions and support during the preparation part of the conference, for designing our graphics, and , for their guidance in general and also organizing the some of the panels and workshops. Moreover, we would like to thank the sponsors that support the Why R?

    "contents": "\nOn behalf of the editorial board, I am pleased to present Volume 14 Issue 1 of the R Journal. This\nissue heralds a switch from two issues per year to four and is my first as Editor-in-Chief. The change to four issues per year is in response to the increase in published articles in recent years. As articles will appear more speedily\nin a published issue, we will no longer list pdfs for Accepted articles on The R Journal website.\nFirst, some news about the journal board. Dianne Cook has stepped down as Editor-in-Chief but continues as an Executive Editor. In her time as EIC she provided excellent leadership and brought in many advances, most notably the change to the new modern journal format. One new Associate Editor, Simone Blomberg, has recently joined the team. We have a new, slimmed-down Editorial advisory board consisting of Henrik Bengtssen, Gabriela de Quiroz, Michael Kane and Rececca Killick. The board will provide continuity across changes in the editorial board, offering advice and acting as an independent body to handle issues of academic integrity.\nBehind the scenes, several people are assisting with the journal operations and the new developments. Mitchell O’Hara-Wild continues to work on infrastructure, and H. Sherry Zhang continues to develop the rjtools package. In addition, articles in this issue have been carefully copy edited by Hannah Comiskey.\n1 In this issue\nNews from the CRAN and the R Foundation are included in this issue.\nThis issue features 22 contributed research articles the majority of which relate to R packages\nfor modelling tasks. All packages are available on CRAN.

    "contents": "\nForwards is an R Foundation taskforce working to widen the participation of under-represented groups in the R project and in related activities, such as the useR! conference. This report rounds up activities of the taskforce during the second half of 2022.\nAccessibility\nSince a number of people have joined the taskforce with a particular interest in accessibility, we have established a new Accessibility Team, led by s gwynn sturdevant and Jonathan Godfrey. The team will address accessibility to R and the R ecosystem in a broad sense, considering barriers faced by people with disabilities, or working in situations with limited internet access, or working in a language other than English, to name some of the major issues.\nAt their inaugural meeting in November, the team focused on improving documentation and reference materials for screen-reader users and those who prefer reading electronic documents in dark mode. Both issues are best handled by creating documents in HTML format. Di Cook shared a development version of The R Journal’s new HTML format, which was welcomed enthusiastically by the group and there was agreement to work together on testing and improving the journal’s accessibility.\nThe work of the new team is a continuation of the work Forwards has done on accessibility in the past, primarily in the context of the useR! conference. For 2021, Forwards members supported the organizers in their efforts to ensure that presentation materials and conference tools were accessible. Further detail is given in the blog posts Making Accessible Presentations at useR! 2021: The Story Behind the Scenes and How to Improve Conference Accessibility for Screen-reader Users - An Interview with Liz Hare. Liz Hare has been working on a joint project with Silvia Canelón as part of the MiR community, promoting good accessibility practices in data visualisation, a project that received funding from Code for Science and Society.\nCommunity engagement\nThe community team had a reboot in November, with Richard Ngamita stepping up to join Kevin O’Brien as co-lead. The team plans to focus on fostering networks in regions where the R community is less well connected, in particular supporting the work of AfricaR and the new AsiaR community, which has established a Slack Workspace and plans to hold regional online meetups in 2022.\nA key form of support is to encourage knowledge-sharing between regions, for example, by nominating speakers from Africa or Asia for speaking opportunities, or by joining events as a guest speaker. In recent months, Forwards members Mine Çetinkaya-Rundel spoke at satRday Nairobi, Heather Turner spoke at the 1st anniversary of R-Ladies Nairobi, and Kevin O’Brien spoke at the 3rd anniversary of Accra R User Ghana.\nSeveral members of the Community team are part of the R-Consortium Diversity & Inclusion Working Group, led by Samantha Toet. This group is currently working on four big projects: a guide to writing a code of conduct; an event organizer checklist; a speaker directory, and a speaker nomination form for R Consortium-affiliated events.\nConferences Team\nThe conferences team also gained a new lead, Yanina Bellini Saibene, who has been involved in the organization of many R events and conferences. Along with Natalia da Silva and Riva Quiroga, she chaired the LatinR 2021 conference, which took place online in November. Being online helped them to reach a record 1000 registrants. Highlights of the program included several papers from Spain, a full panel in Portuguese, and a full panel of Latin American women package developers. This is a great advance from the initial R Foundation endorsed event in 2018, which was a satellite to the 47 JAIIO informatics conference, attended by 50 people.\nIn collaboration with Claudia Alejandra Huaylla from the Surveys team, Yanina Bellini Saibene reflected in a blog post on the Latin American Community at useR! 2021, describing an exceptional increase in participation compared to previous years. They identify many practices that facilitated this growth, starting with including Latin American R users in the organizing team.\nSeveral members of Forwards have been involved in the Google Season of Docs project to develop a knowledgebase and information board to support the organization of useR! conferences. In particular, Andrea Sánchez-Tapia (co-lead of the Surveys team) and Noa Tamir (co-lead of the Conferences team) were hired as writers on the project and they made sure that diversity and inclusion were considered throughout the documentation. The project built on a lot of previous work by Forwards, including the annual surveys conducted at useR! and pieces of documentation written by the Conferences team as part of their work to make useR! more inclusive. Forwards will continue to be involved in maintaining these resources, which have already gained attention from the organizers of other R conferences.\nOn-ramps Team\nThe Forwards first-contributions repository walks people through making a simple pull request on GitHub, a useful skill for contributing to R packages and other open source software. Zane Dax updated the README with instructions in Spanish in time for Hacktoberfest 2021, which encourages people to make four quality pull requests to public GitHub and/or GitLab repositories during October.\nThe R Contribution Working Group held an Ideas Incubator over the summer to generate new ideas to work on during 2021/2022. One issue prioritised for attention was improving communications. This led to further development of the R Contribution Site, which is now hosted at https://contributor.r-project.org/ and linked from the main R Project website. The group has also set up the @R_Contributors Twitter account, for sharing event announcements and other news. The current focus is to run some outreach events related to the R Development Guide. Saranjeet Kaur Bhogal and Heather Turner are leading this project, which is supported by a grant from Code for Science and Society, as part of the Digital Infrastructure Incubator. The idea is that these events will provide an on-ramp into a larger contributor event to run in parallel with useR! 2022.\nPackage Development Modules\nMine Çetinkaya-Rundel and Emma Rand ran a “train-the-trainer” event in November/December aimed at R-Ladies leaders and others who wanted to use the Forwards package development teaching materials with their user groups. Attendees are starting to plan workshops based on the materials: a course was run in early January 2022 by R-Ladies NYC (lead by Joyce Robbins, assisted by Erin Grand and Emily Dodwell) and a course is currently underway by R-Ladies Remote (lead by Heather Turner and Rita Giordano).\nChanges in Membership\nNew members\nWe welcome the following members to the taskforce:\nConferences team: Yanina Bellini Saibene (co-leader)\nSurveys team: Andrea Sánchez-Tapia (co-leader)\nPrevious members\nThe following members have stepped down:\nCommunity team: Madlene Hamilton, Ileena Mitra\nOn-ramps team: Jenny Bryan (co-leader)\nSocial media team: Lorna Maria Aine (co-leader), Shakirah Nakalungi (co-leader), Wenfeng Qin\nSurveys team: David Meza\nTeaching team: Yizhe Xu\nWe thank them for their contribution to the taskforce. We also acknowledge the work of Emily Dodwell, who has stepped down as administrator after serving for several years (remaining a member of the Teaching team) – s gwynn sturdevant has taken on this role.\n\n\n\n",

    "contents": "\nOn behalf of the editorial board, I am pleased to present Volume 13 Issue 1 of the R Journal.\nFirst, some news about the journal board. Welcome to Gavin Simpson, who joins as a new Executive Editor! In addition, welcome to our new Associate Editors Nicholas Tierney, Isabella Gollini, Rasmus Bth, Mark van der Loo, Elizabeth Sweeney, Louis Aslett and Katarina Domijan. With the large volume of submissions, the Associate Editors now play a vital role in processing articles.\nThere are some new developments in the journal operations under way. We are working on a new package rjtools which will operate a little like the devtools package and help you to create a new article from a template, and check that it conforms to the style and requirements of the R Journal.\nWe are also working on supporting articles written in RMarkdown, which will be rendered in html through a modified distill web site. The exciting feature is that interactive graphics could be included directly in the article. You can see how this current issue would look in the new style at rjournal.r-project.org/dev. Particularly, look at articles Conversations in Time by Wang and Cook as an example that has two examples of how interactive graphics might be included. Other articles rendered in html are “Finding Optimal Normalizing Transformations” by Peterson, “Automating Reproducible, Collaborative\nClinical Trial Document Generation” by Kane, Jiang and Urbanek, and “Towards a Grammar for Processing Clinical Trial Data” by Kane. All remaining articles in the new site style are the current pdf style.\nTo experiment with creating a new article, or to check that your article, conforms with the R Journal author guidelines, go to https://rjournal.github.io/rjtools/. Note that it is still ok to use the rticles package R Journal Rmarkdown template to create your article. This will generate the files that are compiled to pdf using latex, but it is an easy translation for us to convert them into the new style.\nThe operational support and the experiments have been supported with generous funding from the R Consortium (https://www.r-consortium.org).\nBehind the scenes, several people are assisting with the journal operations and the new developments. Mitchell O’Hara-Wild has worked on infrastructure, the new article submission system, a new issue build system and now the new article delivery system providing html format. H. Sherry Zhang has taken over from Stephanie Kobakian, in developing the rjtools package including check functions for new articles to help authors get the style constraints correct. In addition, articles in this issue have been painstakingly copy edited by Dewi Amaliah.\n1 In this issue\nNews from the R Core, CRAN, Bioconductor, the R Foundation, and the foRwards Taskforce are included in this issue along with a summary of activities at the R Medicine and Why R? 2021 conferences.\nThis issue features 37 contributed research articles covering these topics:\nMultivariate analysis\nSeedCCA: An integrated R-package for Canonical Correlation Analysis and Partial Least Squares\nUnidimensional and Multidimensional Methods for Recurrence Quantification Analysis with crqa\nclustcurv: An R Package for Determining Groups in Multiple Curves\ngofCopula: Goodness-of-Fit Tests for Copulae\nROCnReg: An R Package for Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve Inference With and Without Covariates\n\nNon-parametric methods\nnpcure: An R Package for Nonparametric Inference in Mixture Cure Models\nROBustness In Network (robin): an R package for Comparison and Validation of Communities\nkrippendorffsalpha: An R Package for Measuring Agreement Using Krippendorff’s Alpha Coefficient\n\nTemporal and longitudinal methods\nJMcmprsk: An R Package for Joint Modelling of Longitudinal and Survival Data with Competing Risks\nLinear Regression with Stationary Errors: the R Package slm\npenPHcure: Variable Selection in Proportional Hazards Cure Model with Time-Varying Covariates\npdynmc: A Package for Estimating Linear Dynamic Panel Data Models Based on Nonlinear Moment Conditions\nDChaos: An R Package for Chaotic Time Series Analysis\nIndexNumber: An R Package for Measuring the Evolution of Magnitudes\ngarchx: Flexible and Robust GARCH-X Modelling\nWorking with CRSP/COMPUSTAT in R: Reproducible Empirical Asset Pricing\nAnalysing Dependence Between Point Processes in Time Using IndTestPP\nConversations in Time: Interactive Visualisation to Explore Structured Temporal Data\n\nComputing infrastructure\nA Method for Deriving Information from Running R Code\nWide-to-tall Data Reshaping Using Regular Expressions and the nc Package\nThe bdpar Package: Big Data Pipelining Architecture for R\nBenchmarking R packages for calculation of Persistent Homology\ndistr6: R6 Object-Oriented Probability Distributions Interface in R\nAutomating Reproducible, Collaborative Clinical Trial Document Generation\nReproducible Summary Tables with the gtsummary Package\nTowards a Grammar for Processing Clinical Trial Data\n\nSimulation and optimisation\nFinding Optimal Normalizing Transformations via bestNormalize\nPackage wsbackfit for Smooth Backfitting Estimation of Generalized Structured\nModels\nRLumCarlo: Simulating Cold Light using Monte Carlo Methods\nOneStep: Le Cam’s one-step estimation procedure\nThe HBV.IANIGLA Hydrological Model\nRegularized Transformation Models: The tramnet Package\n\nOther topics\nexPrior: An R Package for the Formulation of Ex-Situ Priors\nBayesSPsurv: An R Package to Estimate Bayesian (Spatial) Split-Population Survival Models\nStatistical Quality Control with the qcr Package\nThe R Package smicd: Statistical Methods for Interval-Censored Data\nstratamatch: Prognostic Score Stratification Using a Pilot Design\n\nHappy reading, and code testing!\n\n\n\n",
