# R Journal website

The R journal website is published using [github pages](http://pages.github.com/). This makes it easier to manage the articles in git, and the website automatically updated when the git repo is pushed to github.

## Deployment

The `master` branch is the sandbox. It is automatically served at https://rjournal.github.io/ as GitHub pages, and an update is triggered at every push so the site can be previewed prior to merging with the `deploy` branch.

The official website `https://journal.r-project.org/` is synchronised (cron job) by the Vienna team from the `deploy` branch of this repository, which is in turn generated by a GitHub Action from the `published` branch on push. Therefore one can consider the `master` branch as development and merging it into `published` starts the deployment to the official site.

## Building the site locally

You'll need to install the `rjtools` package:

```
install.packages("rjtools",,
    c("https://rforge.net","https://cloud.R-project.org"))
```

Then to create the site use

```
rmarkdown::render_site()
```

and the result will be in the `_web` directory.

## Publishing new articles
## Publishing a new issue

FIXME: this section needs to be updated - generally, the `rj` package should be used for this.
