    bibauthor: Armin Ströbel
    abstract: '  Abstract Examining distributions of variables is the first step in
      the analysis of a clinical trial before            more specific modelling can
      begin. Reporting these results to stakeholders of the trial is an essential            part
      of a statistician’s work. The atable package facilitates these steps by offering
      easy-to-use but still            flexible functions.'

    abstract: '  Abstract The tourr package in R has several algorithms and displays
      for showing multivariate data as            a sequence of low-dimensional projections.
      It can display as a movie but has no capacity for interaction,            such
      as stop/go, change tour type, drop/add variables. The tourrGui package provides
      these sorts            of controls, but the interface is programmed with the
      dated RGtk2 package. This work explores            using custom messages to
      pass data from R to D3 for viewing, using the Shiny framework. This is an            approach
      that can be generally used for creating all sorts of interactive graphics.'

    abstract: '  Abstract The 4 Parameter Logistic (4PL) model has been recognized
      as a major tool to analyze the            relationship between doses and responses
      in pharmacological experiments. A main strength of this            model is
      that each parameter contributes an intuitive meaning enhancing interpretability
      of a fitted            model. However, implementing the 4PL model using conventional
      statistical software often encounters            numerical errors. This paper
      highlights the issue of convergence failure and presents several causes            with
      solutions. These causes include outliers and a non-logistic data shape, so useful
      remedies such            as robust estimation, outlier diagnostics and constrained
      optimization are proposed. These features            are implemented in a new
      R package dr4pl (Dose-Response analysis using the 4 Parameter Logistic            model)
      whose code examples are presented as a separate section. Our R package dr4pl
      is shown to            work well for data sets where the traditional dose-response
      modelling packages drc and nplr fail.'

    abstract: '  Abstract The gold standard of experimental research is the randomized
      control trial. However,            interventions are often implemented without
      a randomized control group for practical or ethical            reasons. Propensity
      score matching (PSM) is a popular method for minimizing the effects of a            randomized
      experiment from observational data by matching members of a treatment group
      to similar            candidates that did not receive the intervention. Traditional
      PSM is not designed for studies that enroll            participants on a rolling
      basis and does not provide a solution for interventions in which the baseline            and
      intervention period are undefined in the comparison group. Rolling Entry Matching
      (REM) is a            new matching method that addresses both issues. REM selects
      comparison members who are similar            to intervention members with respect
      to both static (e.g., race) and dynamic (e.g., health conditions)            characteristics.
      This paper will discuss the key components of REM and introduce the rollmatch
      R            package.'

    abstract: '  Abstract The bayesdfa package provides a flexible Bayesian modeling
      framework for applying dy           namic factor analysis (DFA) to multivariate
      time-series data as a dimension reduction tool. The core            estimation
      is done with the Stan probabilistic programming language. In addition to being
      one of the            few Bayesian implementations of DFA, novel features of
      this model include (1) optionally modeling            latent process deviations
      as drawn from a Student-t distribution to better model extremes, and (2)            optionally
      including autoregressive and moving-average components in the latent trends.
      Besides            estimation, we provide a series of plotting functions to
      visualize trends, loadings, and model pre           dicted values. A secondary
      analysis for some applications is to identify regimes in latent trends. We            provide
      a flexible Bayesian implementation of a Hidden Markov Model — also written with
      Stan — to            characterize regime shifts in latent processes. We provide
      simulation testing and details on parameter            sensitivities in supplementary
      information.'

    abstract: '  Abstract Record linkage aims at quickly and accurately identifying
      if two records represent the same            real world entity. In many applications,
      we are interested in restricting the linkage results to “1 to 1”            links,
      that is a single record does not appear more than once in the output. This can
      be dealt with the            transport algorithm. The optimization problem,
      however, grows quadratically in the size of the input,            quickly becoming
      untreatable for cases with a few thousand records. This paper compares different            solutions,
      provided by some R packages for linear programming solvers. The comparison is
      done            in terms of memory usage and execution time. The aim is to overcome
      the current implementation            in the toolkit RELAIS, specifically developed
      for record linkage problems. The results highlight            improvements beyond
      expectations. In fact the tested solutions allow successfully executing the
      “1 to            1” reduction for large size datasets up to the largest sample
      surveys at National Statistical Institutes.'

    bibauthor: Charlotte Dion and Simone Hermann and Adeline Samson
    abstract: '  Abstract Stochastic differential equations (SDEs) are useful to model
      continuous stochastic processes.            When (independent) repeated temporal
      data are available, variability between the trajectories can be            modeled
      by introducing random effects in the drift of the SDEs. These models are useful
      to analyze            neuronal data, crack length data, pharmacokinetics, financial
      data, to cite some applications among            other. The R package focuses
      on the estimation of SDEs with linear random effects in the drift. The goal            is
      to estimate the common density of the random effects from repeated discrete
      observations of the            SDE. The package mixedsde proposes three estimation
      methods: a Bayesian parametric, a frequentist            parametric and a frequentist
      nonparametric method. The three procedures are described as well as the            main
      functions of the package. Illustrations are presented on simulated and real

    abstract: '  Abstract Gaussian stochastic process (GaSP) emulation is a powerful
      tool for approximating compu           tationally intensive computer models.
      However, estimation of parameters in the GaSP emulator is            a challenging
      task. No closed-form estimator is available and many numerical problems arise
      with            standard estimates, e.g., the maximum likelihood estimator.
      In this package, we implement a marginal            posterior mode estimator,
      for special priors and parameterizations. This estimation method that            meets
      the robust parameter estimation criteria was discussed in Gu et al. (2018);
      mathematical reasons            are provided therein to explain why robust parameter
      estimation can greatly improve predictive            performance of the emulator.
      In addition, inert inputs (inputs that almost have no effect on the            variability
      of a function) can be identified from the marginal posterior mode estimation
      at no extra            computational cost. The package also implements the parallel
      partial Gaussian stochastic process            (PP GaSP) emulator (Gu and Berger
      (2016)) for the scenario where the computer model has multiple            outputs
      on, for example, spatial-temporal coordinates. The package can be operated in
      a default mode,            but also allows numerous user specifications, such
      as the capability of specifying trend functions and            noise terms.
      Examples are studied herein to highlight the performance of the package in terms
      of            out-of-sample prediction.'

    abstract: ' Abstract Fuzzy clustering methods discover fuzzy partitions where
      observations can be softly assigned           to more than one cluster. The
      package fclust is a toolbox for fuzzy clustering in the R programming           language.
      It not only implements the widely used fuzzy k-means (FkM) algorithm, but also
      many FkM           variants. Fuzzy cluster similarity measures, cluster validity
      indices and cluster visualization tools           are also offered. In the current
      version, all the functions are rewritten in the C++ language allowing           their
      application in large-size problems. Moreover, new fuzzy relational clustering
      algorithms for           partitioning qualitative/mixed data are provided together
      with an improved version of the so-called           Gustafson-Kessel algorithm
      to avoid singularity in the cluster covariance matrices. Finally, it is now           possible
      to automatically select the number of clusters by means of the available fuzzy
      cluster validity           indices.'

    abstract: '  Abstract Matching is a well known technique to balance covariates
      distribution between treated and            control units in non-experimental
      studies. In many fields, clustered data are a very common occurrence            in
      the analysis of observational data and the clustering can add potentially interesting

      system is often performed using            simple one-dimensional filtering
      procedures that discard information about interactions between            variables.
      Such an approach may result in removing some relevant variables from consideration.
      Here            we present an R package MDFS (MultiDimensional Feature Selection)
      that performs identification            of informative variables taking into
      account synergistic interactions between multiple descriptors            and
      the decision variable. MDFS is an implementation of an algorithm based on information

      package is implemented in C++. A            high-performance version implemented
      in CUDA C is also available. The application of MDFS is            demonstrated
      using the well-known Madelon dataset, in which a decision variable is generated

      better sensitivity and ranking of importance.'

    abstract: '  Abstract The SimCorrMix package generates correlated continuous (normal,
      non-normal, and mix           ture), binary, ordinal, and count (regular and
      zero-inflated, Poisson and Negative Binomial) variables            that mimic
      real-world data sets. Continuous variables are simulated using either Fleishman’s
      third           order or Headrick’s fifth-order power method transformation.
      Simulation occurs at the component            level for continuous mixture distributions,
      and the target correlation matrix is specified in terms of            correlations
      with components. However, the package contains functions to approximate expected            correlations
      with continuous mixture variables. There are two simulation pathways which calculate            intermediate
      correlations involving count variables differently, increasing accuracy under
      a wide range            of parameters. The package also provides functions to
      calculate cumulants of continuous mixture            distributions, check parameter
      inputs, calculate feasible correlation boundaries, and summarize and            plot
      simulated variables. SimCorrMix is an important addition to existing R simulation

    bibtitle: Time-Series Clustering in R Using the dtwclust Package
    author: Alexis Sardá-Espinosa
    bibauthor: Alexis Sardá-Espinosa
    abstract: '  Abstract Most clustering strategies have not changed considerably
      since their initial definition. The            common improvements are either
      related to the distance measure used to assess dissimilarity, or            the
      function used to calculate prototypes. Time-series clustering is no exception,
      with the Dynamic            Time Warping distance being particularly popular
      in that context. This distance is computationally            expensive, so many
      related optimizations have been developed over the years. Since no single            clustering
      algorithm can be said to perform best on all datasets, different strategies
      must be tested and            compared, so a common infrastructure can be advantageous.
      In this manuscript, a general overview            of shape-based time-series
      clustering is given, including many specifics related to Dynamic Time            Warping
      and associated techniques. At the same time, a description of the dtwclust package
      for the R            statistical software is provided, showcasing how it can
      be used to evaluate many different time-series            clustering procedures.'

    abstract: '  Abstract This paper introduces the shadow package for R. The package
      provides functions for shadow           related calculations in the urban environment,
      namely shadow height, shadow footprint and Sky            View Factor (SVF)
      calculations, as well as a wrapper function to estimate solar radiation while
      taking            shadow effects into account. All functions operate on a layer
      of polygons with a height attribute,            also known as “extruded polygons”
      or 2.5D vector data. Such data are associated with accuracy            limitations
      in representing urban environments. However, unlike 3D models, polygonal layers
      of            building outlines along with their height are abundantly available
      and their processing does not            require specialized closed-source 3D

      SVF and solar radiation calculation capabilities to the open-source spatial

    abstract: '  Abstract High-throughput genomic technologies bring to light a comprehensive
      hallmark of molecular            changes of a disease. It is increasingly evident
      that genes are not isolated from each other and the            identification
      of a gene signature can only partially elucidate the de-regulated biological
      functions in a            disease. The comprehension of how groups of genes
      (pathways) are related to each other (pathway           cross talk) could explain
      biological mechanisms causing diseases. Biological pathways are important            tools
      to identify gene interactions and decrease the large number of genes to be studied
      by partitioning            them into smaller groups. Furthermore, recent scientific
      studies have demonstrated that an integration            of pathways and networks,

    abstract: '  Abstract We have created the R package ciuupi to compute confidence
      intervals that utilize uncertain            prior information in linear regression.
      Unlike post-model-selection confidence intervals, the confidence            interval
      that utilizes uncertain prior information (CIUUPI) implemented in this package
      has, to an            excellent approximation, coverage probability throughout
      the parameter space that is very close to            the desired minimum coverage
      probability. Furthermore, when the uncertain prior information is            correct,
      the CIUUPI is, on average, shorter than the standard confidence interval constructed
      using            the full linear regression model. In this paper we provide
      motivating examples of scenarios where            the CIUUPI may be used. We

    abstract: '  Abstract The cluster randomized trial (CRT) is a randomized controlled
      trial in which randomization            is conducted at the cluster level (e.g.
      school or hospital) and outcomes are measured for each            individual
      within a cluster. Often, the number of clusters available to randomize is small
      (≤ 20), which            increases the chance of baseline covariate imbalance
      between comparison arms. Such imbalance is            particularly problematic
      when the covariates are predictive of the outcome because it can threaten            the
      internal validity of the CRT. Pair-matching and stratification are two restricted
      randomization            approaches that are frequently used to ensure balance
      at the design stage. An alternative, less            commonly-used restricted
      randomization approach is covariate-constrained randomization. Covariate           constrained
      randomization quantifies baseline imbalance of cluster-level covariates using
      a balance            metric and randomly selects a randomization scheme from
      those with acceptable balance by the            balance metric. It is able to
      accommodate multiple covariates, both categorical and continuous. To            facilitate
      implementation of covariate-constrained randomization for the design of two-arm
      parallel            CRTs, we have developed the cvcrand R package. In addition,
      cvcrand also implements the clustered            permutation test for analyzing
      continuous and binary outcomes collected from a CRT designed with            covariate-constrained
      randomization. We used a real cluster randomized trial to illustrate the functions            included

    abstract: '  Abstract Multiple imputation is a tool for parameter estimation and
      inference with partially observed            data, which is used increasingly
      widely in medical and social research. When the data to be imputed            are
      correlated or have a multilevel structure — repeated observations on patients,
      school children            nested in classes within schools within educational
      districts — the imputation model needs to include            this structure.
      Here we introduce our joint modelling package for multiple imputation of multilevel            data,
      jomo, which uses a multivariate normal model fitted by Markov Chain Monte Carlo
      (MCMC).            Compared to previous packages for multilevel imputation,
      e.g. pan, jomo adds the facility to (i) handle            and impute categorical
      variables using a latent normal structure, (ii) impute level-2 variables, and
      (iii)            allow for cluster-specific covariance matrices, including the
      option to give them an inverse-Wishart            distribution at level 2. The
      package uses C routines to speed up the computations and has been            extensively
      validated in simulation studies both by ourselves and others.'

    abstract: '  Abstract It has been well documented that ignoring measurement error
      may result in severely biased            inference results. In recent years,
      there has been limited but increasing research on causal inference            with
      measurement error. In the presence of misclassified binary outcome variable,
      Shu and Yi (2017)            considered the inverse probability weighted estimation
      of the average treatment effect and proposed            valid estimation methods
      to correct for misclassification effects for various settings. To expedite the            application
      of those methods for situations where misclassification in the binary outcome
      variable            is a real concern, we implement correction methods proposed
      by Shu and Yi (2017) and develop            an R package ipwErrorY for general

    bibauthor: Juan Xiong and Grace Y. Yi
    abstract: '  Abstract Though longitudinal data often contain missing responses
      and error-prone covariates,            relatively little work has been available
      to simultaneously correct for the effects of response missingness            and
      covariate measurement error on analysis of longitudinal data. Yi (2008) proposed
      a simulation            based marginal method to adjust for the bias induced
      by measurement error in covariates as well            as by missingness in response.
      The proposed method focuses on modeling the marginal mean and            variance
      structures, and the missing at random mechanism is assumed. Furthermore, the
      distribution            of covariates are left unspecified. These features make
      the proposed method applicable to a broad            settings. In this paper,
      we develop an R package, called swgee, which implements the method            proposed
      by Yi (2008). Moreover, our package includes additional implementation steps
      which extend            the setting considered by Yi (2008). To describe the
      use of the package and its main features, we report            simulation studies
      and analyses of a data set arising from the Framingham Heart Study.'

    abstract: '  Abstract The increasing availability of large but noisy data sets
      with a large number of heterogeneous            variables leads to the increasing
      interest in the automation of common tasks for data analysis. The            most
      time-consuming part of this process is the Exploratory Data Analysis, crucial
      for better domain            understanding, data cleaning, data validation,

      tasks to make the search for new insights easier and faster. In this paper,

    abstract: We are seeing today a widespread, and welcome, tendency for non-computer-specialists
      among statisticians and others to write collections of R functions that organize
      and communicate their work. Along with the flood of software sometimes comes
      an attitude that one need only learn, or teach, a sort of basic how-to-write-the-function
      level of R programming, beyond which most of the detail is unimportant or can
      be absorbed without much discussion. As delusions go, this one is not very objectionable
      if it encourages participation. Nevertheless, a delusion it is. In fact, functions
      are only one of a variety of important facets that R has acquired by intent
      or circumstance during the three-plus decades of the history of the software
      and of its predecessor S. To create valuable and trustworthy software using
      R often requires an understanding of some of these facets and their interrelations.
      This paper identifies six facets, discussing where they came from, how they
      support or conflict with each other, and what implications they have for the
      future of programming with R.

    abstract: 'Open source software (OSS) is typically created in a decentralized
      self-organizing process by a community of developers having the same or similar
      interests (see the famous essay by ?). A key factor for the success of OSS over
      the last two decades is the Internet: Developers who rarely meet face-to-face
      can employ new means of communication, both for rapidly writing and deploying
      software (in the spirit of Linus Torvald’s “release early, release often paradigm”).
      Therefore, many tools emerged that assist a collaborative software development
      process, including in particular tools for source code management (SCM) and

    abstract: The concept of empirical mode decomposition (EMD) and the Hilbert spectrum
      (HS) has been developed rapidly in many disciplines of science and engineering
      since Huang et al. (1998) invented EMD. The key feature of EMD is to decompose
      a signal into so-called intrinsic mode function (IMF). Furthermore, the Hilbert
      spectral analysis of intrinsic mode functions provides frequency information
      evolving with time and quantifies the amount of variation due to oscillation
      at different time scales and time locations. In this article, we introduce an
      R package called EMD (Kim and Oh, 2008) that performs oneand twodimensional
      EMD and HS.

      are rather costly, it is important to have an adequate sample size that will

    abstract: The PMML package exports a variety of predictive and descriptive models
      from R to the Predictive Model Markup Language (Data Mining Group, 2008). PMML
      is an XML-based language and has become the de-facto standard to represent not
      only predictive and descriptive models, but also data preand post-processing.
      In so doing, it allows for the interchange of models among different tools and
      environments, mostly avoiding proprietary issues and incompatibilities.

    abstract: Recursive partitioning methods are amongst the most popular and widely
      used statistical learning tools for nonparametric regression and classification.
      Especially random forests, that can deal with large numbers of predictor variables
      even in the presence of complex interactions, are being applied successfully
      in many scientific fields (see, e.g., ??, and the references therein for applications
      in genetics and social sciences). Thus, it is not surprising that there is a
      variety of recursive partitioning tools available in R (see http://CRAN.R-project.org/view=MachineLearning
      for an overview).

    abstract: Statistical, data manipulation, and presentation tools make R an ideal
      integrated package for research in the fields of health policy and healthcare
      management and evaluation. However, the technical documentation accompanying
      most data sets used by researchers in these fields does not include syntax examples
      for analysts to make the transition from another statistical package to R. This
      paper describes the steps required to import health policy data into R, to prepare
      that data for analysis using the two most common complex survey variance calculation
      techniques, and to produce the principal set of statistical estimates sought
      by health policy researchers. Using data from the Medical Expenditure Panel
      Survey Household Component (MEPS-HC), this paper outlines complex survey data
      analysis techniques in R, with side-by-side comparisons to the SAS, Stata, and
      SUDAAN statistical software packages.

    abstract: The sos package provides a means to quickly and flexibly search the
      help pages of contributed packages, finding functions and datasets in seconds
      or minutes that could not be found in hours or days by any other means we know.
      Its findFn function accesses Jonathan Baron’s R Site Search database and returns
      the matches in a data frame of class "findFn", which can be further manipulated
      by other sos functions to produce, for example, an Excel file that starts with
      a summary sheet that makes it relatively easy to prioritize alternative packages
      for further study. As such, it provides a very powerful way to do a literature
      search for functions and packages relevant to a particular topic of interest
      and could become virtually mandatory for authors of new packages or papers in
      publications such as The R Journal and the Journal of Statistical Software.

      experiments to identify gene or subsets of genes with a monotone relationship
      between the gene expression and the doses. Several testing procedures (i.e.,
      the likelihood ratio test, Williams, Marcus, the M, and Modified M), that take
      into account the order restriction of the means with respect to the increasing
      doses are implemented in the package. The inference is based on resampling methods,

    abstract: Artificial neural networks are applied in many situations. neuralnet
      is built to train multilayer perceptrons in the context of regression analyses,
      i.e. to approximate functional relationships between covariates and response
      variables. Thus, neural networks are used as extensions of generalized linear
      models.       neuralnet is a very flexible package. The backpropagation algorithm
      and three versions of resilient backpropagation are implemented and it provides
      a custom-choice of activation and error function. An arbitrary number of covariates
      and response variables as well as of hidden layers can theoretically be included.       The
      paper gives a brief introduction to multi-layer perceptrons and resilient backpropagation
      and demonstrates the application of neuralnet using the data set infert, which
      is contained in the R distribution.

      Two-sided Exact Tests and Matching Confidence Intervals for

    abstract: '  Abstract There is an inherent relationship between two-sided hypothesis
      tests and confidence intervals.            A series of two-sided hypothesis
      tests may be inverted to obtain the matching 100(1-α)% confidence            interval
      defined as the smallest interval that contains all point null parameter values
      that would not            be rejected at the α level. Unfortunately, for discrete
      data there are several different ways of defining            two-sided exact
      tests and the most commonly used two-sided exact tests are defined one way,
      while            the most commonly used exact confidence intervals are inversions
      of tests defined another way. This            can lead to inconsistencies where
      the exact test rejects but the exact confidence interval contains the            null
      parameter value. The packages exactci and exact2x2 provide several exact tests
      with the matching            confidence intervals avoiding these inconsistencies
      as much as possible. Examples are given for            binomial and Poisson
      parameters and both paired and unpaired 2 × 2 tables.                 Applied
      statisticians are increasingly being encouraged to report confidence intervals
      (CI) and            parameter estimates along with p-values from hypothesis
      tests. The htest class of the stats package            is ideally suited to
      these kinds of analyses, because all the related statistics may be presented

    abstract: Social Network Analysis (SNA) provides tools to examine relationships
      between people. Text Mining (TM) allows capturing the text they produce in Web
      2.0 applications, for example, however it neglects their social structure. This
      paper applies an approach to combine the two methods named “content-based SNA”.
      Using the R mailing lists, R-help and R-devel, we show how this combination
      can be used to describe people’s interests and to find out if authors who have
      similar interests actually communicate. We find that the expected positive relationship
      between sharing interests and communicating gets stronger as the centrality
      scores of authors in the communication networks increase.

      The initial concentration is on data referenced by country or grid due to the
      frequency            of use of such data in global assessments. Tools to link
      data referenced by country (either name or            code) to a map, and then

    abstract: '  Abstract This article describes two R packages for probabilistic
      weather forecasting, ensembleBMA,            which offers ensemble postprocessing
      via Bayesian model averaging (BMA), and ProbForecastGOP,            which implements
      the geostatistical output perturbation (GOP) method. BMA forecasting models            use
      mixture distributions, in which each component corresponds to an ensemble member,
      and the            form of the component distribution depends on the weather
      parameter (temperature, quantitative            precipitation or wind speed).
      The model parameters are estimated from training data. The GOP            technique
      uses geostatistical methods to produce probabilistic forecasts of entire weather
      fields for            temperature or pressure, based on a single numerical forecast
      on a spatial grid. Both packages include            functions for evaluating
      predictive performance, in addition to model fitting and forecasting.'

    author: Ian C. Marschner

    abstract: '  Abstract The R function glm uses step-halving to deal with certain
      types of convergence problems            when using iteratively reweighted least
      squares to fit a generalized linear model. This works well in            some
      circumstances but non-convergence remains a possibility, particularly with a
      non-standard link            function. In some cases this is because step-halving
      is never invoked, despite a lack of convergence. In            other cases step-halving
      is invoked but is unable to induce convergence. One remedy is to impose a            stricter
      form of step-halving than is currently available in glm, so that the deviance
      is forced to decrease            in every iteration. This has been implemented
      in the glm2 function available in the glm2 package.            Aside from a
      modified computational algorithm, glm2 operates in exactly the same way as glm
      and            provides improved convergence properties. These improvements
      are illustrated here with an identity            link Poisson model, but are
      also relevant in other contexts.'

    abstract: '  Abstract Many common diseases, such as the flu and cardiovascular
      disease, increase markedly in            winter and dip in summer. These seasonal
      patterns have been part of life for millennia and were            first noted
      in ancient Greece by both Hippocrates and Herodotus. Recent interest has focused
      on            climate change, and the concern that seasons will become more
      extreme with harsher winter and            summer weather. We describe a set
      of R functions designed to model seasonal patterns in disease.            We
      illustrate some simple descriptive and graphical methods, a more complex method
      that is able to            model non-stationary patterns, and the case-crossover
      to control for seasonal confounding.                 In this paper we illustrate
      some of the functions of the season package (Barnett et al., 2012), which            contains
      a range of functions for analysing seasonal health data. We were motivated by
      the great            interest in seasonality found in the health literature,
      and the relatively small number of seasonal tools            in R (or other
      software packages). The existing seasonal tools in R are:                • the
      baysea function of the timsac package and the decompose and stl functions of
      the stats                    package for decomposing a time series into a trend
      and season;                • the dynlm function of the dynlm package and the
      ssm function of the sspir package for fitting                    dynamic linear
      models with optional seasonal components;                • the arima function
      of the stats package and the Arima function of the forecast package for fitting                    seasonal
      components as part of an autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) model;                    and                •
      the bfast package for detecting breaks in a seasonal pattern.            These
      tools are all useful, but most concern decomposing equally spaced time series
      data. Our package            includes models that can be applied to seasonal
      patterns in unequally spaced data. Such data are            common in observational
      studies when the timing of responses cannot be controlled (e.g. for a postal            survey).                 In
      the health literature much of the analysis of seasonal data uses simple methods
      such as com           paring rates of disease by month or using a cosinor regression
      model, which assumes a sinusoidal            seasonal pattern. We have created
      functions for these simple, but often very effective analyses, as we            describe
      below.                 More complex seasonal analyses examine non-stationary
      seasonal patterns that change over time.            Changing seasonal patterns
      in health are currently of great interest as global warming is predicted to            make
      seasonal changes in the weather more extreme. Hence there is a need for statistical
      tools that            can estimate whether a seasonal pattern has become more
      extreme over time or whether its phase has            changed.                 Ours
      is also the first R package that includes the case-crossover, a useful method
      for controlling for            seasonality.                 This paper illustrates
      just some of the functions of the season package. We show some descriptive            functions
      that give simple means or plots, and functions whose goal is inference based
      on generalised            linear models. The package was written as a companion
      to a book on seasonal analysis by Barnett and            Dobson (2010), which
      contains further details on the statistical methods and R code.'

      with the main functions or develop additional functions to support ‘higher level’            use
      of openair and R.                Large volumes of air quality data are routinely
      collected for regulatory purposes, but few of those            in local authorities
      and government bodies tasked with this responsibility have the time, expertise            or
      funds to comprehensively analyse this potential resource (Chow and Watson, 2008).
      Furthermore,            few of these institutions can routinely access the more

      effective use of such data without a suite of often expensive and niche-application            proprietary

      by one partner cannot be validated or replicated by another because they lack
      access to            the same licensed products.                Being freely
      distributed under general licence, R has the obvious potential to act as a common            platform
      for those routinely collecting and archiving data and the wider air quality
      community.            This potential has already been proven in several other
      research areas, and commonly cited ex           amples include the Bioconductor
      project (Gentleman et al, 2004) and the Epitools collaboration            (http://www.medepi.com/epitools).
      However, what is perhaps most inspiring is the degree of trans           parency
      that has been demonstrated by the recent public analysis of climate change data
      in R and as           sociated open debate (http://chartsgraphs.wordpress.com/category/r-climate-data-analysis           tool/).
      Anyone affected by a policy decision, could potentially have unlimited access
      to scrutinise            both the tools and data used to shape that decision.'

    abstract: '  Abstract Computational infrastructure for representing persons and
      citations has been available in R            for several years, but has been
      restructured through enhanced classes "person" and "bibentry" in            recent
      versions of R. The new features include support for the specification of the
      roles of package            authors (e.g. maintainer, author, contributor, translator,
      etc.) and more flexible formatting/printing            tools among various other
      improvements. Here, we introduce the new classes and their methods            and
      indicate how this functionality is employed in the management of R packages.
      Specifically, we            show how the authors of R packages can be specified
      along with their roles in package ‘DESCRIPTION’            and/or ‘CITATION’
      files and the citations produced from it.                 R packages are the
      result of scholarly activity and as such constitute scholarly resources which            must
      be clearly identifiable for the respective scientific communities and, more
      generally, today’s            information society. In particular, packages published
      by standard repositories can be regarded as            reliable sources which
      can and should be referenced (i.e. cited) by scientific works such as articles
      or            other packages. This requires conceptual frameworks and computational
      infrastructure for describing            bibliographic resources, general enough
      to encompass the needs of communities with an interest in R.            These
      needs include support for exporting bibliographic metadata in standardized formats
      such as            BIBTEX (Berry and Patashnik, 2010), but also facilitating
      bibliometric analyses and investigations of the            social fabric underlying
      the creation of scholarly knowledge.                 The latter requires a richer
      vocabulary than commonly employed by reference management            software
      such as BIBTEX, identifying persons and their roles in relation to bibliographic
      resources. For            example, a thesis typically has an author and advisors.
      Software can have an (original) author and a            translator to another
      language (such as from S to R). The maintainer of an R package is not necessarily            an
      author.                 In this paper, we introduce the base R infrastructure
      (as completely available in R since version            2.14.0) for representing
      and manipulating such scholarly data: objects of class "person" (hereafter,
      per           son objects) hold information about persons, possibly including
      their roles; objects of class "bibentry"            (hereafter, bibentry objects)
      hold bibliographic information in enhanced BIBTEX style, ideally using            person
      objects when referring to persons (such as authors or editors). Furthermore,
      we indicate how            this functionality is employed in the management
      of R packages, in particular in their ‘CITATION’ and           ‘DESCRIPTION’
      files.'

    abstract: '  Abstract The R graphics engine has new support for drawing complex
      paths via the functions            polypath() and grid.path(). This article
      explains what is meant by a complex path and demonstrates            the usefulness
      of complex paths in drawing non-trivial shapes, logos, customised data symbols,
      and            maps.                 One of the design goals of the R graphics
      system is to allow fine control over the small details            of plots.
      One way that the R graphics system does this is by providing access to low-level
      generic            graphics facilities, such as the ability to draw basic shapes
      and the ability to control apparently esoteric,            but still useful,
      features of those shapes, such as the line end style used for drawing lines.                 In
      R version 2.12.0, another low-level graphics facility was added to R: the ability
      to draw complex            paths (not just polygons).                 This article
      describes this new facility and presents some examples that show how complex
      paths            might be useful.'

    abstract: '  Abstract influence.ME provides tools for detecting influential data
      in mixed effects models. The            application of these models has become
      common practice, but the development of diagnostic tools            has lagged
      behind. influence.ME calculates standardized measures of influential data for
      the point            estimates of generalized mixed effects models, such as
      DFBETAS, Cook’s distance, as well as percentile            change and a test
      for changing levels of significance. influence.ME calculates these measures
      of            influence while accounting for the nesting structure of the data.
      The package and measures of            influential data are introduced, a practical
      example is given, and strategies for dealing with influential            data
      are suggested.                 The application of mixed effects regression models
      has become common practice in the field of            social sciences. As used
      in the social sciences, mixed effects regression models take into account            that
      observations on individual respondents are nested within higher-level groups
      such as schools,            classrooms, states, and countries (Snijders and
      Bosker, 1999), and are often referred to as multilevel            regression
      models. Despite these models’ increasing popularity, diagnostic tools to evaluate
      fitted            models lag behind.                 We introduce influence.ME
      (Nieuwenhuis, Pelzer, and te Grotenhuis, 2012), an R-package that            provides
      tools for detecting influential cases in mixed effects regression models estimated
      with lme4            (Bates and Maechler, 2010). It is commonly accepted that
      tests for influential data should be performed            on regression models,
      especially when estimates are based on a relatively small number of cases.            However,
      most existing procedures do not account for the nesting structure of the data.
      As a result,            these existing procedures fail to detect that higher-level
      cases may be influential on estimates of            variables measured at specifically
      that level.                 In this paper, we outline the basic rationale on
      detecting influential data, describe standardized            measures of influence,
      provide a practical example of the analysis of students in 23 schools, and            discuss
      strategies for dealing with influential cases. Testing for influential cases
      in mixed effects            regression models is important, because influential
      data negatively influence the statistical fit and            generalizability
      of the model. In social science applications of mixed models the testing for
      influential            data is especially important, since these models are
      frequently based on large numbers of observations            at the individual
      level while the number of higher level groups is relatively small. For instance,
      Van der            Meer, te Grotenhuis, and Pelzer (2010) were unable to find
      any country-level comparative studies            involving more than 54 countries.
      With such a relatively low number of countries, a single country can            easily
      be overly influential on the parameter estimates of one or more of the country-level
      variables.'

    abstract: '  Abstract In the nineteen seventies, Jurečková and Jaeckel proposed
      rank estimation for linear models.            Since that time, several authors
      have developed inference and diagnostic methods for these estimators.            These
      rank-based estimators and their associated inference are highly efficient and
      are robust to            outliers in response space. The methods include estimation
      of standard errors, tests of general linear            hypotheses, confidence
      intervals, diagnostic procedures including studentized residuals, and measures            of
      influential cases. We have developed an R package, Rfit, for computing of these
      robust procedures.            In this paper we highlight the main features of
      the package. The package uses standard linear model            syntax and includes
      many of the main inference and diagnostic functions.'

    abstract: '  Abstract In this paper we provide a short tutorial illustrating the
      new functions in the package ggm            that deal with ancestral, summary

      of edges) that are important because they capture the modified independence
      structure after            marginalisation over, and conditioning on, nodes
      of directed acyclic graphs. We provide functions to            verify whether
      a mixed graph implies that A is independent of B given C for any disjoint sets
      of nodes            and to generate maximal graphs inducing the same independence
      structure of non-maximal graphs.            Finally, we provide functions to

    abstract: '  Abstract Most programming language communities have naming conventions
      that are generally            agreed upon, that is, a set of rules that governs
      how functions and variables are named. This is not the            case with
      R, and a review of unofficial style guides and naming convention usage on CRAN
      shows            that a number of different naming conventions are currently
      in use. Some naming conventions are,            however, more popular than others
      and as a newcomer to the R community or as a developer of a new            package
      this could be useful to consider when choosing what naming convention to adopt.'

    abstract: '  Abstract Social scientists have long hand-labeled texts to create
      datasets useful for studying topics            from congressional policymaking
      to media reporting. Many social scientists have begun to incorporate            machine
      learning into their toolkits. RTextTools was designed to make machine learning
      accessible            by providing a start-to-finish product in less than 10
      steps. After installing RTextTools, the initial            step is to generate
      a document term matrix. Second, a container object is created, which holds all            the
      objects needed for further analysis. Third, users can use up to nine algorithms
      to train their data.            Fourth, the data are classified. Fifth, the
      classification is summarized. Sixth, functions are available for            performance
      evaluation. Seventh, ensemble agreement is conducted. Eighth, users can cross-validate            their
      data. Finally, users write their data to a spreadsheet, allowing for further
      manual coding if            required.'

    abstract: '  Abstract Many problems in statistics, finance, biology, pharmacology,
      physics, mathematics, eco           nomics, and chemistry involve determination
      of the global minimum of multidimensional functions.            R packages for
      different stochastic methods such as genetic algorithms and differential evolution            have
      been developed and successfully used in the R community. Based on Tsallis statistics,
      the R            package GenSA was developed for generalized simulated annealing
      to process complicated non-linear            objective functions with a large
      number of local minima. In this paper we provide a brief introduction            to
      the R package and demonstrate its utility by solving a non-convex portfolio
      optimization problem            in finance and the Thomson problem in physics.
      GenSA is useful and can serve as a complementary            tool to, rather
      than a replacement for, other widely used R packages for optimization.'

    abstract: '  Abstract We present multiple factor analysis for contingency tables
      (MFACT) and its implementation            in the FactoMineR package. This method,
      through an option of the MFA function, allows us to deal            with multiple
      contingency or frequency tables, in addition to the categorical and quantitative
      multiple            tables already considered in previous versions of the package.
      Thanks to this revised function, either            a multiple contingency table
      or a mixed multiple table integrating quantitative, categorical and            frequency
      data can be tackled.                The FactoMineR package (Lê et al., 2008;
      Husson et al., 2011) offers the most commonly used            principal component
      methods: principal component analysis (PCA), correspondence analysis (CA;            Benzécri,
      1973), multiple correspondence analysis (MCA; Lebart et al., 2006) and multiple
      factor            analysis (MFA; Escofier and Pagès, 2008). Detailed presentations
      of these methods enriched by            numerous examples can be consulted at
      the website http://factominer.free.fr/.                An extension of the MFA
      function that considers contingency or frequency tables as proposed by            Bécue-Bertaut
      and Pagès (2004, 2008) is detailed in this article.                First, an
      example is presented in order to motivate the approach. Next, the mortality
      data used            to illustrate the method are introduced. Then we briefly
      describe multiple factor analysis (MFA)            and present the principles
      of its extension to contingency tables. A real example on mortality data            illustrates
      the handling of the MFA function to analyse these multiple tables and, finally,
      conclusions            are presented.'

    abstract: The package PIN computes a measure of asymmetric information in financial
      markets, the so-called probability of informed trading. This is obtained from
      a sequential trade model and is used to study the determinants of an asset price.
      Since the probability of informed trading depends on the number of buyand sell-initiated
      trades during a trading day, this paper discusses the entire modelling cycle,
      from data handling to the computation of the probability of informed trading
      and the estimation of parameters for the underlying theoretical model.

    abstract: '  Abstract We present the R package stellaR, which is designed to access
      and manipulate publicly            available stellar evolutionary tracks and
      isochrones from the Pisa low-mass database. The procedures            for extracting
      important stages in the evolution of a star from the database, for constructing
      isochrones            from stellar tracks and for interpolating among tracks
      are discussed and demonstrated.                 Due to the advance in the instrumentation,
      nowadays astronomers can deal with a huge amount            of high-quality
      observational data. In the last decade impressive improvements of spectroscopic
      and            photometric observational capabilities made available data which
      stimulated the research in the glob           ular clusters field. The theoretical
      effort of recovering the evolutionary history of the clusters benefits            from
      the computation of extensive databases of stellar tracks and isochrones, such
      as Pietrinferni et al.            (2006); Dotter et al. (2008); Bertelli et
      al. (2008). We recently computed a large data set of stellar tracks            and
      isochrones, “The Pisa low-mass database” (Dell’Omodarme et al., 2012), with
      up to date physical            and chemical inputs, and made available all the
      calculations to the astrophysical community at the            Centre de Données
      astronomiques de Strasbourg (CDS)1 , a data center dedicated to the collection
      and            worldwide distribution of astronomical data.                 In
      most databases, the management of the information and the extraction of the
      relevant evolu           tionary properties from libraries of tracks and/or
      isochrones is the responsibility of the end users.            Due to its extensive
      capabilities of data manipulation and analysis, however, R is an ideal choice
      for            these tasks. Nevertheless R is not yet well known in astrophysics;
      up to December 2012 only seven            astronomical or astrophysical-oriented
      packages have been published on CRAN (see the CRAN Task            View Chemometrics
      and Computational Physics).                 The package stellaR (Dell’Omodarme
      and Valle, 2012) is an effort to make available to the astro           physical
      community a basic tool set with the following capabilities: retrieve the required
      calculations            from CDS; plot the information in a suitable form; construct
      by interpolation tracks or isochrones of            compositions different to
      the ones available in the database; construct isochrones for age not included            in
      the database; extract relevant evolutionary points from tracks or isochrones.'

    abstract: '  Abstract Microarrays enable the expression levels of thousands of
      genes to be measured simultane           ously. However, only a small fraction
      of these genes are expected to be expressed under different            experimental
      conditions. Nowadays, filtering has been introduced as a step in the microarray
      pre           processing pipeline. Gene filtering aims at reducing the dimensionality
      of data by filtering redundant            features prior to the actual statistical
      analysis. Previous filtering methods focus on the Affymetrix            platform
      and can not be easily ported to the Illumina platform. As such, we developed
      a filtering            method for Illumina bead arrays. We developed an R package,
      beadarrayFilter, to implement the            latter method. In this paper, the
      main functions in the package are highlighted and using many            examples,
      we illustrate how beadarrayFilter can be used to filter bead arrays.'

    abstract: '  Abstract One of the most powerful features of R is its infrastructure
      for contributed code. The            built-in package manager and complementary
      repositories provide a great system for development            and exchange
      of code, and have played an important role in the growth of the platform towards
      the            de-facto standard in statistical computing that it is today.
      However, the number of packages on CRAN            and other repositories has
      increased beyond what might have been foreseen, and is revealing some            limitations
      of the current design. One such problem is the general lack of dependency versioning
      in            the infrastructure. This paper explores this problem in greater
      detail, and suggests approaches taken            by other open source communities
      that might work for R as well. Three use cases are defined that            exemplify
      the issue, and illustrate how improving this aspect of package management could
      increase            reliability while supporting further growth of the R community.'

      Software packages that interpret the BUGS language            include OpenBUGS,
      WinBUGS, and JAGS. R packages that link BUGS software to the R environment,            including
      rjags and R2WinBUGS, are widely used in Bayesian analysis. Indeed, many packages

    abstract: '  Abstract Recent statistical literature has paid attention to the
      presentation of pairwise comparisons            either from the point of view
      of the reference category problem in generalized linear models (GLMs)            or
      in terms of multiple comparisons. Both schools of thought are interested in
      the parsimonious            presentation of sufficient information to enable
      readers to evaluate the significance of contrasts            resulting from
      the inclusion of qualitative variables in GLMs. These comparisons also arise
      when            trying to interpret multinomial models where one category of
      the dependent variable is omitted as            a reference. While considerable
      advances have been made, opportunities remain to improve the            presentation
      of this information, especially in graphical form. The factorplot package provides
      new            functions for graphically and numerically presenting results
      of hypothesis tests related to pairwise            comparisons resulting from
      qualitative covariates in GLMs or coefficients in multinomial logistic            regression
      models.'

    abstract: '  Abstract Currently, a part of the R statistical software is developed
      in order to deal with spatial models.            More specifically, some available
      packages allow the user to analyse categorical spatial random            patterns.
      However, only the spMC package considers a viewpoint based on transition probabilities            between
      locations. Through the use of this package it is possible to analyse the spatial
      variability of            data, make inference, predict and simulate the categorical
      classes in unobserved sites. An example is            presented by analysing
      the well-known Swiss Jura data set.'

    abstract: ' Abstract Nucleic acid Melting Curve Analysis is a powerful method
      to investigate the interaction           of double stranded nucleic acids. Many
      researchers rely on closed source software which is not           ubiquitously
      available, and gives only little control over the computation and data presentation.           R
      in contrast, is open source, highly adaptable and provides numerous utilities
      for data import,           sophisticated statistical analysis and presentation

      the MBmca package, for DNA Melting Curve Analysis on microbead surfaces.           Particularly,
      the use of the second derivative melting peaks is suggested as an additional
      parameter to           characterize the melting behavior of DNA duplexes. Examples

    abstract: '  Abstract Comparing two proportions through the difference is a basic
      problem in statistics and has            applications in many fields. More than
      twenty confidence intervals (Newcombe, 1998a,b) have been            proposed.
      Most of them are approximate intervals with an asymptotic infimum coverage probability            much
      less than the nominal level. In addition, large sample may be costly in practice.
      So exact            optimal confidence intervals become critical for drawing
      valid statistical inference with accuracy and            precision. Recently,
      Wang (2010, 2012) derived the exact smallest (optimal) one-sided 1 − α confidence            intervals
      for the difference of two paired or independent proportions. His intervals,
      however, are            computer-intensive by nature. In this article, we provide
      an R package ExactCIdiff to implement the            intervals when the sample
      size is not large. This would be the first available package in R to calculate            the
      exact confidence intervals for the difference of proportions. Exact two-sided
      1 − α interval can be            easily obtained by taking the intersection
      of the lower and upper one-sided 1 − α/2 intervals. Readers            may jump
      to Examples 1 and 2 to obtain these intervals.'

    abstract: '  Abstract R offers several extension packages that allow it to perform

      degree of parallelization in the resulting computation. An implementation is

      to jumps or outliers, and by its exponential specification of volatility. The
      latter enables            richer dynamics, since parameters need not be restricted

      model also allows for heavy tails and skewness in the conditional return (i.e.
      scaled            return), and for leverage and a time-varying long-term component
      in the volatility specification. More            generally, the model can be

      to Major League Baseball Advanced Media (MLBAM)’s Gameday data. With pitchRx,            one
      can easily obtain and store Gameday data in a remote database. The Gameday website
      hosts a            wealth of XML data, but perhaps most interesting is PITCHf/x.
      Among other things, PITCHf/x data            can be used to recreate a baseball’s
      flight path from a pitcher’s hand to home plate. With pitchRx, one            can
      easily create animations and interactive 3D scatterplots of the baseball’s flight
      path. PITCHf/x data            is also commonly used to generate a static plot
      of baseball locations at the moment they cross home            plate. These
      plots, sometimes called strike-zone plots, can also refer to a plot of event
      probabilities            over the same region. pitchRx provides an easy and
      robust way to generate strike-zone plots using            the ggplot2 package.'

    abstract: '  Abstract Interval censored outcomes arise when a silent event of
      interest is known to have occurred            within a specific time period
      determined by the times of the last negative and first positive diagnostic            tests.
      There is a rich literature on parametric and non-parametric approaches for the
      analysis of            interval-censored outcomes. A commonly used strategy
      is to use a proportional hazards (PH) model            with the baseline hazard
      function parameterized. The proportional hazards assumption can be relaxed            in
      stratified models by allowing the baseline hazard function to vary across strata
      defined by a subset of            explanatory variables. In this paper, we describe
      and implement a new R package straweib, for fitting            a stratified
      Weibull model appropriate for interval censored outcomes. We illustrate the
      R package            straweib by analyzing data from a longitudinal oral health
      study on the timing of the emergence of            permanent teeth in 4430 children.'

      both modeling and clustering            tools for ranking data, potentially

      Rank (ISR) model, which is a meaningful model parametrized by a central ranking
      and a            dispersion parameter. A conditional independence assumption
      allows multivariate rankings to be            taken into account, and clustering
      is performed by means of mixtures of multivariate ISR models.            The
      parameters of the cluster (central rankings and dispersion parameters) help
      the practitioners            to interpret the clustering. Moreover, the Rankcluster
      package provides an estimate of the missing            ranking positions when
      rankings are partial. After an overview of the mixture of multivariate ISR            models,
      the Rankcluster package is described and its use is illustrated through the

    abstract: '  Abstract As expression microarrays are typically designed relative
      to a reference genome, any            individual genetic variant that overlaps
      a probe’s genomic position can possibly cause a reduction            in hybridization
      due to the probe no longer being a perfect match to a given sample’s mRNA at            that
      locus. If the samples or groups used in a microarray study differ in terms of
      genetic variants,            the results of the microarray experiment can be
      negatively impacted. The oligoMask package is an            R/SQLite framework
      which can utilize publicly available genetic variants and works in conjunction            with
      the oligo package to read in the expression data and remove microarray probes
      which are likely            to impact a given microarray experiment prior to
      analysis. Tools are provided for creating an SQLite            database containing
      the probe and variant annotations and for performing the commonly used RMA            preprocessing
      procedure for Affymetrix microarrays. The oligoMask package is freely available
      at            https://github.com/dbottomly/oligoMask.'

    abstract: '  Abstract This paper outlines how to conduct a simple meta-analysis
      of neuroimaging foci of activation            in R. In particular, the first
      part of this paper reviews the nature of fMRI data, and briefly overviews            the
      existing packages that can be used to analyze fMRI data in R. The second part
      illustrates how            to handle fMRI data by showing how to visualize the
      results of different neuroimaging studies in a            so-called orthographic
      view, where the spatial distribution of the foci of activation from different
      fMRI            studies can be inspected visually.                 Functional
      MRI (fMRI) is one of the most important and powerful tools of neuroscientific
      research.            Although not as commonly used for fMRI analysis as some
      specific applications such as SPM (Friston            et al., 2006), AFNI (Cox
      and Hyde, 1997), or FSL (Smith et al., 2004), R does provide several packages            that
      can be employed in neuroimaging research. These packages deal with a variety
      of topics, ranging            from reading and manipulating fMRI datasets, to
      implementing sophisticated statistical models.                 The goal of this
      paper is to provide a brief introduction to fMRI analysis, and the various R            packages
      that can be used to carry it out. As an example, it will show how to use simple
      R commands            to read fMRI images and plot results from previous studies,
      which can then be visually compared. This            is a special form of meta-analysis,
      and a common way to compare results from the existing literature.'

    bibtitle: Automatic Conversion of Tables to LongForm Dataframes

    abstract: '  Abstract TableToLongForm automatically converts hierarchical Tables
      intended for a human reader            into a simple LongForm dataframe that
      is machine readable, making it easier to access and use the data            for
      analysis. It does this by recognising positional cues present in the hierarchical
      Table (which would            normally be interpreted visually by the human
      brain) to decompose, then reconstruct the data into a            LongForm dataframe.
      The article motivates the benefit of such a conversion with an example Table,            followed
      by a short user manual, which includes a comparison between the simple one argument
      call            to TableToLongForm, with code for an equivalent manual conversion.
      The article then explores the            types of Tables the package can convert
      by providing a gallery of all recognised patterns. It finishes            with
      a discussion of available diagnostic methods and future work.'

    abstract: '  Abstract Principal Components Analysis (PCA) is a common way to study
      the sources of variation in            a high-dimensional data set. Typically,
      the leading principal components are used to understand the            variation
      in the data or to reduce the dimension of the data for subsequent analysis.
      The remaining            principal components are ignored since they explain
      little of the variation in the data. However, the            space spanned by
      the low variation principal components may contain interesting structure, structure            that
      PCA cannot find. Prinsimp is an R package that looks for interesting structure

      contains functions for performing            various data processing procedures,
      such as identifying periods of non-wear time and bouts of activity.            The
      functions are flexible, computationally efficient, and compatible with uniaxial
      or triaxial data.            The package nhanesaccel is specifically for processing
      data from the National Health and Nutrition            Examination Survey (NHANES),
      years 2003–2006. Its primary function generates measures of PA            volume,
      intensity, frequency, and patterns according to user-specified data processing
      methods. This            function can process the NHANES 2003-2006 dataset in
      under one minute, which is a drastic improve           ment over existing software.
      This article highlights important features of packages accelerometry and            nhanesaccel

      rate (FWER) based            methods in certain situations, particularly when
      the number of tests is large. This package includes Bi           nomial and
      Conservative SGoF and the Bayesian and Beta-Binomial SGoF multiple testing procedures,            which
      are adaptations of the original SGoF method to the Bayesian setting and to possibly
      correlated            tests, respectively. The sgof package also implements
      the Benjamini-Hochberg and Benjamini-Yekutieli            FDR controlling procedures.
      For each method the package provides (among other things) the number            of
      rejected null hypotheses, estimation of the corresponding FDR, and the set of
      adjusted p values.            Some automatic plots of interest are implemented
      too. Two real data examples are used to illustrate            how sgof works.'

    abstract: '  Abstract The hazard function is a key component in the inferential
      process in survival analysis and            relevant for describing the pattern
      of failures. However, it is rarely shown in research papers due            to
      the difficulties in nonparametric estimation. We developed the bshazard package
      to facilitate the            computation of a nonparametric estimate of the
      hazard function, with data-driven smoothing. The            method accounts
      for left truncation, right censoring and possible covariates. B-splines are
      used to            estimate the shape of the hazard within the generalized linear
      mixed models framework. Smoothness is            controlled by imposing an autoregressive
      structure on the baseline hazard coefficients. This perspective            allows
      an ’automatic’ smoothing by avoiding the need to choose the smoothing parameter,
      which is            estimated from the data as a dispersion parameter. A simulation
      study demonstrates the capability            of our software and an application
      to estimate the hazard of Non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma in Swedish            population
      data shows its potential.'

    abstract: '  Abstract Assessing the assumption of multivariate normality is required
      by many parametric mul           tivariate statistical methods, such as MANOVA,
      linear discriminant analysis, principal component            analysis, canonical
      correlation, etc. It is important to assess multivariate normality in order
      to proceed            with such statistical methods. There are many analytical
      methods proposed for checking multivariate            normality. However, deciding
      which method to use is a challenging process, since each method may            give
      different results under certain conditions. Hence, we may say that there is
      no best method, which            is valid under any condition, for normality
      checking. In addition to numerical results, it is very useful            to
      use graphical methods to decide on multivariate normality. Combining the numerical
      results from            several methods with graphical approaches can be useful
      and provide more reliable decisions. Here,            we present an R package,
      MVN, to assess multivariate normality. It contains the three most widely            used
      multivariate normality tests, including Mardia’s, Henze-Zirkler’s and Royston’s,
      and graphical            approaches, including chi-square Q-Q, perspective and
      contour plots. It also includes two multivariate            outlier detection
      methods, which are based on robust Mahalanobis distances. Moreover, this package            offers
      functions to check the univariate normality of marginal distributions through
      both tests and            plots. Furthermore, especially for non-R users, we
      provide a user-friendly web application of the            package. This application
      is available at http://www.biosoft.hacettepe.edu.tr/MVN/.'

      The methodology is semi-qualitative and the data are analysed            using
      data reduction methods to discern the existing patterns of thought. This package
      is the first to            perform Q analysis in R, and it provides many advantages

      algorithms can be transparently examined, it provides results in a clearly structured            and
      tabulated form ready for further exploration and modelling, it produces a graphical
      summary            of the results, and it generates a more concise report of

      sparkTable,            statistical tables holding quantitative information can
      be enhanced by including spark-type graphs            such as sparklines                and
      sparkbars              .                  These kind of graphics are well-known

      graphs that are small enough to fit in a single line. Thus, they can easily
      enrich tables and            texts with additional information in a comprehensive

      graphs can be added and removed in an interactive            manner. Thereby
      it is possible to produce custom-tailored graphical tables – standard tables

      The first function (rdrobust) implements conventional local-polynomial RD treatment            effect
      point estimators and confidence intervals, as well as robust bias-corrected
      confidence intervals,            for average treatment effects at the cutoff.
      This function covers sharp RD, sharp kink RD, fuzzy RD            and fuzzy
      kink RD designs, among other possibilities. The second function (rdbwselect)
      implements            several bandwidth selectors proposed in the RD literature.
      The third function (rdplot) provides            data-driven optimal choices
      of evenly-spaced and quantile-spaced partition sizes, which are used to            implement

    abstract: '  Abstract Data from complex survey designs require special consideration
      with regard to estimation            of finite population parameters and corresponding
      variance estimation procedures, as a consequence            of significant departures
      from the simple random sampling assumption. In the past decade a number            of
      statistical software packages have been developed to facilitate the analysis
      of complex survey            data. All these statistical software packages are
      able to treat samples selected from one sampling            frame containing
      all population units. Dual frame surveys are very useful when it is not possible
      to            guarantee a complete coverage of the target population and may
      result in considerable cost savings            over a single frame design with
      comparable precision. There are several estimators available in the            statistical
      literature but no existing software covers dual frame estimation procedures.
      This gap is now            filled by package Frames2. In this paper we highlight
      the main features of the package. The package            includes the main estimators
      in dual frame surveys and also provides interval confidence estimation.'

      files that do not rely on the fonts that create them. It supports a large number
      of font formats            and R graphics devices, and meanwhile provides convenient
      features such as using web fonts and            integrating with knitr. This

    abstract: '  Abstract Correspondence analysis on generalised aggregated lexical
      tables (CA-GALT) is a method            that generalizes classical CA-ALT to
      the case of several quantitative, categorical and mixed variables.            It
      aims to establish a typology of the external variables and a typology of the
      events from their mutual            relationships. In order to do so, the influence
      of external variables on the lexical choices is untangled            cancelling
      the associations among them, and to avoid the instability issued from multicollinearity,
      they            are substituted by their principal components. The CaGalt function,
      implemented in the FactoMineR            package, provides numerous numerical
      and graphical outputs. Confidence ellipses are also provided            to validate
      and improve the representation of words and variables. Although this methodology
      was            developed mainly to give an answer to the problem of analyzing
      open-ended questions, it can be            applied to any kind of frequency/contingency
      table with external variables.'

      at both partiallyand fully-persistent versions of queues, comparing            their
      performance characteristics. Finally, we illustrate the usefulness of such dynamic
      structures with            examples of generating and solving mazes.'

    abstract: '  Abstract There is an ever-increasing number of applications, which
      use quantitative PCR (qPCR) or            digital PCR (dPCR) to elicit fundamentals
      of biological processes. Moreover, quantitative isother           mal amplification
      (qIA) methods have become more prominent in life sciences and point-of-care           diagnostics.
      Additionally, the analysis of melting data is essential during many experiments.
      Several            software packages have been developed for the analysis of
      such datasets. In most cases, the software            is either distributed
      as closed source software or as monolithic block with little freedom to perform            highly
      customized analysis procedures. We argue, among others, that R is an excellent
      foundation            for reproducible and transparent data analysis in a highly
      customizable cross-platform environment.            However, for novices it
      is often challenging to master R or learn capabilities of the vast number            of
      packages available. In the paper, we describe exemplary workflows for the analysis
      of qPCR,            qIA or dPCR experiments including the analysis of melting
      curve data. Our analysis relies entirely            on R packages available
      from public repositories. Additionally, we provide information related to            standardized
      and reproducible research.'

    abstract: '  Abstract This paper describes the R package VSURF. Based on random
      forests, and for both regression            and classification problems, it
      returns two subsets of variables. The first is a subset of important            variables
      including some redundancy which can be relevant for interpretation, and the
      second one            is a smaller subset corresponding to a model trying to
      avoid redundancy focusing more closely on            the prediction objective.
      The two-stage strategy is based on a preliminary ranking of the explanatory            variables
      using the random forests permutation-based score of importance and proceeds
      using a            stepwise forward strategy for variable introduction. The
      two proposals can be obtained automatically            using data-driven default
      values, good enough to provide interesting results, but strategy can also            be
      tuned by the user. The algorithm is illustrated on a simulated example and its
      applications to real            datasets are presented.'

    abstract: ' Abstract The beta distribution is a versatile function that accommodates
      a broad range of probability           distribution shapes. Beta regression
      based on the beta distribution can be used to model a response           variable
      y that takes values in open unit interval (0, 1). Zero/one inflated beta (ZOIB)
      regression           models can be applied when y takes values from closed unit
      interval [0, 1]. The ZOIB model is based a           piecewise distribution
      that accounts for the probability mass at 0 and 1, in addition to the probability           density
      within (0, 1). This paper introduces an R package – zoib that provides Bayesian
      inferences for           a class of ZOIB models. The statistical methodology
      underlying the zoib package is discussed, the           functions covered by
      the package are outlined, and the usage of the package is illustrated with three           examples
      of different data and model types. The package is comprehensive and versatile
      in that it           can model data with or without inflation at 0 or 1, accommodate
      clustered and correlated data via           latent variables, perform penalized
      regression as needed, and allow for model comparison via the           computation
      of the DIC criterion.'

      for numerical calculation of            hypergeometric functions. The package

      function over the whole of the complex plane within the constraints of fixed-precision            arithmetic.
      The hypergeometric series is convergent only within the unit circle, so analytic
      continuation            must be used to define the function outside the unit
      circle. This short document outlines the numerical            and conceptual

      to            maintain transparent and verifiable links between the software

    abstract: '  Abstract The problem of comparing a new solution method against existing
      ones to find statistically            significant differences arises very often
      in sciences and engineering. When the problem instance being            solved
      is defined by several parameters, assessing a number of methods with respect
      to many problem            configurations simultaneously becomes a hard task.
      Some visualization technique is required for            presenting a large number
      of statistical significance results in an easily interpretable way. Here we            review
      an existing color-based approach called Statistical Ranking Color Scheme (SRCS)
      for displaying            the results of multiple pairwise statistical comparisons
      between several methods assessed separately on            a number of problem
      configurations. We introduce an R package implementing SRCS, which performs            all
      the pairwise statistical tests from user data and generates customizable plots.
      We demonstrate            its applicability on two examples from the areas of
      dynamic optimization and machine learning, in            which several algorithms
      are compared on many problem instances, each defined by a combination of            parameters.'

    abstract: '  Abstract Along with increased complexity of the models used for scientific
      activities and engineering            come diverse and greater uncertainties.
      Today, effectively quantifying the uncertainties contained            in a model
      appears to be more important than ever. Scientific fellows know how serious
      it is to            calibrate their model in a robust way, and decision-makers
      describe how critical it is to keep the best            effort to reduce the
      uncertainties about the model. Effectively accessing the uncertainties about
      the            model requires mastering all the tasks involved in the numerical
      experiments, from optimizing the            experimental design to managing
      the very time consuming aspect of model simulation and choosing            the
      adequate indicators and analysis methods.                 In this paper, we
      present an open framework for organizing the complexity associated with            numerical
      model simulation and analyses. Named mtk (Mexico Toolkit), the developed system
      aims            at providing practitioners from different disciplines with a
      systematic and easy way to compare and            to find the best method to
      effectively uncover and quantify the uncertainties contained in the model            and
      further to evaluate their impact on the performance of the model. Such requirements
      imply that            the system must be generic, universal, homogeneous, and
      extensible. This paper discusses such an            implementation using the
      R scientific computing platform and demonstrates its functionalities with            examples
      from agricultural modeling.                 The package mtk is of general purpose
      and easy to extend. Numerous methods are already            available in the
      actual release version, including Fast, Sobol, Morris, Basic Monte-Carlo, Regression,            LHS
      (Latin Hypercube Sampling), PLMM (Polynomial Linear metamodel). Most of them
      are compiled            from available R packages with extension tools delivered
      by package mtk.'

    abstract: '  Abstract This paper describes treeClust, an R package that produces
      dissimilarities useful for cluster           ing. These dissimilarities arise
      from a set of classification or regression trees, one with each variable in            the
      data acting in turn as a the response, and all others as predictors. This use
      of trees produces dissim           ilarities that are insensitive to scaling,
      benefit from automatic variable selection, and appear to perform            well.
      The software allows a number of options to be set, affecting the set of objects
      returned in the call;            the user can also specify a clustering algorithm
      and, optionally, return only the clustering vector. The            package can
      also generate a numeric data set whose inter-point distances relate to the treeClust
      ones;            such a numeric data set can be much smaller than the vector
      of inter-point dissimilarities, a useful            feature in big data sets.'

    abstract: '  Abstract A simple temporal point process (SPP) is an important class
      of time series, where the sample            realization of the process is solely
      composed of the times at which events occur. Particular examples            of
      point process data are neuronal spike patterns or spike trains, and a large
      number of distance and            similarity metrics for those data have been
      proposed. A marked point process (MPP) is an extension            of a simple
      temporal point process, in which a certain vector valued mark is associated
      with each of            the temporal points in the SPP. Analyses of MPPs are
      of practical importance because instances of            MPPs include recordings
      of natural disasters such as earthquakes and tornadoes. In this paper, we            introduce
      the R package mmpp, which implements a number of distance and similarity metrics

    abstract: '  Abstract The rivr package provides a computational toolset for simulating
      steady and unsteady one           dimensional flows in open channels. It is

      open-channel hydrodynamics courses in such diverse fields as river engineering,            physical
      geography and geophysics. The governing equations used to describe open-channel
      flows            are briefly presented, followed by example applications. These
      include the computation of gradually           varied flows and two examples
      of unsteady flows in channels—namely, the tracking of the evolution            of
      a flood wave in a channel and the prediction of extreme variation in the water-surface
      profile            that results when a sluice gate is abruptly closed. Model
      results for the unsteady flow examples            are validated against standard
      benchmarks. The article concludes with a discussion of potential            modifications

    abstract: '  Abstract The Generalized Hermite distribution (and the Hermite distribution
      as a particular case) is            often used for fitting count data in the
      presence of overdispersion or multimodality. Despite this, to            our
      knowledge, no standard software packages have implemented specific functions
      to compute basic            probabilities and make simple statistical inference
      based on these distributions. We present here a set            of computational
      tools that allows the user to face these difficulties by modelling with the
      Generalized            Hermite distribution using the R package hermite. The
      package can also be used to generate random            deviates from a Generalized
      Hermite distribution and to use basic functions to compute probabilities            (density,
      cumulative density and quantile functions are available), to estimate parameters
      using the            maximum likelihood method and to perform the likelihood
      ratio test for Poisson assumption against a            Generalized Hermite alternative.
      In order to improve the density and quantile functions performance            when
      the parameters are large, Edgeworth and Cornish-Fisher expansions have been
      used. Hermite            regression is also a useful tool for modeling inflated
      count data, so its inclusion to a commonly used            software like R will
      make this tool available to a wide range of potential users. Some examples of            usage
      in several fields of application are also given.'

    abstract: '  Abstract Code analysis tools are crucial to understand program behavior.
      Profile tools use the results            of time measurements in the execution
      of a program to gain this understanding and thus help in the            optimization
      of the code. In this paper, we review the different available packages to profile
      R code            and show the advantages and disadvantages of each of them.
      In additon, we present GUIProfiler, a            package that fulfills some
      unmet needs.                 Package GUIProfiler generates an HTML report with
      the timing for each code line and the            relationships between different
      functions. This package mimics the behavior of the MATLAB profiler.            The
      HTML report includes information on the time spent on each of the lines of the
      profiled code            (the slowest code is highlighted). If the package is
      used within the RStudio environment, the user            can navigate across
      the bottlenecks in the code and open the editor to modify the lines of code
      where            more time is spent. It is also possible to edit the code using
      Notepad++ (a free editor for Windows) by            simply clicking on the corresponding
      line. The graphical user interface makes it easy to identify the            specific
      lines which slow down the code.                 The integration in RStudio and
      the generation of an HTML report makes GUIProfiler a very            convenient
      tool to perform code optimization.'

    abstract: '  Abstract The metaplus package is described with examples of its use
      for fitting meta-analysis and            meta-regression. For either meta-analysis
      or meta-regression it is possible to fit one of three models:            standard
      normal random effect, t-distribution random effect or mixture of normal random
      effects. The            latter two models allow for robustness by allowing for
      a random effect distribution with heavier tails            than the normal distribution,
      and for both robust models the presence of outliers may be tested using            the
      parametric bootstrap. For the mixture of normal random effects model the outlier
      studies may be            identified through their posterior probability of
      membership in the outlier component of the mixture.            Plots allow the
      results of the different models to be compared. The package is demonstrated
      on three            examples: a meta-analysis with no outliers, a meta-analysis
      with an outlier and a meta-regression with            an outlier.'

      prediction method with optimal parameters and performing validation            studies
      using the best data source for a given purpose. There is also a need to monitor

    abstract: '  Abstract This software paper describes ‘Stylometry with R’ (stylo),
      a flexible R package for the high           level analysis of writing style
      in stylometry. Stylometry (computational stylistics) is concerned with the            quantitative
      study of writing style, e.g. authorship verification, an application which has
      considerable            potential in forensic contexts, as well as historical
      research. In this paper we introduce the possibilities            of stylo for
      computational text analysis, via a number of dummy case studies from English
      and French            literature. We demonstrate how the package is particularly
      useful in the exploratory statistical analysis            of texts, e.g. with
      respect to authorial writing style. Because stylo provides an attractive graphical
      user            interface for high-level exploratory analyses, it is especially
      suited for an audience of novices, without            programming skills (e.g.
      from the Digital Humanities). More experienced users can benefit from our            implementation
      of a series of standard pipelines for text processing, as well as a number of
      similarity            metrics.'

    abstract: '  Abstract In multiple regression models, when there are a large number
      (p) of explanatory variables            which may or may not be relevant for
      predicting the response, it is useful to be able to reduce the model.            To
      this end, it is necessary to determine the best subset of q (q ≤ p) predictors
      which will establish            the model with the best prediction capacity.
      FWDselect package introduces a new forward stepwise           based selection
      procedure to select the best model in different regression frameworks (parametric            or
      nonparametric). The developed methodology, which can be equally applied to linear
      models,            generalized linear models or generalized additive models,
      aims to introduce solutions to the following            two topics: i) selection
      of the best combination of q variables by using a step-by-step method; and,            perhaps,

      between people engaged in collaborative activities. While there            has

      suited for validating social network analyses. Using our web-based survey application,

    abstract: '  Abstract In crossed, two-factor studies with one observation per
      factor-level combination, interaction            effects between factors can
      be hard to detect and can make the choice of a suitable statistical model            difficult.
      This article describes hiddenf, an R package that enables users to quantify
      and characterize a            certain form of interaction in two-factor layouts.
      When effects of one factor (a) fall into two groups            depending on
      the level of another factor, and (b) are constant within these groups, the interaction            pattern
      is deemed "hidden additivity" because within groups, the effects of the two
      factors are additive,            while between groups the factors are allowed
      to interact. The hiddenf software can be used to estimate,            test,
      and report an appropriate factorial effects model corresponding to hidden additivity,
      which is            intermediate between the unavailable full factorial model
      and the overly-simplistic additive model.            Further, the software also
      conducts five statistical tests for interaction proposed between 1949 and            2014.
      A collection of 17 datasets is used for illustration.'

      and            Jarque-Bera goodness-of-fit procedures are provided along with
      cryptographic randomness tests.            CryptRndTest utilizes multiple precision
      floating numbers for sequences longer than 64-bit based            on the package
      Rmpfr. By this way, included tests are applied precisely for higher bit-lengths.
      In            addition CryptRndTest provides a user friendly interface to these
      cryptographic randomness tests.            As an illustrative application, CryptRndTest
      is used to test available random number generators in R.'

    abstract: '  Abstract Comparing the results obtained by two or more algorithms
      in a set of problems is a central            task in areas such as machine learning
      or optimization. Drawing conclusions from these comparisons            may require
      the use of statistical tools such as hypothesis testing. There are some interesting
      papers            that cover this topic. In this manuscript we present scmamp,
      an R package aimed at being a tool            that simplifies the whole process
      of analyzing the results obtained when comparing algorithms, from            loading
      the data to the production of plots and tables.                 Comparing the
      performance of different algorithms is an essential step in many research and            practical
      computational works. When new algorithms are proposed, they have to be compared
      with            the state of the art. Similarly, when an algorithm is used for
      a particular problem, its performance with            different sets of parameters
      has to be compared, in order to tune them for the best results.                 When
      the differences are very clear (e.g., when an algorithm is the best in all the

      may be enough. However, this is an unusual            situation and, thus, in
      most situations a direct comparison may be misleading and not enough to draw            sound
      conclusions; in those cases, the statistical assessment of the results is advisable.                 The
      statistical comparison of algorithms in the context of machine learning has
      been covered in            several papers. In particular, the tools implemented
      in this package are those presented in Demšar            (2006); García and
      Herrera (2008); García et al. (2010). Another good review that covers, among
      other            aspects, the statistical assessment of the results in the context
      of supervised classification can be found            in Santafé et al. (2015).'

    abstract: '  Abstract Interest in social network analysis has exploded in the
      past few years, partly thanks to            the advancements in statistical
      methods and computing for network analysis. A wide range of the            methods
      for network analysis is already covered by existent R packages. However, no
      comprehensive            packages are available to calculate group centrality
      scores and to identify key players (i.e., those players            who constitute
      the most central group) in a network. These functionalities are important because,            for
      example, many social and health interventions rely on key players to facilitate
      the intervention.            Identifying key players is challenging because
      players who are individually the most central are not            necessarily
      the most central as a group due to redundancy in their connections. In this
      paper we            develop methods and tools for computing group centrality
      scores and for identifying key players in            social networks. We illustrate
      the methods using both simulated and empirical examples. The package            keyplayer
      providing the presented methods is available from Comprehensive R Archive Network            (CRAN).'

    abstract: '  Abstract The general clustering algorithms do not guarantee optimality
      because of the hardness of the            problem. Polynomial-time methods can
      find the clustering corresponding to the exact optimum only            in special
      cases. For example, the dynamic programming algorithm can solve the one-dimensional            clustering
      problem, i.e., when the items to be clustered can be characterised by only one
      scalar            number. Optimal one-dimensional clustering is provided by

      the dynamic programming method can be applied to find the optimum clustering

      faced by data scientists            in various research fields and industry

      a much faster alternative and one that is relevant to biomedical applications.
      In this paper, we            introduce an R package progenyClust that implements
      and extends the original Progeny Clustering            algorithm for evaluating
      clustering stability and identifying the optimal cluster number. We illustrate            its
      applicability using two examples: a simulated test dataset for proof-of-concept,

      in biomedical research. The progenyClust package            is versatile in
      that it offers great flexibility for picking methods and tuning parameters.
      In addition,            the default parameter setting as well as the plot and

    abstract: '  Abstract Reuse of controls from nested case-control designs can increase
      efficiency in many situations,            for instance with competing risks
      or in other multiple endpoints situations. The matching between            cases
      and controls must be broken when controls are to be used for other endpoints.
      A weighted            analysis can then be performed to take care of the biased
      sampling from the cohort. We present the            R package multipleNCC for
      reuse of controls in nested case-control studies by inverse probability            weighting
      of the partial likelihood. The package handles right-censored, left-truncated
      and additionally            matched data, and varying numbers of sampled controls
      and the whole analysis is carried out using            one simple command. Four
      weight estimators are presented and variance estimation is explained.            The
      package is illustrated by analyzing health survey data from three counties in
      Norway for two            causes of death: cardiovascular disease and death
      from alcohol abuse, liver disease, and accidents and            violence. The
      data set is included in the package.'

    abstract: '  Abstract QPot (pronounced kyoo + p ät) is an R package for analyzing
      two-dimensional systems of            stochastic differential equations. It
      provides users with a wide range of tools to simulate, analyze,            and
      visualize the dynamics of these systems. One of QPot’s key features is the computation
      of the            quasi-potential, an important tool for studying stochastic
      systems. Quasi-potentials are particularly            useful for comparing the
      relative stabilities of equilibria in systems with alternative stable states.
      This            paper describes QPot’s primary functions, and explains how quasi-potentials
      can yield insights about            the dynamics of stochastic systems. Three
      worked examples guide users through the application of            QPot’s functions.'

    abstract: '  Abstract Models of cancer progression provide insights on the order
      of accumulation of genetic            alterations during cancer development.
      Algorithms to infer such models from the currently available            mutational
      profiles collected from different cancer patients (cross-sectional data) have
      been defined in            the literature since late the 90s. These algorithms
      differ in the way they extract a graphical model of the            events modelling
      the progression, e.g., somatic mutations or copy-number alterations.                  TRONCO
      is an R package for TRanslational ONcology which provides a series of functions            to
      assist the user in the analysis of cross-sectional genomic data and, in particular,
      it implements            algorithms that aim to model cancer progression by
      means of the notion of selective advantage. These            algorithms are
      proved to outperform the current state-of-the-art in the inference of cancer
      progression            models. TRONCO also provides functionalities to load
      input cross-sectional data, set up the execution            of the algorithms,
      assess the statistical confidence in the results, and visualize the models.            Availability.

    abstract: '  Abstract The package diverse provides an easy-to-use interface to
      calculate and visualize different            aspects of diversity in complex
      systems. In recent years, an increasing number of research projects in            social
      and interdisciplinary sciences, including fields like innovation studies, scientometrics,
      economics,            and network science have emphasized the role of diversification
      and sophistication of socioeconomic            systems. However, so far no dedicated
      package exists that covers the needs of these emerging fields            and
      interdisciplinary teams. Most packages about diversity tend to be created according
      to the            demands and terminology of particular areas of natural and
      biological sciences. The package diverse            uses interdisciplinary concepts
      of diversity—like variety, disparity and balance— as well as ubiquity            and
      revealed comparative advantages, that are relevant to many fields of science,
      but are in particular            useful for interdisciplinary research on diversity
      in socioeconomic systems. The package diverse            provides a toolkit
      for social scientists, interdisciplinary researcher, and beginners in ecology
      to (i)            import data, (ii) calculate different data transformations
      and normalization like revealed comparative            advantages, (iii) calculate
      different diversity measures, and (iv) connect diverse to other specialized
      R            packages on similarity measures, data visualization techniques,
      and statistical significance tests. The            comprehensiveness of the
      package, from matrix import and transformations options, over similarity            and
      diversity measures, to data visualization methods, makes it a useful package
      to explore different            dimensions of diversity in complex systems.'

    abstract: '  Abstract Social scientists and statisticians often use aggregate
      data to predict individual-level behavior            because the latter are
      not always available. Various statistical techniques have been developed to            make
      inferences from one level (e.g., precinct) to another level (e.g., individual
      voter) that minimize            errors associated with ecological inference.
      While ecological inference has been shown to be highly            problematic
      in a wide array of scientific fields, many political scientists and analysis
      employ the            techniques when studying voting patterns. Indeed, federal
      voting rights lawsuits now require such            an analysis, yet expert reports
      are not consistent in which type of ecological inference is used. This            is
      especially the case in the analysis of racially polarized voting when there
      are multiple candidates            and multiple racial groups. The eiCompare
      package was developed to easily assess two of the more            common ecological
      inference methods: EI and EI:R×C. The package facilitates a seamless comparison            between
      these methods so that scholars and legal practitioners can easily assess the
      two methods and            whether they produce similar or disparate findings.'

    abstract: '  Abstract The UK National River Flow Archive (NRFA) stores several
      types of hydrological data and            metadata: daily river flow and catchment
      rainfall time series, gauging station and catchment informa           tion.
      Data are served through the NRFA web services via experimental RESTful APIs.
      Obtaining NRFA            data can be unwieldy due to complexities in handling
      HTTP GET requests and parsing responses in            JSON and XML formats.
      The rnrfa package provides a set of functions to programmatically access,            filter,
      and visualize NRFA data using simple R syntax. This paper describes the structure
      of the rnrfa            package, including examples using the main functions
      gdf() and cmr() for flow and rainfall data,            respectively. Visualization

    landing: '2016'
    abstract: '  Abstract Quantiles play a fundamental role in statistics. The quantile
      function defines the distribution            of a random variable and, thus,
      provides a way to describe the data that is specular but equivalent            to

      many advantages in            working with quantiles, starting from their properties.
      The renewed interest in their usage seen in the            last years is due
      to the theoretical, methodological, and software contributions that have broadened            their

    abstract: '  Abstract In analyzing data deriving from the administration of a
      questionnaire to a group of individu           als, Item Response Theory (IRT)
      models provide a flexible framework to account for several aspects            involved
      in the response process, such as the existence of multiple latent traits. In
      this paper, we focus            on a class of semi-parametric multidimensional
      IRT models, in which these traits are represented            through one or
      more discrete latent variables; these models allow us to cluster individuals
      into homo           geneous latent classes and, at the same time, to properly
      study item characteristics. In particular, we            follow a within-item
      multidimensional formulation similar to that adopted in the two-tier models,            with
      each item measuring one or two latent traits. The proposed class of models may
      be estimated            through the package MLCIRTwithin, whose functioning

      on a two-way contingency table. The main function            that shares the
      same name as the package – CAvariants – allows the user to choose (via a series
      of            input parameters) from six different correspondence analysis procedures.
      These include the classical            approach to (symmetrical) correspondence
      analysis, singly ordered correspondence analysis, doubly            ordered
      correspondence analysis, non symmetrical correspondence analysis, singly ordered
      non            symmetrical correspondence analysis and doubly ordered non symmetrical
      correspondence analysis.            The code provides the flexibility for constructing
      either a classical correspondence plot or a biplot            graphical display.
      It also allows the user to consider other important features that allow to assess
      the            reliability of the graphical representations, such as the inclusion
      of algebraically derived elliptical            confidence regions. This paper

    abstract: '  Abstract In this article the package High-dimensional Metrics hdm
      is introduced. It is a collection of            statistical methods for estimation
      and quantification of uncertainty in high-dimensional approximately            sparse
      models. It focuses on providing confidence intervals and significance testing
      for (possibly many)            low-dimensional subcomponents of the high-dimensional
      parameter vector. Efficient estimators and            uniformly valid confidence
      intervals for regression coefficients on target variables (e.g., treatment or            policy
      variable) in a high-dimensional approximately sparse regression model, for average
      treatment            effect (ATE) and average treatment effect for the treated
      (ATET), as well for extensions of these param           eters to the endogenous
      setting are provided. Theory grounded, data-driven methods for selecting            the
      penalization parameter in Lasso regressions under heteroscedastic and non-Gaussian
      errors are            implemented. Moreover, joint/ simultaneous confidence
      intervals for regression coefficients of a            high-dimensional sparse
      regression are implemented. Data sets which have been used in the literature            and
      might be useful for classroom demonstration and for testing new estimators are
      included.'

    abstract: '  Abstract ROC curve analysis is a fundamental tool for evaluating
      the performance of a marker in a            number of research areas, e.g.,
      biomedicine, bioinformatics, engineering etc., and is frequently used            for
      discriminating cases from controls. There are a number of analysis tools which
      are used to guide            researchers through their analysis. Some of these
      tools are commercial and provide basic methods            for ROC curve analysis
      while others offer advanced analysis techniques and a command-based user            interface,
      such as the R environment. The R environmentg includes comprehensive tools for
      ROC curve            analysis; however, using a command-based interface might
      be challenging and time consuming when a            quick evaluation is desired;
      especially for non-R users, physicians etc. Hence, a quick, comprehensive,            free
      and easy-to-use analysis tool is required. For this purpose, we developed a
      user-friendly web           tool based on the R language. This tool provides
      ROC statistics, graphical tools, optimal cutpoint            calculation, comparison
      of several markers, and sample size estimation to support researchers in their            decisions
      without writing R codes. easyROC can be used via any device with an internet
      connection            independently of the operating system. The web interface
      of easyROC is constructed with the R            package shiny. This tool is
      freely available through www.biosoft.hacettepe.edu.tr/easyROC.'

    abstract: '  Abstract Kernel estimation is an important technique in exploratory
      data analysis. Its utility relies            on its ease of interpretation,
      especially based on graphical means. The Ake package is introduced            for
      univariate density or probability mass function estimation and also for continuous
      and discrete            regression functions using associated kernel estimators.
      These associated kernels have been proposed            due to their specific
      features of variables of interest. The package focuses on associated kernel
      methods            appropriate for continuous (bounded, positive) or discrete
      (count, categorical) data often found in            applied settings. Furthermore,
      optimal bandwidths are selected by cross-validation for any associated            kernel
      and by Bayesian methods for the binomial kernel. Other Bayesian methods for
      selecting            bandwidths with other associated kernels will complete
      this package in its future versions; particularly,            a Bayesian adaptive
      method for gamma kernel estimation of density functions is developed. Some            practical
      and theoretical aspects of the normalizing constant in both density and probability
      mass            functions estimations are given.'

    abstract: '  Abstract The crop water requirement is a key factor in the agricultural
      process. It is usually estimated            throughout actual evapotranspiration
      (ETa ). This parameter is the key to develop irrigation strategies,            to
      improve water use efficiency and to understand hydrological, climatic, and ecosystem
      processes.            Currently, it is calculated with classical methods, which
      are difficult to extrapolate, or with land surface            energy balance
      models (LSEB), such as METRIC and SEBAL, which are based on remote sensing data.            This
      paper describes water, an open implementation of LSEB. The package provides
      several functions            to estimate the parameters of the LSEB equation
      from satellite data and proposes a new object class            to handle weather
      station data. One of the critical steps in METRIC is the selection of “cold”
      and           “hot” pixels, which water solves with an automatic method. The
      water package can process a batch            of satellite images and integrates
      most of the already published sub-models for METRIC. Although            water
      implements METRIC, it will be expandable to SEBAL and others in the near future.
      Finally, two            different procedures are demonstrated using data that
      is included in water package.'

      intervals            over a region of covariate values and/or quantile indices
      for the same functions using analytical            and resampling methods. This

    abstract: ' Abstract The concept of Pareto frontiers is well-known in economics.
      Within the database community           there exist many different solutions
      for the specification and calculation of Pareto frontiers, also called           Skyline
      queries in the database context. Slight generalizations like the combination
      of the Pareto           operator with the lexicographical order have been established
      under the term database preferences. In           this paper we present the
      rPref package which allows to efficiently deal with these concepts within           R.
      With its help, database preferences can be specified in a very similar way as
      in a state-of-the-art           database management system. Our package provides
      algorithms for an efficient calculation of the           Pareto-optimal set

      The procedure uses principal component analysis to            convert multivariate
      observations into a set of linearly uncorrelated statistical measures, which
      are then            compared using a number of statistical methods. This technique
      is independent of the distributional            properties of samples and automatically
      selects features that best explain their differences. The            procedure

    abstract: '  Abstract The WeDiBaDis package provides a user friendly environment
      to perform discriminant            analysis (supervised classification). WeDiBaDis
      is an easy to use package addressed to the biological            and medical
      communities, and in general, to researchers interested in applied studies. It
      can be            suitable when the user is interested in the problem of constructing
      a discriminant rule on the basis            of distances between a relatively
      small number of instances or units of known unbalanced-class            membership
      measured on many (possibly thousands) features of any type. This is a current
      situation            when analyzing genetic biomedical data. This discriminant
      rule can then be used both, as a means of            explaining differences
      among classes, but also in the important task of assigning the class membership            for
      new unlabeled units. Our package implements two discriminant analysis procedures
      in an R            environment: the well-known distance-based discriminant analysis
      (DB-discriminant) and a weighted           distance-based discriminant (WDB-discriminant),
      a novel classifier rule that we introduce. This new            procedure is
      based on an improvement of the DB rule taking into account the statistical depth
      of the            units. This article presents both classifying procedures and
      describes the implementation of each in            detail. We illustrate the
      use of the package using an ecological and a genetic experimental example.            Finally,
      we illustrate the effectiveness of the new proposed procedure (WDB), as compared
      with DB.            This comparison is carried out using thirty-eight, high-dimensional,
      class-unbalanced, cancer data            sets, three of which include clinical
      features.'

      product-limit estimator. Though this estimator has been implemented in several
      R            packages, the development of the condSURV R package has been motivated

      package provides three different approaches all based on the Kaplan-Meier estimator.            In

    abstract: '  Abstract It is common for linear regression models to be plagued
      with the problem of multicollinearity            when two or more regressors
      are highly correlated. This problem results in unstable estimates of            regression
      coefficients and causes some serious problems in validation and interpretation
      of the model.            Different diagnostic measures are used to detect multicollinearity
      among regressors. Many statistical            software and R packages provide
      few diagnostic measures for the judgment of multicollinearity. Most            widely
      used diagnostic measures in these software are: coefficient of determination
      (R2 ), variance            inflation factor/tolerance limit (VIF/TOL), eigenvalues,
      condition number (CN) and condition index            (CI) etc. In this manuscript,
      we present an R package, mctest, that computes popular and widely used            multicollinearity
      diagnostic measures. The package also indicates which regressors may be the
      reason            of collinearity among regressors.'

      and read.chunk are supplied to allow for iteratively loading contiguous            blocks
      of data into memory as raw vectors. These raw vectors can then be efficiently
      converted            into matrices and data frames with the iotools functions
      mstrsplit and dstrsplit. These functions            minimize copying of data

      Finally, we also provide read.csv.raw to allow users to read an entire dataset
      into            memory with the same efficient parsing code. In this paper,
      we present these functions through a            set of examples with an emphasis
      on the flexibility provided by chunk-wise operations. We provide            benchmarks

    abstract: '  Abstract The analysis of transcriptomic experiments with ordered
      covariates, such as dose-response            data, has become a central topic
      in bioinformatics, in particular in omics studies. Consequently,            multiple
      R packages on CRAN and Bioconductor are designed to analyse microarray data
      from various            perspectives under the assumption of order restriction.
      We introduce the new R package IsoGene            Graphical User Interface (IsoGeneGUI),
      an extension of the original IsoGene package that includes            methods
      from most of available R packages designed for the analysis of order restricted
      microarray            data, namely orQA, ORIClust, goric and ORCME. The methods
      included in the new IsoGeneGUI            range from inference and estimation
      to model selection and clustering tools. The IsoGeneGUI is not            only
      the most complete tool for the analysis of order restricted microarray experiments
      available in            R but also it can be used to analyse other types of
      dose-response data. The package provides all the            methods in a user
      friendly fashion, so analyses can be implemented by users with limited knowledge            of
      R programming.'

    abstract: '  Abstract Research on climate change impacts can require extensive
      processing of climate model output,            especially when using ensemble
      techniques to incorporate output from multiple climate models and            multiple
      simulations of each model. This processing can be particularly extensive when
      identifying            and characterizing multi-day extreme events like heat
      waves and frost day spells, as these must be            processed from model

    abstract: '  Abstract Linguistic distance measurements are commonly used in anthropology
      and biology when            quantitative and statistical comparisons between
      words are needed. This is common, for example,            when analyzing linguistic
      and genetic data. Such comparisons can provide insight into historical            population
      patterns and evolutionary processes. However, the most commonly used linguistic            distances
      are derived from edit distances, which do not weight phonetic features that
      may, for            example, represent smaller-scale patterns in linguistic
      evolution. Thus, computational methods for            calculating feature-weighted
      linguistic distances are needed for linguistic, biological, and evolutionary            applications;
      additionally, the linguistic distances presented here are generic and may have
      broader            applications in fields such as text mining and search, as
      well as applications in psycholinguistics            and morphology. To facilitate
      this research, we are making available an open-source R software            package
      that performs feature-weighted linguistic distance calculations. The package
      also includes a            supervised learning methodology that uses a genetic
      algorithm and manually determined alignments            to estimate 13 linguistic
      parameters including feature weights and a skip penalty. Here we present the            package

      the optimal            linguistic parameters for both simulated data and for
      a sample of Austronesian languages. Our results            show that the methodology
      can estimate these parameters for both simulated and real language            data,
      that optimizing feature weights improves alignment accuracy by approximately
      29%, and that            optimization significantly affects the resulting distance
      measurements. Availability: alineR is available            on CRAN.'

      Implementing a Metapopulation Bass Diffusion Model using the

    author: Jim Duggan
    bibauthor: Jim Duggan
    abstract: '  Abstract Diffusion is a fundamental process in physical, biological,
      social and economic settings.            Consumer products often go viral, with
      sales driven by the word of mouth effect, as their adoption            spreads
      through a population. The classic diffusion model used for product adoption
      is the Bass            diffusion model, and this divides a population into two
      groups of people: potential adopters who            are likely to adopt a product,
      and adopters who have purchased the product, and influence others            to
      adopt. The Bass diffusion model is normally captured in an aggregate form, where
      no significant            consumer differences are modeled. This paper extends
      the Bass model to capture a spatial perspective,            using metapopulation
      equations from the field of infectious disease modeling. The paper’s focus is
      on            simulation of deterministic models by solving ordinary differential
      equations, and does not encompass            parameter estimation. The metapopulation
      model in implemented in R using the deSolve package,            and shows the

    abstract: '  Abstract The MDplot package provides plotting functions to allow
      for automated visualisation of            molecular dynamics simulation output.
      It is especially useful in cases where the plot generation is            rather
      tedious due to complex file formats or when a large number of plots are generated.
      The graphs            that are supported range from those which are standard,
      such as RMSD/RMSF (root-mean-square            deviation and root-mean-square
      fluctuation, respectively) to less standard, such as thermodynamic            integration
      analysis and hydrogen bond monitoring over time. All told, they address many
      com           monly used analyses. In this article, we set out the MDplot package’s
      functions, give examples of the            function calls, and show the associated
      plots. Plotting and data parsing is separated in all cases, i.e.            the
      respective functions can be used independently. Thus, data manipulation and
      the integration of            additional file formats is fairly easy. Currently,
      the loading functions support GROMOS, GROMACS,            and AMBER file formats.
      Moreover, we also provide a Bash interface that allows simple embedding of            MDplot
      into Bash scripts as the final analysis step.            Availability: The package
      can be obtained in the latest major version from CRAN (https://cran.r           project.org/package=MDplot)

      On Some Extensions to GA Package: Hybrid Optimisation,
                Parallelisation and Islands Evolution
    author: Luca Scrucca
    bibauthor: Luca Scrucca
    abstract: '  Abstract Genetic algorithms are stochastic iterative algorithms in
      which a population of individuals            evolve by emulating the process
      of biological evolution and natural selection. The R package GA            provides
      a collection of general purpose functions for optimisation using genetic algorithms.
      This            paper describes some enhancements recently introduced in version
      3 of the package. In particular,            hybrid GAs have been implemented
      by including the option to perform local searches during the            evolution.
      This allows to combine the power of genetic algorithms with the speed of a local
      optimiser.            Another major improvement is the provision of facilities
      for parallel computing. Parallelisation has            been implemented using
      both the master-slave approach and the islands evolution model. Several            examples
      of usage are presented, with both real-world data examples and benchmark functions,            showing
      that often high-quality solutions can be obtained more efficiently.'

    abstract: '  Abstract The imputeTS package specializes on univariate time series
      imputation. It offers multiple            state-of-the-art imputation algorithm
      implementations along with plotting functions for time series            missing
      data statistics. While imputation in general is a well-known problem and widely
      covered by R            packages, finding packages able to fill missing values
      in univariate time series is more complicated. The            reason for this
      lies in the fact, that most imputation algorithms rely on inter-attribute correlations,
      while            univariate time series imputation instead needs to employ time
      dependencies. This paper provides an            introduction to the imputeTS
      package and its provided algorithms and tools. Furthermore, it gives a            short
      overview about univariate time series imputation in R.'

    abstract: '  Abstract In Data Mining, the value of extracted knowledge is directly
      related to the quality of the            used data. This makes data preprocessing
      one of the most important steps in the knowledge discovery            process.
      A common problem affecting data quality is the presence of noise. A training
      set with label            noise can reduce the predictive performance of classification
      learning techniques and increase the            overfitting of classification
      models. In this work we present the NoiseFiltersR package. It contains the            first
      extensive R implementation of classical and state-of-the-art label noise filters,
      which are the most            common techniques for preprocessing label noise.
      The algorithms used for the implementation of the            label noise filters
      are appropriately documented and referenced. They can be called in a R-user-friendly            manner,
      and their results are unified by means of the "filter" class, which also benefits
      from adapted            print and summary methods.'

      which implements the sparse            estimation method for Cox proportional
      hazards models via approximated information criterion (Su            et al.,
      2016). The developed methodology is named MIC which stands for “Minimizing approximated            Information
      Criteria". A reparameterization step is introduced to enforce sparsity while
      at the same            time keeping the objective function smooth. As a result,
      MIC is computationally fast with a superior            performance in sparse
      estimation. Furthermore, the reparameterization tactic yields an additional            advantage
      in terms of circumventing post-selection inference (Leeb and Pötscher, 2005).
      The MIC            method and its R implementation are introduced and illustrated
      with the PBC data.'

    abstract: '  Abstract The use of linear and non-linear mixed models in the life
      sciences and pharmacometrics            is common practice. Estimation of the
      parameters of models not involving a system of differential            equations
      is often done by the R or S-Plus software with the nonlinear mixed effects nlme
      package.            The estimated residual error may be used for diagnosis of
      the fitted model, but not whether the            model correctly describes the
      relation between response and included variables including the true            covariance
      structure. The latter is only true if the residual error is known in advance.
      Therefore, it            may be necessary or more appropriate to fix the residual
      error a priori instead of estimate its value.            This can be the case
      if one wants to include evidence from past studies or a theoretical derivation;            e.g.,
      when using a binomial model. S-Plus has an option to fix this residual error
      to a constant, in            contrast to R. For convenience, the nlme package
      was customized to offer this option as well. In this            paper, we derived
      the log-likelihoods for the mixed models using a fixed residual error. By using
      some            well-known examples from mixed models, we demonstrated the equivalence
      of R and S-Plus with            respect to the estimates. The updated package
      has been accepted by the Comprehensive R Archive            Network (CRAN) team
      and will be available at the CRAN website.'

    abstract: '  Abstract In clinical practice, it is very useful to select an optimal
      cutpoint in the scale of a continuous            biomarker or diagnostic test
      for classifying individuals as healthy or diseased. Several methods for            choosing
      optimal cutpoints have been presented in the literature, depending on the ultimate
      goal. One            of these methods, the generalized symmetry point, recently
      introduced, generalizes the symmetry            point by incorporating the misclassification
      costs. Two statistical approaches have been proposed in the            literature
      for estimating this optimal cutpoint and its associated sensitivity and specificity
      measures,            a parametric method based on the generalized pivotal quantity
      and a nonparametric method based            on empirical likelihood. In this
      paper, we introduce GsymPoint, an R package that implements these            methods
      in a user-friendly environment, allowing the end-user to calculate the generalized
      symmetry            point depending on the levels of certain categorical covariates.

    abstract: '  Abstract Heat maps are commonly used to display the spatial distribution
      of a response observed            on a two-dimensional grid. The autoimage package
      provides convenient functions for constructing            multiple heat maps
      in unified, seamless way, particularly when working with projected coordinates.            The
      autoimage package natively supports: 1. automatic inclusion of a color scale
      with the plotted            image, 2. construction of heat maps for responses
      observed on regular or irregular grids, as well as            non-gridded data,
      3. construction of a matrix of heat maps with a common color scale, 4. construction            of
      a matrix of heat maps with individual color scales, 5. projecting coordinates
      before plotting, 6.            easily adding geographic borders, points, and
      other features to the heat maps. After comparing the            autoimage package’s
      capabilities for constructing heat maps to those of existing tools, a carefully            selected

    abstract: '  Abstract This paper introduces the R package that implements the
      Pattern Sequence based Forecasting            (PSF) algorithm, which was developed
      for univariate time series forecasting. This algorithm has been            successfully
      applied to many different fields. The PSF algorithm consists of two major parts:
      clustering            and prediction. The clustering part includes selection
      of the optimum number of clusters. It labels            time series data with
      reference to such clusters. The prediction part includes functions like optimum            window
      size selection for specific patterns and prediction of future values with reference
      to past            pattern sequences. The PSF package consists of various functions
      to implement the PSF algorithm. It            also contains a function which
      automates all other functions to obtain optimized prediction results.            The
      aim of this package is to promote the PSF algorithm and to ease its usage with
      minimum efforts.            This paper describes all the functions in the PSF
      package with their syntax. It also provides a simple            example. Finally,
      the usefulness of this package is discussed by comparing it to auto.arima and

      is providing novel opportunities            for research and citizen science.
      Efficient algorithmic tools are needed to realize the full potential of the            new
      information resources. We introduce the eurostat R package that provides a collection
      of custom            tools for the Eurostat open data service, including functions
      to query, download, manipulate, and            visualize these data sets in
      a smooth, automated and reproducible manner. The online documentation            provides
      detailed examples on the analysis of these spatio-temporal data collections.
      This work            provides substantial improvements over the previously available
      tools, and has been extensively            tested by an active user community.
      The eurostat R package contributes to the growing open source            ecosystem

    bibauthor: Brandon M. Greenwell
    abstract: '  Abstract Complex nonparametric models—like neural networks, random
      forests, and support vector            machines—are more common than ever in
      predictive analytics, especially when dealing with large            observational
      databases that don’t adhere to the strict assumptions imposed by traditional
      statistical            techniques (e.g., multiple linear regression which assumes
      linearity, homoscedasticity, and normality).            Unfortunately, it can
      be challenging to understand the results of such models and explain them to            management.
      Partial dependence plots offer a simple solution. Partial dependence plots are
      low           dimensional graphical renderings of the prediction function so
      that the relationship between the            outcome and predictors of interest
      can be more easily understood. These plots are especially useful in            explaining
      the output from black box models. In this paper, we introduce pdp, a general
      R package            for constructing partial dependence plots.'

    bibtitle: 'checkmate: Fast Argument Checks for Defensive R Programming'
    author: Michel Lang
    bibauthor: Michel Lang
    abstract: '  Abstract Dynamically typed programming languages like R allow programmers
      to write generic,            flexible and concise code and to interact with
      the language using an interactive Read-eval-print-loop            (REPL). However,
      this flexibility has its price: As the R interpreter has no information about
      the            expected variable type, many base functions automatically convert
      the input instead of raising an            exception. Unfortunately, this frequently
      leads to runtime errors deeper down the call stack which            obfuscates
      the original problem and renders debugging challenging. Even worse, unwanted
      conver           sions can remain undetected and skew or invalidate the results
      of a statistical analysis. As a resort,            assertions can be employed
      to detect unexpected input during runtime and to signal understandable            and
      traceable errors. The package checkmate provides a plethora of functions to
      check the type and            related properties of the most frequently used
      R objects and variable types. The package is mostly            written in C
      to avoid any unnecessary performance overhead. Thus, the programmer can conveniently            write
      concise, well-tested assertions which outperforms custom R code for many applications.
      Fur           thermore, checkmate simplifies writing unit tests using the framework
      testthat (Wickham, 2011) by            extending it with plenty of additional
      expectation functions, and registered C routines are available            for
      package developers to perform assertions on arbitrary SEXPs (internal data structure
      for R objects            implemented as struct in C) in compiled code.'

    abstract: '  Abstract The purpose of the milr package is to analyze multiple-instance
      data. Ordinary multiple           instance data consists of many independent
      bags, and each bag is composed of several instances.            The statuses
      of bags and instances are binary. Moreover, the statuses of instances are not
      observed,            whereas the statuses of bags are observed. The functions
      in this package are applicable for analyzing            multiple-instance data,
      simulating data via logistic regression, and selecting important covariates
      in            the regression model. To this end, maximum likelihood estimation
      with an expectation-maximization            algorithm is implemented for model
      estimation, and a lasso penalty added to the likelihood function is            applied
      for variable selection. Additionally, an "milr" object is applicable to generic
      functions fitted,            predict and summary. Simulated data and a real
      example are given to demonstrate the features of this            package.'

    bibauthor: Axel Gandy and Jan Terje Kvaløy
    abstract: '  Abstract In practical applications of control charts the in-control
      state and the corresponding chart            parameters are usually estimated
      based on some past in-control data. The estimation error then            needs
      to be accounted for. In this paper we present an R package, spcadjust, which
      implements a            bootstrap based method for adjusting monitoring schemes
      to take into account the estimation error.            By bootstrapping the past
      data this method guarantees, with a certain probability, a conditional            performance
      of the chart. In spcadjust the method is implement for various types of Shewhart,            CUSUM
      and EWMA charts, various performance criteria, and both parametric and non-parametric            bootstrap
      schemes. In addition to the basic charts, charts based on linear and logistic
      regression            models for risk adjusted monitoring are included, and
      it is easy for the user to add further charts. Use            of the package
      is demonstrated by examples.'

    abstract: '  Abstract Weighted effect coding refers to a specific coding matrix
      to include factor variables in            generalised linear regression models.
      With weighted effect coding, the effect for each category            represents
      the deviation of that category from the weighted mean (which corresponds to
      the sample            mean). This technique has particularly attractive properties
      when analysing observational data, that            commonly are unbalanced.
      The wec package is introduced, that provides functions to apply weighted            effect

    abstract: '  Abstract Data-only packages offer a way to provide extended functionality
      for other R users. However,            such packages can be large enough to
      exceed the package size limit (5 megabytes) for the Comprehen           sive
      R Archive Network (CRAN). As an alternative, large data packages can be posted
      to additional            repostiories beyond CRAN itself in a way that allows
      smaller code packages on CRAN to access and            use the data. The drat
      package facilitates creation and use of such alternative repositories and makes            it
      particularly simple to host them via GitHub. CRAN packages can draw on packages
      posted to drat            repositories through the use of the ‘Additonal_repositories’
      field in the DESCRIPTION file. This paper            describes how R users can
      create a suite of coordinated packages, in which larger data packages are            hosted

      implementations            of MAD exist in C++ and C# to import data, execute
      an ensemble of forward model simulations,            and perform basic post-processing
      of calculating likelihood and posterior distributions for a given            application.
      This article describes the R package anchoredDistr that has been built to provide
      an R           based environment for this method. In particular, anchoredDistr
      provides a range of post-processing            capabilities for MAD software
      by taking advantage of the statistical capabilities and wide use of the            R
      language. Two examples from stochastic hydrogeology are provided to highlight
      the features of            the package for MAD applications in inferring anchored
      distributions of local parameters (e.g. point            values of transmissivity)
      as well as global parameters (e.g. the mean of the spatial random function for            hydraulic
      conductivity).'

    abstract: '  Abstract The dGAselID package proposes an original approach to feature
      selection in high dimen           sional data. The method is built upon a diploid
      genetic algorithm. The genotype to phenotype            mapping is modeled after
      the Incomplete Dominance Inheritance, overpassing the necessity to define            a
      dominance scheme. The fitness evaluation is done by user selectable supervised
      classifiers, from a            broad range of options. Cross validation options
      are also accessible. A new approach to crossover,            inspired from the
      random assortment of chromosomes during meiosis is included. Several mutation            operators,
      inspired from genetics, are also proposed. The package is fully compatible with
      the data            formats used in Bioconductor and MLInterfaces package, readily
      applicable to microarray studies,            but is flexible to other feature
      selection applications from high dimensional data. Several options for            the
      visualization of evolution and outcomes are implemented to facilitate the interpretation
      of results.            The package’s functionality is illustrated by examples.'

    abstract: '  Abstract The alleHap package is designed for imputing genetic missing
      data and reconstruct non           recombinant haplotypes from pedigree databases

      available in a number of linked genetic markers, the program starts by identifying            haplotypes
      compatible with the observed genotypes in those markers without missing values.
      If            haplotypes are identified in parents or offspring, missing alleles
      can be imputed in subjects containing            missing values. Several scenarios
      are analyzed: family completely genotyped, children partially            genotyped
      and parents completely genotyped, children fully genotyped and parents containing            entirely
      or partially missing genotypes, and founders and their offspring both only partially
      genotyped.            The alleHap package also has a function to simulate pedigrees

    abstract: '  Abstract Regression models allow one to isolate the relationship
      between the outcome and an ex           planatory variable while the other variables
      are held constant. Here, we introduce an R package,            visreg, for the
      convenient visualization of this relationship via short, simple function calls.
      In addition            to estimates of this relationship, the package also provides
      pointwise confidence bands and partial            residuals to allow assessment
      of variability as well as outliers and other deviations from modeling            assumptions.
      The package provides several options for visualizing models with interactions,
      including            lattice plots, contour plots, and both static and interactive
      perspective plots. The implementation of            the package is designed
      to be fully object-oriented and interface seamlessly with R’s rich collection
      of            model classes, allowing a consistent interface for visualizing

    abstract: '  Abstract We present the R package fourierin (Basulto-Elias, 2017)
      for evaluating functions defined as            Fourier-type integrals over a
      collection of argument values. The integrals are finitely supported with            integrands
      involving continuous functions of one or two variables. As an important application,
      such            Fourier integrals arise in so-called “inversion formulas”, where
      one seeks to evaluate a probability            density at a series of points
      from a given characteristic function (or vice versa) through Fourier            transforms.
      This paper intends to fill a gap in current R software, where tools for repeated
      evaluation            of functions as Fourier integrals are not directly available.
      We implement two approaches for such            computations with numerical
      integration. In particular, if the argument collection for evaluation            corresponds
      to a regular grid, then an algorithm from Inverarity (2002) may be employed
      based            on a fast Fourier transform, which creates significant improvements
      in the speed over a second            approach to numerical Fourier integration
      (where the latter also applies to cases where the points for            evaluation
      are not on a grid). We illustrate the package with the computation of probability
      densities            and characteristic functions through Fourier integrals/transforms,
      for both univariate and bivariate            examples.'

    abstract: '  Abstract Semi-parametric approaches based on generalized estimating

      longitudinal settings. In this paper, we present a package            CRTgeeDR
      developed for cluster randomized trials with missing data (CRTs). For use of
      inverse            probability weighting to adjust for missing data in cluster

      for non-independence working correlation structure. CRTgeeDR            solves
      this problem. We also extend the ability of existing packages to allow augmented
      Doubly Robust            GEE estimation (DR). Simulation studies demonstrate
      the consistency of estimators implemented in            CRTgeeDR compared to
      packages such as geepack and the gains associated with the use of the DR            for

    abstract: '  Abstract Model-based clustering is a popular technique for grouping
      objects based on a finite mixture            model. It has countless applications
      in different fields of study. The R package ManlyMix implements            the
      Manly mixture model that allows modeling skewness within data groups and performs
      cluster            analysis. ManlyMix is a powerful diagnostics tool that is
      capable of conducting investigation con           cerning the normality of variables
      upon fitting of a Manly forward or backward model. Theoretical            foundations
      as well as description of functions are provided. All features of the package
      are illus           trated with examples in great detail. The analysis of real-life
      datasets demonstrates the flexibility and            usefulness of the package.'

      Whereas new statistical methods            have been added regularly in the
      package since its first release in 2002, the graphical functions, that            are
      used to display the main outputs of an analysis, have not benefited from such
      enhancements. In            this context, the adegraphics package, available

      functionalities but with large improvements. The package uses the S4 object            system

      lattice and            grid. We give a brief description of the package and

      A Tidy Data Model for Natural Language Processing using

    author: Taylor Arnold
    bibauthor: Taylor Arnold
    abstract: '  Abstract Recent advances in natural language processing have produced
      libraries that extract low           level features from a collection of raw
      texts. These features, known as annotations, are usually stored            internally
      in hierarchical, tree-based data structures. This paper proposes a data model
      to represent            annotations as a collection of normalized relational
      data tables optimized for exploratory data analysis            and predictive
      modeling. The R package cleanNLP, which calls one of two state of the art NLP            libraries
      (CoreNLP or spaCy), is presented as an implementation of this data model. It
      takes raw text            as an input and returns a list of normalized tables.
      Specific annotations provided include tokenization,            part of speech
      tagging, named entity recognition, sentiment analysis, dependency parsing, coreference            resolution,
      and word embeddings. The package currently supports input text in English, German,            French,

    abstract: '  Abstract Recently, Mazucheli (2017) uploaded the package mle.tools
      to CRAN. It can be used for            bias corrections of maximum likelihood
      estimates through the methodology proposed by Cox and            Snell (1968).
      The main function of the package, coxsnell.bc(), computes the bias corrected
      maximum            likelihood estimates. Although in general, the bias corrected
      estimators may be expected to have            better sampling properties than
      the uncorrected estimators, analytical expressions from the formula            proposed
      by Cox and Snell (1968) are either tedious or impossible to obtain. The purpose
      of this paper            is twofolded: to introduce the mle.tools package, especially
      the coxsnell.bc() function; secondly, to            compare, for thirty one
      continuous distributions, the bias estimates from the coxsnell.bc() function            and
      the bias estimates from analytical expressions available in the literature.
      We also compare, for            five distributions, the observed and expected
      Fisher information. Our numerical experiments show            that the functions
      are efficient to estimate the biases by the Cox-Snell formula and for calculating
      the            observed and expected Fisher information.'

      This package allows the user to automatically batch process AFM force-distance

      ASCII files and preprocessing the            curves (contact point detection,
      baseline correction. . . ) for finding relevant physical information,            such
      as Young’s modulus, adhesion energies and exponential decay for force relaxation
      and creep            experiments. This package also contains plotting, summary
      and feature extraction functions. The            package also comes with several
      data sets so the user can test the aforementioned features with ease.            The
      package afmToolkit eases the basic processing of large amount of AFM F-d/t curves
      at once. It            is also flexible enough to easily incorporate new functions

    abstract: '  Abstract A new R package is presented for dealing with non-normality
      and variance heterogeneity of            sample data when conducting hypothesis
      tests of main effects and interactions in mixed models. The            proposal
      departs from an existing SAS program which implements Johansen’s general formulation
      of            Welch-James’s statistic with approximate degrees of freedom, which
      makes it suitable for testing any            linear hypothesis concerning cell
      means in univariate and multivariate mixed model designs when            the
      data pose non-normality and non-homogeneous variance. Improved type I error
      rate control is            obtained using bootstrapping for calculating an empirical
      critical value, whereas robustness against            non-normality is achieved
      through trimmed means and Winsorized variances. A wrapper function            eases
      the application of the test in common situations, such as performing omnibus
      tests on all effects            and interactions, pairwise contrasts, and tetrad
      contrasts of two-way interactions. The package is            demonstrated in

    abstract: '  Abstract                Treatment switching in a randomised controlled
      trial occurs when participants change from their            randomised treatment
      to the other trial treatment during the study. Failure to account for treatment            switching
      in the analysis (i.e. by performing a standard intention-to-treat analysis)
      can lead to biased            estimates of treatment efficacy. The rank preserving
      structural failure time model (RPSFTM) is a            method used to adjust
      for treatment switching in trials with survival outcomes. The RPSFTM is due
      to            Robins and Tsiatis (1991) and has been developed by White et al.
      (1997, 1999).                The method is randomisation based and uses only
      the randomised treatment group, observed            event times, and treatment
      history in order to estimate a causal treatment effect. The treatment effect,            ψ,
      is estimated by balancing counter-factual event times (that would be observed
      if no treatment            were received) between treatment groups. G-estimation
      is used to find the value of ψ such that a test            statistic Z (ψ) =
      0. This is usually the test statistic used in the intention-to-treat analysis,
      for example,            the log rank test statistic.                We present
      an R package, rpsftm, that implements the method.'

    abstract: '  Abstract As the number of cyber-attacks continues to grow on a daily
      basis, so does the delay in threat            detection. For instance, in 2015,
      the Office of Personnel Management discovered that approximately            21.5
      million individual records of Federal employees and contractors had been stolen.
      On average,            the time between an attack and its discovery is more
      than 200 days. In the case of the OPM breach,            the attack had been
      going on for almost a year. Currently, cyber analysts inspect numerous potential            incidents
      on a daily basis, but have neither the time nor the resources available to perform
      such a task.            anomalyDetection aims to curtail the time frame in which
      anomalous cyber activities go unnoticed            and to aid in the efficient
      discovery of these anomalous transactions among the millions of daily logged            events
      by i) providing an efficient means for pre-processing and aggregating cyber
      data for analysis            by employing a tabular vector transformation and
      handling multicollinearity concerns; ii) offering            numerous built-in
      multivariate statistical functions such as Mahalanobis distance, factor analysis,            principal
      components analysis to identify anomalous activity, iii) incorporating the pipe
      operator            (%>%) to allow it to work well in the tidyverse workflow.
      Combined, anomalyDetection offers cyber            analysts an efficient and
      simplified approach to break up network events into time-segment blocks            and
      identify periods associated with suspected anomalies for further evaluation.'

    abstract: '  Abstract Requiring no analytical forms, nonparametric discrete patterns
      are flexible in representing            complex relationships among random variables.
      This makes them increasingly useful for data-driven            applications.
      However, there appears to be no software tools for simulating nonparametric
      discrete            patterns, which prevents objective evaluation of statistical
      methods that discover discrete relationships            from data. We present
      a simulator to generate nonparametric discrete functions as contingency tables.            User
      can request strictly many-to-one functional patterns. The simulator can also
      produce contingency            tables representing dependent non-functional
      and independent relationships. An option is provided            to apply random
      noise to contingency tables. We demonstrate the utility of the simulator by
      showing            the advantage of the FunChisq test over Pearson’s chi-square
      test in detecting functional patterns. This            simulator, implemented
      in the function simulate_tables in the R package FunChisq (version 2.4.0 or            greater),
      offers an important means to evaluate the performance of nonparametric statistical
      pattern            discovery methods.'

    abstract: '  Abstract Count data can be analyzed using generalized linear mixed
      models when observations            are correlated in ways that require random
      effects. However, count data are often zero-inflated,            containing
      more zeros than would be expected from the typical error distributions. We present
      a new            package, glmmTMB, and compare it to other R packages that fit
      zero-inflated mixed models. The            glmmTMB package fits many types of
      GLMMs and extensions, including models with continuously            distributed
      responses, but here we focus on count responses. glmmTMB is faster than glmmADMB,            MCMCglmm,
      and brms, and more flexible than INLA and mgcv for zero-inflated modeling. One            unique
      feature of glmmTMB (among packages that fit zero-inflated mixed models) is its
      ability to            estimate the Conway-Maxwell-Poisson distribution parameterized
      by the mean. Overall, its most            appealing features for new users may
      be the combination of speed, flexibility, and its interface’s            similarity
      to lme4.'

    abstract: '  Abstract The R package pltesim calculates and depicts probabilistic
      long-term effects in binary models            with temporal dependence variables.
      The package performs two tasks. First, it calculates the change in            the
      probability of the event occurring given a change in a theoretical variable.
      Second, it calculates the            rolling difference in the future probability
      of the event for two scenarios: one where the event occurred            at a
      given time and one where the event does not occur. The package is consistent
      with the recent            movement to depict meaningful and easy-to-interpret
      quantities of interest with the requisite measures            of uncertainty.
      It is the first to make it easy for researchers to interpret shortand long-term
      effects of            explanatory variables in binary autoregressive models,
      which can have important implications for the            correct interpretation
      of these models.'

    abstract: '  Abstract Integrating R with Geographic Information Systems (GIS)
      extends R’s statistical capabilities            with numerous geoprocessing
      and data handling tools available in a GIS. QGIS is one of the most            popular
      open-source GIS, and it furthermore integrates other GIS programs such as the
      System for            Automated Geoscientific Analyses (SAGA) GIS and the Geographic
      Resources Analysis Support            System (GRASS) GIS within a single software
      environment. This and its QGIS Python API makes            it a perfect candidate
      for console-based geoprocessing. By establishing an interface, the R package            RQGIS
      makes it possible to use QGIS as a geoprocessing workhorse from within R. Compared
      to            other packages building a bridge to GIS (e.g., rgrass7, RSAGA,
      RPyGeo), RQGIS offers a wider            range of geoalgorithms, and is often
      easier to use due to various convenience functions. Finally,            RQGIS
      supports the seamless integration of Python code using reticulate from within
      R for improved            extendability.'

    abstract: '  Abstract Efficiently producing transparent analyses may be difficult
      for beginners or tedious for the            experienced. This implies a need
      for computing systems and environments that can efficiently satisfy            reproducibility
      and accountability standards. To this end, we have developed a system, R package,            and
      R Shiny application called adapr (Accountable Data Analysis Process in R) that
      is built on the            principle of accountable units. An accountable unit
      is a data file (statistic, table or graphic) that            can be associated
      with a provenance, meaning how it was created, when it was created and who            created
      it, and this is similar to the ’verifiable computational results’ (VCR) concept
      proposed by            Gavish and Donoho. Both accountable units and VCRs are
      version controlled, sharable, and can            be incorporated into a collaborative
      project. However, accountable units use file hashes and do not            involve
      watermarking or public repositories like VCRs. Reproducing collaborative work
      may be highly            complex, requiring repeating computations on multiple
      systems from multiple authors; however,            determining the provenance
      of each unit is simpler, requiring only a search using file hashes and            version
      control systems.'

    abstract: '  Abstract We present RealVAMS, an R package for fitting a generalized
      linear mixed model to            multimembership data with partially crossed
      and partially nested random effects. RealVAMS utilizes            a multivariate
      generalized linear mixed model with pseudo-likelihood approximation for fitting            normally
      distributed continuous response(s) jointly with a binary outcome. In an educational
      context,            the model is referred to as a multidimensional value-added
      model, which extends previous theory to            estimate the relationships
      between potential teacher contributions toward different student outcomes            and
      to allow the consideration of a binary, real-world outcome such as graduation.
      The simultaneous            joint modeling of continuous and binary outcomes
      was not available prior to RealVAMS due to            computational difficulties.
      In this paper, we discuss the multidimensional model, describe RealVAMS,            and
      demonstrate the use of this package and its modeling options with an educational
      data set.'

      InfoTrad: An R package for estimating the probability of

    bibauthor: Duygu Çelik and Murat Tiniç
    abstract: '  Abstract The purpose of this paper is to introduce the R package
      InfoTrad for estimating the proba           bility of informed trading (PIN)
      initially proposed by Easley et al. (1996). PIN is a popular information            asymmetry
      measure that proxies the proportion of informed traders in the market. This
      study provides            a short survey on alternative estimation techniques
      for the PIN. There are many problems documented            in the existing literature
      in estimating PIN. InfoTrad package aims to address two problems. First,            the
      sequential trading structure proposed by Easley et al. (1996) and later extended
      by Easley et al.            (2002) is prone to sample selection bias for stocks
      with large trading volumes, due to floating point            exception. This
      problem is solved by different factorizations provided by Easley et al. (2010)
      (EHO            factorization) and Lin and Ke (2011) (LK factorization). Second,
      the estimates are prone to bias due to            boundary solutions. A grid-search
      algorithm (YZ algorithm) is proposed by Yan and Zhang (2012) to            overcome
      the bias introduced due to boundary estimates. In recent years, clustering algorithms
      have            become popular due to their flexibility in quickly handling
      large data sets. Gan et al. (2015) propose            an algorithm (GAN algorithm)
      to estimate PIN using hierarchical agglomerative clustering which is            later
      extended by Ersan and Alici (2016) (EA algorithm). The package InfoTrad offers
      LK and EHO            factorizations given an input matrix and initial parameter
      vector. In addition, these factorizations can            be used to estimate
      PIN through YZ algorithm, GAN algorithm and EA algorithm.'

    title: 'mmpf: Monte-Carlo Methods for Prediction Functions'
    bibtitle: 'mmpf: Monte-Carlo Methods for Prediction Functions'
    author: Zachary M. Jones
    bibauthor: Zachary M. Jones
    abstract: '  Abstract Machine learning methods can often learn high-dimensional
      functions which generalize            well but are not human interpretable.
      The mmpf package marginalizes prediction functions using            Monte-Carlo
      methods, allowing users to investigate the behavior of these learned functions,
      as on a            lower dimensional subset of input features: partial dependence
      and variations thereof. This makes            machine learning methods more
      useful in situations where accurate prediction is not the only goal,            such
      as in the social sciences where linear models are commonly used because of their
      interpretability.                 Many methods for estimating prediction functions
      produce estimated functions which are not            directly human-interpretable
      because of their complexity: for example, they may include high           dimensional
      interactions and/or complex nonlinearities. While a learning method’s capacity
      to            automatically learn interactions and nonlinearities is attractive
      when the goal is prediction, there            are many cases where users want
      good predictions and the ability to understand how predictions            depend
      on the features. mmpf implements general methods for interpreting prediction
      functions            using Monte-Carlo methods. These methods allow any function
      which generates predictions to be be            interpreted. mmpf is currently
      used in other packages for machine learning like edarf and mlr (Jones            and
      Linder, 2016; Bischl et al., 2016).'

    abstract: '  Abstract Data with multiple responses is ubiquitous in modern applications.
      However, few tools are            available for regression analysis of multivariate

      mean-variance structure, limiting its applicability to many data sets. This

    abstract: '  Abstract PanJen is an R-package for ranking transformations in linear
      regressions. It provides users            with the ability to explore the relationship
      between a dependent variable and its independent variables.            The package
      offers an easy and data-driven way to choose a functional form in multiple linear            regression
      models by comparing a range of parametric transformations. The parametric functional            forms
      are benchmarked against each other and a non-parametric transformation. The
      package            allows users to generate plots that show the relation between
      a covariate and the dependent variable.            Furthermore, PanJen will
      enable users to specify specific functional transformations, driven by a            priori
      and theory-based hypotheses. The package supplies both model fits and plots
      that allow users            to make informed choices on the functional forms
      in their regression. We show that the ranking            in PanJen outperforms

      set for            subsequent analyses. An R package FHDI is developed to perform
      FHDI and also the fully efficient            fractional imputation (FEFI) method
      of (Fuller and Kim, 2005) to impute multivariate missing data            with
      arbitrary missing patterns. FHDI substitutes missing items with a few observed
      values jointly            obtained from a set of donors whereas the FEFI uses
      all the possible donors. This paper introduces            FHDI as a tool for
      implementing the multivariate version of fractional hot deck imputation discussed            in
      Im et al. (2015) as well as FEFI. For variance estimation of FHDI and FEFI,
      the Jackknife method is            implemented, and replicated weights are provided
      as a part of the output.'

      engineering, social sciences and so on. In this paper, we present the onewaytests            package
      to investigate treatment effects on the dependent variable. The package offers
      the one-way            tests in independent groups designs, which include ANOVA,
      Welch’s heteroscedastic F test, Welch’s            heteroscedastic F test with
      trimmed means and Winsorized variances, Brown-Forsythe test, Alexander           Govern
      test, James second order test and Kruskal-Wallis test. The package also provides
      pairwise            comparisons, graphical approaches, and assesses variance
      homogeneity and normality of data in each            group via tests and plots.
      A simulation study is also conducted to give recommendations for applied            researchers
      on the selection of appropriate one-way tests under assumption violations. Furthermore,            especially
      for non-R users, a user-friendly web application of the package is provided.

                Problems

    bibauthor: Alejandro Saavedra-Nieves
    abstract: '  Abstract Inventory management of goods is an integral part of logistics
      systems; common to various            economic sectors such as industry, agriculture
      and trade; and independent of production volume. In            general, as companies
      seek to minimize economic losses, studies on problems of multi-agent inventory            have
      increased in recent years. A multi-agent inventory problem is a situation in
      which several            agents face individual inventory problems and agree
      to coordinate their orders with the objective of            reducing their costs.
      The R package Inventorymodel allows the determination of both the optimal            policy
      for some inventory situations with deterministic demands and the allocation
      of costs from a            game-theoretic perspective. The required calculations
      may be computed for any number of agents            although the computational
      complexity of this class of problems when the involved agents enlarge is            not
      reduced. In this work, the different possibilities that the package offers are
      described and some            examples of usage are also demonstrated.'

    abstract: '  Abstract Missing observations are common in time series data and
      several methods are available to            impute these values prior to analysis.
      Variation in statistical characteristics of univariate time series            can
      have a profound effect on characteristics of missing observations and, therefore,
      the accuracy of            different imputation methods. The imputeTestbench
      package can be used to compare the prediction            accuracy of different
      methods as related to the amount and type of missing data for a user-supplied            dataset.
      Missing data are simulated by removing observations completely at random or
      in blocks of            different sizes depending on characteristics of the
      data. Several imputation algorithms are included            with the package
      that vary from simple replacement with means to more complex interpolation            methods.
      The testbench is not limited to the default functions and users can add or remove
      methods            as needed. Plotting functions also allow comparative visualization
      of the behavior and effectiveness of            different algorithms. We present
      example applications that demonstrate how the package can be used            to
      understand differences in prediction accuracy between methods as affected by
      characteristics of a            dataset and the nature of missing data.'

    abstract: '  Abstract Detecting outliers in a multivariate and unsupervised context
      is an important and ongoing            problem notably for quality control.
      Many statistical methods are already implemented in R and            are briefly
      surveyed in the present paper. But only a few lead to the accurate identification
      of            potential outliers in the case of a small level of contamination.
      In this particular context, the Invariant            Coordinate Selection (ICS)
      method shows remarkable properties for identifying outliers that lie on            a
      low-dimensional subspace in its first invariant components. It is implemented
      in the ICSOutlier            package. The main function of the package, ics.outlier,
      offers the possibility of labelling potential            outliers in a completely
      automated way. Four examples, including two real examples in quality control,            illustrate
      the use of the function. Comparing with several other approaches, it appears
      that ICS is            generally as efficient as its competitors and shows an
      advantage in the context of a small proportion of            outliers lying
      in a low-dimensional subspace. In quality control, the method may help in properly            identifying
      some defective products while not detecting too many false positives.'

    abstract: '  Abstract With the proliferation of sensors and the ease of data collection
      from online sources, large            datasets have become the norm in many
      scientific disciplines, and efficient data storage, management,            and
      retrival is imperative for large research projects. Relational databases provide
      a solution, but            in order to be useful, must be able to be linked
      to analysis and visualization tools, such as R. Here,            we present
      a package intended to facilitate integration of R with the open-source database
      software            PostgreSQL, with a focus on its spatial extension, PostGIS.
      The package rpostgis (version 1.4.1)            provides methods for spatial
      data handling (vector and raster) between PostGIS-enabled databases            and
      R, methods for R "data.frame"s storage in PostgreSQL, and a set of convenient
      wrappers for            common database procedures. We thus expect rpostgis
      to be useful for both (1) existing users of            spatial data in R and/or
      PostGIS, and (2) R users who have yet to adopt relational databases for their            projects.'

    abstract: '  Abstract This paper introduces a new algorithm to estimate and perform
      inferences on a recently            proposed and developed semiparametric generalized

      exponential family model, such as the Poisson distribution, this semiparametric            glm
      assumes that the response is drawn from the more general exponential tilt family.
      The regression            coefficients and unspecified reference distribution
      are estimated by maximizing a semiparametric like           lihood. The new
      algorithm incorporates several computational stability and efficiency improvements            over
      the algorithm originally proposed. In particular, the new algorithm performs
      well for either small            or large support for the nonparametric response

    abstract: '  Abstract “Dimensionality reduction” (DR) is a widely used approach
      to find low dimensional and            interpretable representations of data
      that are natively embedded in high-dimensional spaces. DR can be            realized
      by a plethora of methods with different properties, objectives, and, hence,
      (dis)advantages. The            resulting low-dimensional data embeddings are
      often difficult to compare with objective criteria. Here,            we introduce
      the dimRed and coRanking packages for the R language. These open source software            packages
      enable users to easily access multiple classical and advanced DR methods using
      a common            interface. The packages also provide quality indicators
      for the embeddings and easy visualization of            high dimensional data.
      The coRanking package provides the functionality for assessing DR methods            in
      the co-ranking matrix framework. In tandem, these packages allow for uncovering
      complex            structures high dimensional data. Currently 15 DR methods
      are available in the package, some of            which were not previously available
      to R users. Here, we outline the dimRed and coRanking packages            and
      make the implemented methods understandable to the interested reader.'

    abstract: '  Abstract The aim of this study is to construct an epistemic model
      in which each rational choice under            common belief in rationality
      is supplemented by a type which expresses such a belief. In practice, the            finding
      of type depends on manual solution approach with some mathematical operations
      in scope of            the theory. This approach becomes less convenient with
      the growth of the size of the game. To solve            this difficulty, a linear
      programming model is constructed for two-player, static and non-cooperative            games
      to find the type that is supporting that player’s rational choice is optimal
      under common            belief in rationality and maximizing the utility of
      the game. Since the optimal choice would only            be made from rational
      choices, it is first necessary to eliminate all strictly dominated choices.
      In            real life, the games are usually large sized. Therefore, the elimination
      process should be performed            in a computer environment. Since software
      related to game theory was mostly prepared with a            result-oriented
      approach for some types of games, it was necessary to develop software to execute            the
      iterated elimination method. With this regard, a program has been developed
      that determines            the choices that are strictly dominated by pure and
      randomized choices in two-player games. Two            functions named “esdc”
      and “type” are created by using R statistical programming language for the            operations
      performed in both parts, and these functions are added to the content of an
      R package after            its creation with the name EpistemicGameTheory.'

      Advanced Bayesian Multilevel Modeling with the R Package
                brms
    author: Paul-Christian Bürkner
    bibauthor: Paul-Christian Bürkner
    abstract: '  Abstract The brms package allows R users to easily specify a wide
      range of Bayesian single-level            and multilevel models which are fit
      with the probabilistic programming language Stan behind the            scenes.
      Several response distributions are supported, of which all parameters (e.g.,
      location, scale, and            shape) can be predicted. Non-linear relationships
      may be specified using non-linear predictor terms            or semi-parametric
      approaches such as splines or Gaussian processes. Multivariate models can be
      fit            as well. To make all of these modeling options possible in a
      multilevel framework, brms provides an            intuitive and powerful formula
      syntax, which extends the well known formula syntax of lme4. The            purpose
      of the present paper is to introduce this syntax in detail and to demonstrate
      its usefulness            with four examples, each showing relevant aspects
      of the syntax.'

    abstract: '  Abstract This article introduces the R package survivalsvm, implementing
      support vector machines            for survival analysis. Three approaches are
      available in the package: The regression approach takes            censoring
      into account when formulating the inequality constraints of the support vector
      problem.            In the ranking approach, the inequality constraints set
      the objective to maximize the concordance            index for comparable pairs
      of observations. The hybrid approach combines the regression and ranking            constraints
      in a single model. We describe survival support vector machines and their implementation,            provide
      examples and compare the prediction performance with the Cox proportional hazards
      model,            random survival forests and gradient boosting using several

    abstract: '  Abstract Nonparametric tests of independence and k-sample tests are
      ubiquitous in modern applica           tions, but they are typically computationally
      expensive. We present a family of nonparametric tests            that are computationally
      efficient and powerful for detecting any type of dependence between a pair            of
      univariate random variables. The computational complexity of the suggested tests
      is sub-quadratic            in sample size, allowing calculation of test statistics
      for millions of observations. We survey both            algorithms and the HHG
      package in which they are implemented, with usage examples showing            the
      implementation of the proposed tests for both the independence case and the
      k-sample problem.            The tests are compared to existing nonparametric
      tests via several simulation studies comparing both            runtime and power.
      Special focus is given to the design of data structures used in implementation
      of            the tests. These data structures can be useful for developers
      of nonparametric distribution-free tests.'

    author: Timothy Barry
    bibauthor: Timothy Barry
    abstract: '  Abstract R is a powerful tool for data processing, visualization,
      and modeling. However, R is slower            than other languages used for
      similar purposes, such as Python. One reason for this is that R lacks            base
      support for collections, abstract data types that store, manipulate, and return
      data (e.g., sets,            maps, stacks). An exciting recent trend in the
      R extension ecosystem is the development of collection            packages,
      packages that provide classes that implement common collections. At least 12
      collection            packages are available across the two major R extension
      repositories, the Comprehensive R Archive            Network (CRAN) and Bioconductor.
      In this article, we compare collection packages in terms of their            features,
      design philosophy, ease of use, and performance on benchmark tests. We demonstrate
      that,            when used well, the data structures provided by collection
      packages are in many cases significantly            faster than the data structures
      provided by base R. We also highlight current deficiencies among            R
      collection packages and propose avenues of possible improvement. This article
      provides useful            recommendations to R programmers seeking to speed
      up their programs and aims to inform the            development of future collection-oriented
      software for R.'

    abstract: '  Abstract The cchs package contains a function, also called cchs,
      for analyzing data from a stratified            case-cohort study, as used in
      epidemiology. For data from this type of study, cchs calculates Estimator            III

      coefficients in the            Cox proportional hazards model. From the user’s
      point of view, the function is similar to coxph            (in the survival
      package) and other widely used model-fitting functions. Convenient software
      has            not previously been available for Estimator III since it is complicated
      to calculate. SAS and S-Plus            code-fragments for the calculation have

    abstract: '  Abstract This article presents the functionalities of the R package
      SetMethods, aimed at performing            advanced set-theoretic analyses.
      This includes functions for performing set-theoretic multi-method            research,
      set-theoretic theory evaluation, Enhanced Standard Analysis, diagnosing the
      impact of            temporal, spatial, or substantive clusterings of the data
      on the results obtained via Qualitative Com           parative Analysis (QCA),
      indirect calibration, and visualising QCA results via XY plots or radar charts.            Each
      functionality is presented in turn, the conceptual idea and the logic behind
      the procedure being            first summarized, and afterwards illustrated
      with data from Schneider et al. (2010).'

    abstract: '  Abstract High-dimensional longitudinal data pose a serious challenge
      for statistical inference as many            test statistics cannot be computed
      for high-dimensional data, or they do not maintain the nominal            type-I
      error rate, or have very low power. Therefore, it is necessary to derive new
      inference methods            capable of dealing with high dimensionality, and
      to make them available to statistics practitioners.            One such method
      is implemented in the package HRM described in this article. This new method            uses
      a similar approach as the Welch-Satterthwaite t-test approximation and works
      very well for            high-dimensional data as long as the data distribution
      is not too skewed or heavy-tailed. The package            also provides a GUI
      to offer an easy way to apply the methods.'

    bibauthor: Robin Lovelace and Richard Ellison
    abstract: '  Abstract Tools for transport planning should be flexible, scalable,
      and transparent. The stplanr            package demonstrates and provides a
      home for such tools, with an emphasis on spatial transport            data and
      non-motorized modes. The stplanr package facilitates common transport planning
      tasks            including: downloading and cleaning transport datasets; creating
      geographic “desire lines” from            origin-destination (OD) data; route
      assignment, locally and interfaces to routing services such as            CycleStreets.net;
      calculation of route segment attributes such as bearing and aggregate flow;
      and           ‘travel watershed’ analysis. This paper demonstrates this functionality
      using reproducible examples            on real transport datasets. More broadly,
      the experience of developing and using R functions for            transport
      applications shows that open source software can form the basis of a reproducible
      transport            planning workflow. The stplanr package, alongside other
      packages and open source projects, could            provide a more transparent
      and democratically accountable alternative to the current approach, which            is
      heavily reliant on proprietary and relatively inaccessible software.'

    abstract: '  Abstract Learning classification tasks in which each instance is
      associated with one or more labels            are known as multi-label learning.
      The implementation of multi-label algorithms, performed by            different
      researchers, have several specificities, like input/output format, different
      internal functions,            distinct programming language, to mention just
      some of them. As a result, current machine learning            tools include
      only a small subset of multi-label decomposition strategies. The utiml package
      is a            framework for the application of classification algorithms to
      multi-label data. Like the well known            MULAN used with Weka, it provides
      a set of multi-label procedures such as sampling methods,            transformation
      strategies, threshold functions, pre-processing techniques and evaluation metrics.
      The            package was designed to allow users to easily perform complete
      multi-label classification experiments            in the R environment. This
      paper describes the utiml API and illustrates its use in different multi-label            classification
      scenarios.'

    abstract: ' Abstract The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve is a graphical
      method which           has become standard in the analysis of diagnostic markers,
      that is, in the study of the           classification ability of a numerical
      variable. Most of the commercial statistical software           provide routines
      for the standard ROC curve analysis. Of course, there are also many R           packages
      dealing with the ROC estimation as well as other related problems. In this work           we
      introduce the nsROC package which incorporates some new ROC curve procedures.           Particularly:
      ROC curve comparison based on general distances among functions for both           paired
      and unpaired designs; efficient confidence bands construction; a generalization
      of the           curve considering different classification subsets than the
      one involved in the classical defini          tion of the ROC curve; a procedure
      to deal with censored data in cumulative-dynamic ROC           curve estimation
      for time-to-event outcomes; and a non-parametric ROC curve method for           meta-analysis.
      This is the only R package which implements these particular procedures.'

    abstract: '  Abstract The increase in life expectancy followed by the burden of
      chronic diseases contributes to            disability at older ages. The estimation
      of how much chronic conditions contribute to disability can be            useful
      to develop public health strategies to reduce the burden. This paper introduces
      the R package            addhaz, which is based on the attribution method (Nusselder
      and Looman, 2004) to partition disability            into the additive contributions
      of diseases using cross-sectional data. The R package includes tools to            fit
      the additive hazard model, the core of the attribution method, to binary and
      multinomial outcomes.            The models are fitted by maximizing the binomial
      and multinomial log-likelihood functions using            constrained optimization.
      Wald and bootstrap confidence intervals can be obtained for the parameter            estimates.
      Also, the contribution of diseases to the disability prevalence and their bootstrap
      confidence            intervals can be estimated. An additional feature is the
      possibility to use parallel computing to obtain            the bootstrap confidence
      intervals. In this manuscript, we illustrate the use of addhaz with several            examples
      for the binomial and multinomial models, using the data from the Brazilian National
      Health            Survey, 2013.'

    abstract: '  Abstract Complex networks are used to describe a broad range of disparate
      social systems and natural            phenomena, from power grids to customer
      segmentation to human brain connectome. Challenges            of parametric
      model specification and validation inspire a search for more data-driven and
      flexible            nonparametric approaches for inference of complex networks.
      In this paper we discuss methodology            and R implementation of two
      bootstrap procedures on random networks, that is, patchwork bootstrap            of
      Thompson et al. (2016) and Gel et al. (2017) and vertex bootstrap of Snijders
      and Borgatti (1999). To            our knowledge, the new R package snowboot
      is the first implementation of the vertex and patchwork            bootstrap
      inference on networks in R. Our new package is accompanied with a detailed user’s
      manual,            and is compatible with the popular R package on network studies
      igraph. We evaluate the patchwork            bootstrap and vertex bootstrap

    abstract: '  Abstract Sufficient dimension reduction (SDR) turns out to be a useful
      dimension reduction tool in            high-dimensional regression analysis.
      Weisberg (2002) developed the dr-package to implement the            four most
      popular SDR methods. However, the package does not provide any clear guidelines
      as            to which method should be used given a data. Since the four methods
      may provide dramatically            different dimension reduction results, the
      selection in the dr-package is problematic for statistical            practitioners.
      In this paper, a basis-adaptive selection algorithm is developed in order to
      relieve this            issue. The basic idea is to select an SDR method that
      provides the highest correlation between the basis            estimates obtained
      by the four classical SDR methods. A real data example and numerical studies            confirm
      the practical usefulness of the developed algorithm.'

      single function call and are able to build three types of models (SARIMA being
      one of            them). The functions need few inputs and output rich content.
      The output varies according to the            inputs and usually consists of
      a summary of the series properties, step-by-step explanations on how            the
      model was developed, predictions made by the model, and a file containing these
      predictions. This            work focuses on this feature and several other
      BETS functions that are designed to help in modeling            time series.
      We present them in a thorough case study: the SARIMA approach to model and forecast            the
      Brazilian production of intermediate goods index series.'

    abstract: '  Abstract In independent component analysis (ICA) one searches for
      mutually independent non           gaussian latent variables when the components
      of the multivariate data are assumed to be linear            combinations of
      them. Arguably, the most popular method to perform ICA is FastICA. There are            two
      classical versions, the deflation-based FastICA where the components are found
      one by one, and            the symmetric FastICA where the components are found
      simultaneously. These methods have been            implemented previously in
      two R packages, fastICA and ica. We present the R package fICA and            compare
      it to the other packages. Additional features in fICA include optimization of
      the extraction            order in the deflation-based version, possibility
      to use any nonlinearity function, and improvement to            convergence
      of the deflation-based algorithm. The usage of the package is demonstrated by
      applying            it to the real ECG data of a pregnant woman.'

    abstract: '  Abstract Many environmental and geographical models, such as those
      used in land degradation, agro           ecological and climate studies, make
      use of spatially distributed inputs that are known imperfectly.            The
      R package spup provides functions for examining the uncertainty propagation
      from input data            and model parameters onto model outputs via the environmental
      model. The functions include            uncertainty model specification, stochastic
      simulation and propagation of uncertainty using Monte            Carlo (MC)
      techniques. Uncertain variables are described by probability distributions.
      Both numerical            and categorical data types are handled. The package
      also accommodates spatial auto-correlation            within a variable and
      cross-correlation between variables. The MC realizations may be used as input            to
      the environmental models written in or called from R. This article provides
      theoretical background            and three worked examples that guide users

    abstract: '  Abstract Statistically approximating or “emulating” time series model
      output in parameter space is a            common problem in climate science
      and other fields. There are many packages for spatio-temporal            modeling.
      However, they often lack focus on time series, and exhibit statistical complexity.
      Here, we            present the R package stilt designed for simplified AR(1)
      time series Gaussian process emulation,            and provide examples relevant
      to climate modelling. Notably absent is Markov chain Monte Carlo            estimation
      – a challenging concept to many scientists. We keep the number of user choices
      to a            minimum. Hence, the package can be useful pedagogically, while
      still applicable to real life emulation            problems. We provide functions
      for emulator cross-validation, empirical coverage, prediction, as well            as
      response surface plotting. While the examples focus on climate model emulation,
      the emulator is            general and can be also used for kriging spatio-temporal

    abstract: '  Abstract Semi-Markov models, independently introduced by Lévy (1954),
      Smith (1955) and Takacs            (1954), are a generalization of the well-known
      Markov models. For semi-Markov models, sojourn            times can be arbitrarily
      distributed, while sojourn times of Markov models are constrained to be            exponentially
      distributed (in continuous time) or geometrically distributed (in discrete time).
      The aim            of this paper is to present the R package SMM, devoted to
      the simulation and estimation of discrete           time multi-state semi-Markov
      and Markov models. For the semi-Markov case we have considered:            parametric
      and non-parametric estimation; with and without censoring at the beginning and/or
      at the            end of sample paths; one or several independent sample paths.
      Several discrete-time distributions            are considered for the parametric
      estimation of sojourn time distributions of semi-Markov chains:            Uniform,
      Geometric, Poisson, Discrete Weibull and Binomial Negative.'

      for independence are in the base R packages, there have been several recently
      developed            tests for independence that are not available in R. This

    abstract: '  Abstract Herein we present the R package rFSA, which implements an

      a data space for models of a user-specified form that are            statistically
      optimal under a measure of model quality. Many iterations afford a set of feasible
      solutions            (or candidate models) that the researcher can evaluate
      for relevance to his or her questions of interest.            The algorithm
      can be used to formulate new or to improve upon existing models in bioinformatics,            health
      care, and myriad other fields in which the volume of available data has outstripped
      researchers’            practical and computational ability to explore larger

    abstract: '  Abstract The progressive illness-death model is frequently used in
      medical applications. For example,            the model may be used to describe
      the disease process in cancer studies. We have developed a            new R
      package called idmTPreg to estimate regression coefficients in datasets that
      can be described            by the progressive illness-death model. The motivation
      for the development of the package is a            recent contribution that
      enables the estimation of possibly time-varying covariate effects on the            transition
      probabilities for a progressive illness-death data. The main feature of the
      package is that            it befits both non-Markov and Markov progressive
      illness-death data. The package implements the            introduced estimators
      obtained using a direct binomial regression approach. Also, variance estimates            and
      confidence bands are implemented in the package. This article presents guidelines
      for the use of            the package.'

    abstract: '  Abstract The ridge regression estimator, one of the commonly used
      alternatives to the conventional            ordinary least squares estimator,
      avoids the adverse effects in the situations when there exists some            considerable
      degree of multicollinearity among the regressors. There are many software packages            available
      for estimation of ridge regression coefficients. However, most of them display
      limited            methods to estimate the ridge biasing parameters without
      testing procedures. Our developed package,            lmridge can be used to
      estimate ridge coefficients considering a range of different existing biasing            parameters,
      to test these coefficients with more than 25 ridge related statistics, and to
      present different            graphical displays of these statistics.'

    bibauthor: Paul F. Evangelista and David Beskow
    abstract: '  Abstract This paper introduces a spatial point density algorithm
      designed to be explainable, meaning           ful, and efficient. Originally
      designed for military applications, this technique applies to any spatial            point
      process where there is a desire to clearly understand the measurement of density
      and maintain            fidelity of the point locations. Typical spatial density
      plotting algorithms, such as kernel density            estimation, implement
      some type of smoothing function that often results in a density value that is            difficult
      to interpret. The purpose of the visualization method in this paper is to understand
      spatial            point activity density with precision and meaning. The temporal
      tendency of the point process as an            extension of the point density
      methodology is also discussed and displayed. Applications include            visualization
      and measurement of any type of spatial point process. Visualization techniques
      integrate            ggmap with examples from San Diego crime data.'

      Consistency Cubes: a fast, efficient method for exact
                Boolean minimization.
    author: Adrian Dusa
    bibauthor: Adrian Dusa
    abstract: '  Abstract A lot of effort has been spent over the past few decades
      in the QCA methodology field, to            develop efficient Boolean minimization
      algorithms to derive an exact, and more importantly complete            list
      of minimal prime implicants that explain the initial, observed positive configurations.                 As
      the complexity grows exponentially with every new condition, the required computer
      memory            goes past the current computer resources and the polynomial
      time required to solve this problem            quickly grows towards infinity.                 This
      paper introduces a new alternative to the existing non-polynomial attempts.
      It completely            solves the memory problem, and preliminary tests show
      it is exponentially hundreds of time faster            than eQMC, the current
      “best” algorithm for QCA in R, and probes into a territory where it competes            and
      even outperforms engineering algorithms such as Espresso, for exact minimizations.                 While
      speed is not much of an issue now (eQMC is fast enough for simple data), it
      might prove to be            essential when further developing towards all possible
      temporal orders, or searching for configurations            in panel data over
      time, combined with / or automatic detection of difficult counterfactuals etc.'

    bibauthor: David Ardia and Kris Boudt and Leopoldo Catania
    abstract: '  Abstract Financial risk managers routinely use non–linear time series
      models to predict the downside            risk of the capital under management.
      They also need to evaluate the adequacy of their model            using so–called
      backtesting procedures. The latter involve hypothesis testing and evaluation
      of loss            functions. This paper shows how the R package GAS can be
      used for both the dynamic prediction and            the evaluation of downside
      risk. Emphasis is given to the two key financial downside risk measures:            Value-at-Risk
      (VaR) and Expected Shortfall (ES). High-level functions for: (i) prediction,
      (ii) backtesting,            and (iii) model comparison are discussed, and code
      examples are provided. An illustration using the            series of log–returns

      The ability of networks to model complexity has made them the standard approach            for

    abstract: '  Abstract The R package jsr223 is a high-level integration for five
      programming languages in the            Java platform: Groovy, JavaScript, JRuby,
      Jython, and Kotlin. Each of these languages can use Java            objects
      in their own syntax. Hence, jsr223 is also an integration for R and the Java
      platform. It enables            developers to leverage Java solutions from within
      R by embedding code snippets or evaluating script            files. This approach
      is generally easier than rJava’s low-level approach that employs the Java Native            Interface.
      jsr223’s multi-language support is dependent on the Java Scripting API: an implementation            of
      “JSR-223: Scripting for the Java Platform” that defines a framework to embed
      scripts in Java            applications. The jsr223 package also features extensive
      data exchange capabilities and a callback            interface that allows embedded
      scripts to access the current R session. In all, jsr223 makes solutions            developed
      in Java or any of the jsr223-supported languages easier to use in R.'

      of            results, together with a selected R code, and is therefore suitable
      for teaching psychometric concepts            with R. Furthermore, the application
      aspires to be an easy-to-use tool for analysis of educational            tests
      by allowing the users to upload and analyze their own data and to automatically
      generate            analysis reports in PDF or HTML. We argue that psychometric
      analysis should be a routine part of            test development in order to
      gather proofs of reliability and validity of the measurement, and we            demonstrate
      how ShinyItemAnalysis may help enforce this goal.'

    abstract: '  Abstract MessagePack, or MsgPack for short, or when referring to
      the implementation, is an efficient            binary serialization format for
      exchanging data between different programming languages. The            RcppMsgPack
      package provides R with both the MessagePack C++ header files, and the ability
      to            access, create and alter MessagePack objects directly from R.
      The main driver functions of the R            interface are two functions msgpack_pack
      and msgpack_unpack. The function msgpack_pack serializes            R objects
      to a raw MessagePack message. The function msgpack_unpack de-serializes MessagePack            messages
      back into R objects. Several helper functions are available to aid in processing
      and formatting            data including msgpack_simplify, msgpack_format and
      msgpack_map.'

      BNSP: an R Package for Fitting Bayesian Semiparametric
                Regression Models and Variable Selection
    author: Georgios Papageorgiou
    bibauthor: Georgios Papageorgiou
    abstract: '  Abstract The R package BNSP provides a unified framework for semiparametric
      location-scale            regression and stochastic search variable selection.
      The statistical methodology that the package is            built upon utilizes
      basis function expansions to represent semiparametric covariate effects in the
      mean            and variance functions, and spike-slab priors to perform selection
      and regularization of the estimated            effects. In addition to the main
      function that performs posterior sampling, the package includes            functions
      for assessing convergence of the sampler, summarizing model fits, visualizing
      covariate            effects and obtaining predictions for new responses or
      their means given feature/covariate vectors.'

    abstract: '  Abstract This paper presents an R package to handle and represent
      measurements with errors in a            very simple way. We briefly introduce
      the main concepts of metrology and propagation of uncertainty,            and
      discuss related R packages. Building upon this, we introduce the errors package,
      which provides            a class for associating uncertainty metadata, automated
      propagation and reporting. Working with            errors enables transparent,
      lightweight, less error-prone handling and convenient representation            of
      measurements with errors. Finally, we discuss the advantages, limitations and
      future work of            computing with errors.'

    bibauthor: Julia Silge and John C. Nash and Spencer Graves
    abstract: '  Abstract Today, the enormous number of contributed packages available
      to R users outstrips any given            user’s ability to understand how these
      packages work, their relative merits, or how they are related            to
      each other. We organized a plenary session at useR!2017 in Brussels for the
      R community to think            through these issues and ways forward. This
      session considered three key points of discussion. Users            can navigate
      the universe of R packages with (1) capabilities for directly searching for
      R packages, (2)            guidance for which packages to use, e.g., from CRAN
      Task Views and other sources, and (3) access to            common interfaces
      for alternative approaches to essentially the same problem.'
