sequences from the Protein Data Bank (PDB) by sequence identity and 
structural quality criteria. PISCES can provide lists culled from the entire 
PDB or from lists of PDB entries or chains provided by the user. The 
sequence identities are obtained from PSI-BLAST alignments with 
position-specific substitution matrices derived from the non-redundant 
protein sequence database. PISCES therefore provides better lists than 
servers that use BLAST, which is unable to identify many relationships below 
40\\% sequence identity and often overestimates sequence identity by 
aligning only well-conserved fragments. PDB sequences are updated weekly. 
PISCES can also cull non-PDB sequences provided by the user as a list of 
GenBank identifiers, a FASTA format file, or BLAST/PSI-BLAST output. Availability: The server is located at http://www.fccc.edu/research/labs/dunbrack/piscesContact: rl\_dunbrack@fccc.edu*To whom correspondence
