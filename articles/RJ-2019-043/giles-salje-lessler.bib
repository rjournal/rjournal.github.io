	abstract = {Estimating transmission chains for dengue
Dengue virus ({DENV}) causes a large number of asymptomatic infections, so surveillance captures only a fraction of cases. Salje et al. developed a method for identifying the number of transmission chains of {DENV} from sequence data and serology. They found that sequential transmission of {DENV} typically occurs between households in the same neighborhood. Within high-density urban localities, such as Bangkok, there are surprisingly few transmission chains. This results in epidemic spikes within a regional background of endemicity. Large urban settings may thus act as a source of diverse viruses that can be transported elsewhere.
Science, this issue p. 1302
A fundamental mystery for dengue and other infectious pathogens is how observed patterns of cases relate to actual chains of individual transmission events. These pathways are intimately tied to the mechanisms by which strains interact and compete across spatial scales. Phylogeographic methods have been used to characterize pathogen dispersal at global and regional scales but have yielded few insights into the local spatiotemporal structure of endemic transmission. Using geolocated genotype (800 cases) and serotype (17,291 cases) data, we show that in Bangkok, Thailand, 60\% of dengue cases living {\textless}200 meters apart come from the same transmission chain, as opposed to 3\% of cases separated by 1 to 5 kilometers. At distances {\textless}200 meters from a case (encompassing an average of 1300 people in Bangkok), the effective number of chains is 1.7. This number rises by a factor of 7 for each 10-fold increase in the population of the “enclosed” region. This trend is observed regardless of whether population density or area increases, though increases in density over 7000 people per square kilometer do not lead to additional chains. Within Thailand these chains quickly mix, and by the next dengue season viral lineages are no longer highly spatially structured within the country. In contrast, viral flow to neighboring countries is limited. These findings are consistent with local, density-dependent transmission and implicate densely populated communities as key sources of viral diversity, with home location the focal point of transmission. These findings have important implications for targeted vector control and active surveillance.
Regions of high human population density drive highly localized transmission chains of dengue virus, which then can disperse regionally.

Here we analyzed age-specific data from 2 serological studies (from 1973 and 2012) in Cebu, Philippines, to reconstruct both the annual probability of infection and population-level immunity over a 60-year period (1952–2012). We also explored whether seroconversions during 2012–2013 were spatially clustered. Our models identified 4 discrete outbreaks separated by an average delay of 17 years. On average, 23\% (95\% confidence interval [{CI}], 16\%–37\%) of the susceptible population was infected per outbreak, with \&gt;50\% of the entire population remaining susceptible at any point. Participants who seroconverted during 2012–2013 were clustered at distances of \&lt;230 m, suggesting focal transmission. Large-scale outbreaks of chikungunya did not result in sustained multiyear transmission. Nevertheless, we estimate that \&gt;350 000 infections were missed by surveillance systems.

	abstract = {Author Summary All four serotypes of dengue have circulated endemically throughout Southeast Asia for decades. However, despite the enormous burden of disease, there remains poor understanding of the similarity in disease patterns across the region. We analyzed data from over 100,000 cases of dengue from two of the largest cities in the region, Bangkok and Ho Chi Minh City between 2001 and 2009. We use basic statistical methods to reconstruct the annual probability of infection in the two cities during this time period using methods that are robust to differences in reporting mechanisms. We find that both the epidemic curves and annual probabilities of infection were highly correlated across the cities, however, serotype-specific correlations were far more variable. Finally, we used geocoded case homes from Ho Chi Minh to demonstrate that cases in the city clustered at spatial scales ({\textless}500m) similar to that previously observed in Bangkok. These findings show that dengue dynamics are highly comparable across these two urban hubs; however, the low correlation in serotype distribution suggests that similar built environments and climate, rather than viral flow drives these observations.},

	abstract = {Background Cholera prevention and control interventions targeted to neighbors of cholera cases (case-area targeted interventions [{CATIs}]), including improved water, sanitation, and hygiene, oral cholera vaccine ({OCV}), and prophylactic antibiotics, may be able to efficiently avert cholera cases and deaths while saving scarce resources during epidemics. Efforts to quickly target interventions to neighbors of cases have been made in recent outbreaks, but little empirical evidence related to the effectiveness, efficiency, or ideal design of this approach exists. Here, we aim to provide practical guidance on how {CATIs} might be used by exploring key determinants of intervention impact, including the mix of interventions, “ring” size, and timing, in simulated cholera epidemics fit to data from an urban cholera epidemic in Africa. Methods and findings We developed a micro-simulation model and calibrated it to both the epidemic curve and the small-scale spatiotemporal clustering pattern of case households from a large 2011 cholera outbreak in N’Djamena, Chad (4,352 reported cases over 232 days), and explored the potential impact of {CATIs} in simulated epidemics. {CATIs} were implemented with realistic logistical delays after cases presented for care using different combinations of prophylactic antibiotics, {OCV}, and/or point-of-use water treatment ({POUWT}) starting at different points during the epidemics and targeting rings of various radii around incident case households. Our findings suggest that {CATIs} shorten the duration of epidemics and are more resource-efficient than mass campaigns. {OCV} was predicted to be the most effective single intervention, followed by {POUWT} and antibiotics. {CATIs} with {OCV} started early in an epidemic focusing on a 100-m radius around case households were estimated to shorten epidemics by 68\% ({IQR} 62\% to 72\%), with an 81\% ({IQR} 69\% to 87\%) reduction in cases compared to uncontrolled epidemics. These same targeted interventions with {OCV} led to a 44-fold ({IQR} 27 to 78) reduction in the number of people needed to target to avert a single case of cholera, compared to mass campaigns in high-cholera-risk neighborhoods. The optimal radius to target around incident case households differed by intervention type, with antibiotics having an optimal radius of 30 m to 45 m compared to 70 m to 100 m for {OCV} and {POUWT}. Adding {POUWT} or antibiotics to {OCV} provided only marginal impact and efficiency improvements. Starting {CATIs} early in an epidemic with {OCV} and {POUWT} targeting those within 100 m of an incident case household reduced epidemic durations by 70\% ({IQR} 65\% to 75\%) and the number of cases by 82\% ({IQR} 71\% to 88\%) compared to uncontrolled epidemics. {CATIs} used late in epidemics, even after the peak, were estimated to avert relatively few cases but substantially reduced the number of epidemic days (e.g., by 28\% [{IQR} 15\% to 45\%] for {OCV} in a 100-m radius). While this study is based on a rigorous, data-driven approach, the relatively high uncertainty about the ways in which {POUWT} and antibiotic interventions reduce cholera risk, as well as the heterogeneity in outbreak dynamics from place to place, limits the precision and generalizability of our quantitative estimates. Conclusions In this study, we found that {CATIs} using {OCV}, antibiotics, and water treatment interventions at an appropriate radius around cases could be an effective and efficient way to fight cholera epidemics. They can provide a complementary and efficient approach to mass intervention campaigns and may prove particularly useful during the initial phase of an outbreak, when there are few cases and few available resources, or in order to shorten the often protracted tails of cholera epidemics.},

In this paper, we explain the principles of Monte Carlo tests and their correct interpretation, canvas the beneﬁts of graphical procedures, measure the statistical performance of several popular tests, and make practical recommendations. There are several caveats including the under-recognized problem that Monte Carlo tests of goodness of ﬁt are probably conservative if the model parameters have to be estimated from data.

In previous editions of this text, my rhetoric was somewhat tentative. I was saying, in e?ect, “Gee guys, permutation methods provide a practical real-world alternative to asymptotic parametric approximations. Why not give them a try?” But today, the theory, the software, and the hardware have come together. Distribution-free permutation procedures are the primary method for testing hypotheses. Parametric procedures and the bootstrap are to be reserved for the few situations in which they may be applicable. Four factors have forced this change: 1. Desire by workers in applied ?elds to use the most powerful statistic for their applications. Such workers may not be aware of the fundamental lemma of Neyman and Pearson, but they know that the statistic they wanttouse—acomplexscoreoraratioofscores,doesnothaveanalready well-tabulated distribution. 2. Pressure from regulatory agencies for the use of methods that yield exact signi?cance levels, not approximations. 3. A growing recognition that most real-world data are drawn from mixtures of populations. 4. A growing recognition that missing data is inevitable, balanced designs the exception. Thus, it seems natural that the theory of testing hypothesis and the more general decision theory in which it is embedded should be introduced via the permutation tests. On the other hand, certain relatively robust param- ric tests such as Student’s t continue to play an essential role in statistical practice.},

	abstract = {The estimation of kernel-smoothed relative risk functions is a useful approach to examining the spatial variation of disease risk. Though there exist several options for performing kernel density estimation in statistical software packages, there have been very few contributions to date that have focused on estimation of a relative risk function per se. Use of a variable or adaptive smoothing parameter for estimation of the individual densities has been shown to provide additional beneï¬ts in estimating relative risk and speciï¬c computational tools for this approach are essentially absent. Furthermore, little attention has been given to providing methods in available software for any kind of subsequent analysis with respect to an estimated risk function. To facilitate analyses in the ï¬eld, the R package sparr is introduced, providing the ability to construct both ï¬xed and adaptive kernel-smoothed densities and risk functions, identify statistically signiï¬cant ï¬uctuations in an estimated risk function through the use of asymptotic tolerance contours, and visualize these objects in ï¬exible and attractive ways.},
