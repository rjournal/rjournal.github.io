  abstract =	 {We propose Ordered Subspace Clustering (OSC) to
                  seg-ment data drawn from a sequentially ordered
                  union of sub-spaces. Current subspace clustering
                  techniques learn the relationships within a set of
                  data and then use a separate clustering algorithm
                  such as NCut for final segmentation. In contrast our
                  technique, under certain conditions, is ca-pable of
                  segmenting clusters intrinsically without providing
                  the number of clusters as a parameter. Similar to
                  Sparse Subspace Clustering (SSC) we formulate the
                  problem as one of finding a sparse representation
                  but include a new penalty term to take care of
                  sequential data. We test our method on data drawn
                  from infrared hyper spectral data, video sequences
                  and face images. Our experiments show that our
                  method, OSC, outperforms the state of the art
                  meth-ods: Spatial Subspace Clustering (SpatSC),
                  Low-Rank Rep-resentation (LRR) and SSC.},
