\maketitle

\abstract{%
We introduce the R package SIHR for statistical inference in
high-dimensional generalized linear models with continuous and binary
outcomes. The package provides functionalities for constructing
confidence intervals and performing hypothesis tests for
low-dimensional objectives in both one-sample and two-sample
regression settings. We illustrate the usage of SIHR through simulated
examples and present real data applications to demonstrate the
package's performance and practicality.
