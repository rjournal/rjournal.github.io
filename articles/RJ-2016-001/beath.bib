                  also well developed, but are little applied due to
                  combinatorial problems. But sometimes the pattern of
                  multiple outliers cannot be revealed by single
                  deletion methods. In such cases ‘masking’ is said to
                  occur. The method of unmasking described in the
                  paper uses samples of elemental sets of the
                  observations to fit least median of squares
                  regression to the data. This robust method has high
                  resistance and serves as an exploratory tool for the
                  identification of outliers. The techniques of
                  multiple deletion regression diagnostics are then
                  directly applicable for confirmation of the presence
                  of outliers and influential observations.},

@article{Kontopantelis2012a,
  abstract =	 {Meta-analysis (MA) is a statistical methodology that
                  combines the results of several independent studies
                  considered by the analyst to be 'combinable'. The
                  simplest approach, the fixed-effects (FE) model,
                  assumes the true effect to be the same in all
                  studies, while the random-effects (RE) family of
                  models allows the true effect to vary across
                  studies. However, all methods are only correct
                  asymptotically, while some RE models assume that the
                  true effects are normally distributed. In practice,
                  MA methods are frequently applied when study numbers
                  are small and the normality of the effect
                  distribution unknown or unlikely. In this article,
                  we discuss the performance of the FE approach and
                  seven frequentist RE MA methods: DerSimonian-Laird,
                  Q-based, maximum likelihood, profile likelihood,
                  Biggerstaff-Tweedie, Sidik-Jonkman and
                  Follmann-Proschan. We covered numerous scenarios by
                  varying the MA sizes (small to moderate), the degree
                  of heterogeneity (zero to very large) and the
                  distribution of the effect sizes (normal,
                  skew-normal and 'extremely' non-normal). Performance
                  was evaluated in terms of coverage (Type I error),
                  power (Type II error) and overall effect estimation
                  (accuracy of point estimates and error intervals).},

  Abstract =	 {Meta-analysis typically involves combining the
                  estimates from independent studies in order to
                  estimate a parameter of interest across a population
                  of studies. However, outliers often occur even under

                  outliers could substantially alter the conclusions
                  in a meta-analysis. This paper proposes a
                  methodology for identifying and, if desired,
                  downweighting studies that do not appear

@article{Higgins2002a,
  Abstract =	 {BACKGROUND: There has been extensive discussion of
                  the apparent conflict between meta-analyses and a
                  mega-trial investigating the benefits of intravenous
                  magnesium following myocardial infarction, in which
                  the early trial results have been said to be 'too
                  good to be true'.  METHODS: We apply Bayesian
                  methods of meta-analysis to the trials available
                  before and after the publication of the ISIS-4
                  results. We show how scepticism can be formally
                  incorporated into an analysis as a Bayesian prior
                  distribution, and how Bayesian meta-analysis models
                  allow appropriate exploration of hypotheses that the
                  treatment effect depends on the size of the trial or
                  the risk in the control group.  RESULTS: Adoption of
                  a sceptical prior would have led early enthusiasm
                  for magnesium to be suitably tempered, but only if
                  combined with a random effects meta-analysis, rather
                  than the fixed effect analysis that was actually
                  conducted.  CONCLUSIONS: We argue that neither a
                  fixed effect nor a random effects analysis is
                  appropriate when the mega-trial is included. The
                  Bayesian framework provides many possibilities for
                  flexible exploration of clinical hypotheses, but
                  there can be considerable sensitivity to apparently
                  innocuous assumptions.},
