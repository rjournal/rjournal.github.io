	Abstract = {{To better define the molecular basis of multiple myeloma (MM), we performed unsupervised hierarchic clustering of mRNA expression profiles in CD138-enriched plasma cells from 414 newly diagnosed patients who went on to receive high-dose therapy and tandem stem cell transplants. Seven disease subtypes were validated that were strongly influenced by known genetic lesions, such as c-MAF-- and MAFB-, CCND1- and CCND3-, and MMSET-activating translocations and hyperdiploidy. Indicative of the deregulation of common pathways by gene orthologs, common gene signatures were observed in cases with c-MAF and MAFB activation and CCND1 and CCND3 activation, the latter consisting of 2 subgroups, one characterized by expression of the early B-cell markers CD20 and PAX5. A low incidence of focal bone disease distinguished one and increased expression of proliferation-associated genes of another novel subgroup. Comprising varying fractions of each of the other 6 subgroups, the proliferation subgroup dominated at relapse, suggesting that this signature is linked to disease progression. Proliferation and MMSET-spike groups were characterized by significant overexpression of genes mapping to chromosome 1q, and both exhibited a poor prognosis relative to the other groups. A subset of cases with a predominating myeloid gene expression signature, excluded from the profiling analyses, had more favorable baseline characteristics and superior prognosis to those lacking this signature.}},

@article{neumeyer03,
	Abstract = {We propose a new test for the comparison of two regression curves that is based on a difference of two marked empirical processes based on residuals. The large sample behavior of the corresponding statistic is studied to provide a full nonparametric comparison of regression curves. In contrast to most procedures suggested in the literature, the new procedure is applicable in the case of different design points and heteroscedasticity. Moreover, it is demonstrated that the proposed test detects continuous alternatives converging to the null at a rate N-1/2 and that, in contrast to all other available procedures based on marked empirical processes, the new test allows the optimal choice of bandwidths for curve estimation (e.g., N-l/5 in the case of twice differentiable regression functions). As a by-product we explain the problems of a related test proposed by Kulasekera [J. Amer. Statist. Assoc. 90 (1995) 1085-1093] and Kulasekera and Wang [J. Amer. Statist. Assoc. 92 (1997) 500-511] with respect to accuracy in the approximation of the level. These difficulties mainly originate from the comparison with the quantiles of an inappropriate limit distribution. A simulation study is conducted to investigate the finite sample properties of a wild bootstrap version of the new test and to compare it with the so far available procedures. Finally, heteroscedastic data is analyzed in order to demonstrate the benefits of the new test compared to the so far available procedures which require homoscedasticity.},

	Abstract = {Assume that (X-j, Y-j) are independent random vectors satisfying the nonparametric regression models Y-j = m(j) (X-j) + sigma(j) (X-j)epsilon(j), for j = 1, ... , k, where mj (X-j) = E(Y-j | X-j) and sigma(2)(j)(X-j) = Var (Y-j | X-j) are smooth but unknown regression and variance functions respectively, and the error variable epsilon(j) is independent of X-j. In this article we introduce a procedure to test the hypothesis of equality of the k regression functions. The test is based on the comparison of two estimators of the distribution of the errors in each population. Kolmogorov-Smirnov and Cramer-von Mises type statistics are considered, and their asymptotic distributions are obtained. The proposed tests can detect local alternatives converging to the null hypothesis at the rate n(-1/2). We describe a bootstrap procedure that approximates the critical values, and present the results of a simulation study in which the behavior of the tests for small and moderate sample sizes is studied. Finally, we include an application to a data set.},

Three tests are proposed that are free of the restriction of having the same covariate values or sample sizes for both samples. Asymptotic distributions are given and results from a simulation study are presented that show the superior power properties of these tests over a competing test in a variety of cases, including the testing of hypotheses involving high-frequency curves when the design points for the two samples differ. It is also observed that the tests have good level properties when proper smoothing parameters are selected.},

@article{10.2307/2289169,
	Abstract = {Considerable progress has been made in generalizing to censored data hypothesis tests based on rank statistics. The most commonly used generalizations are the log-rank test statistic, which extends the Savage exponential scores statistic (Cox 1972; Mantel 1966) and the generalized Wilcoxon statistics (Gehan 1965; Peto and Peto 1972). Gill (1980) showed that in the two-sample problem the asymptotic efficiency properties of the Savage and Wilcoxon statistics are maintained in censored data by the log-rank and Peto and Peto Wilcoxon statistics, respectively, when censoring is the same in both samples. Heuristics and simulations have implied that some recently proposed supremum statistics, closely related to these two popular linear rank statistics, can be used to construct tests that provide good power against a much wider range of nonlocal alternatives (see, e.g., Fleming and Harrington 1981; Fleming, O'Brien, O'Fallon, and Harrington 1980; Gill 1980; Schumacher 1984). In this article we consider new and previously discussed classes of rank statistics that are related to the log-rank and generalized Wilcoxon tests. We focus on linear rank statistics and their Renyi-type supremum versions. These classes are either of the "asymptotically fully efficient" type or the "approximately distribution-free" type discussed by Leurgans (1983). The large sample distributions of these statistics are established for the general setting in which ties can be present in the data. By restricting attention to the general random censorship model, we obtain the asymptotic results by stating and applying a simplified version of Gill's (1980) limit theorems. We examine more thoroughly than in previous literature the relative operating characteristics of these newly and previously proposed censored data rank statistics. Important insights are obtained from simulations performed for small and moderate sample sizes, in equal and unequal sample sizes, and across a range of survival differences and degrees of censorship. For example, results reveal that supremum versions of the log-rank statistic are nearly as sensitive to proportional-hazards alternatives as the efficient log-rank test. In addition, these supremum versions provide greater sensitivity across a wide range of nonproportional-hazards configurations. This increase in power from the supremum statistics is less evident, however, when data are so heavily censored that one can only estimate early survival differences. Another important insight is obtained from the comparison in small samples of asymptotically fully efficient versus approximately distribution-free statistics. Although the former class has received much greater attention, the latter has the desirable property that the types of survival differences detected with highest power are less affected by degree of censorship. In certain circumstances, it would be appealing to apply simultaneously a linear rank statistic and its supremum version. Distributional results are obtained to show how this can be done appropriately and in a very straightforward manner.},

	Abstract = {A distribution-free two-sample test is proposed that is an extension of the Wilcoxon test to samples with arbitrary censoring on the right. The test is conditional on the pattern of observations. The null hypothesis is $$H_0: F_1(t) = F_2(t) (t \leqslant T) \text{against either}\\ H_1: F_1(t) < F_2(t) (t \leqslant T) \text{or}\\ H_2: F_1(t) < F_2(t) \text{or} F_1(t) > F_2(t) (t \leqslant T)$$, where $F_1, F_2$ are cumulative distributions (discrete or continuous) of the observations and $T$ is their upper limit. The test is shown to be asymptotically normal and consistent against one-sided alternatives $F_1(t) < F_2(t) (t \leqslant T)$ and against two-sided alternatives where either $F_1(t) < F_2(t)$ or $F_1(t) > F_2(t) (t \leqslant T)$. The asymptotic efficiency of the test relative to the efficient parametric test when the distributions are exponential is at least 0.75 and increases with degree of censoring. When $H_0$ is true, the test is not seriously affected by real differences in the percentage censored in the two groups. Some comparisons are made for five cases of varying degrees of censoring and tying between probabilities from the exact test and those from the proposed test and these suggest the test is appropriate under certain conditions when the sample size is five in each group. A worked example is presented and some discussion is given to further problems.},

	Abstract = {Item response theory (IRT) models are a class of statistical models used to describe the response behaviors of individuals to a set of items having a certain number of options. They are adopted by researchers in social science, particularly in the analysis of performance or attitudinal data, in psychology, education, medicine, marketing and other fields where the aim is to measure latent constructs. Most IRT analyses use parametric models that rely on assumptions that often are not satisfied. In such cases, a nonparametric approach might be preferable; nevertheless, there are not many software implementations allowing to use that.

To address this gap, this paper presents the R  package KernSmoothIRT . It implements kernel smoothing for the estimation of option characteristic curves, and adds several plotting and analytical tools to evaluate the whole test/questionnaire, the items, and the subjects. In order to show the package's capabilities, two real datasets are used, one employing multiple-choice responses, and the other scaled responses.},

	Abstract = {We introduce the R package DBKGrad, conceived to facilitate the use of kernel smoothing in graduating mortality rates. The package implements univariate and bivariate adaptive discrete beta kernel estimators. Discrete kernels have been preferred because, in this context, variables such as age, calendar year and duration, are pragmatically considered as discrete and the use of beta kernels is motivated since it reduces boundary bias. Furthermore, when data on exposures to the risk of death are available, the use of adaptive bandwidth, that may be selected by cross-validation, can provide additional benefits. To exemplify the use of the package, an application to Italian mortality rates, for different ages and calendar years, is presented. },

	Abstract = { In this paper we propose a test for the significance of categorical predictors in nonparametric regression models. The test is fully data-driven and employs cross-validated smoothing parameter selection while the null distribution of the test is obtained via bootstrapping. The proposed approach allows applied researchers to test hypotheses concerning categorical variables in a fully nonparametric and robust framework, thereby deflecting potential criticism that a particular finding is driven by an arbitrary parametric specification. Simulations reveal that the test performs well, having significantly better power than a conventional frequency-based nonparametric test. The test is applied to determine whether OECD and non-OECD countries follow the same growth rate model or not. Our test suggests that OECD and non-OECD countries follow different growth rate models, while the tests based on a popular parametric specification and the conventional frequency-based nonparametric estimation method fail to detect any significant difference. },

	Abstract = {Abstract The selection of spawning habitat of a population of Octopus vulgaris that is subject to a small-scale exploitation was studied in the C{\'\i}es Islands within the National Park of the Atlantic Islands of Galicia (NW Spain). The technique used was visual censuses by scuba diving. We conducted 93 visual censuses from April 2012 to April 2014. The total swept area was 123.69 ha. Habitat features (season, depth, zone, bottom temperature, swept area, bottom substrate type, and creels fishing impact) were evaluated as predictors of the presence/absence of spawning dens using \{GAM\} models. O. vulgaris has a noteworthy preference for spawning in areas with hard bottom substrate and moderate depth (approximately 20 m). The higher density of spawning dens (1.08 ha‚àí1) was found in a surveyed area of 50.14 ha located in the northeastern part of the northern C{\'\i}es Island. We propose to protect the area comprised from Punta Escodelo to Punta Ferreiro between 5 and 30 m depth. This area has a surface of 158 ha equivalent to 5.98% of the total marine area of the C{\'\i}es islands. The strengths and weaknesses of a management strategy based on the protection of the species' spawning habitat are discussed. },

	Abstract = {Abstract We evaluated specific habitat features (bottom substrate type, depth, temperature, season and latitude-longitude) at random locations in the C{\'\i}es Islands (Galician Atlantic Islands National Park, Northwest Spain) to determine their impact on Sepia officinalis spawning habitat use. We performed underwater visual transects via scuba diving. In total, 94 transects were conducted between April 30, 2012 and July 17, 2015. Habitat features were evaluated as predictors of the presence/absence of egg clusters using Generalised Additive Models. Statistical analyses revealed the following: (a) the probability of finding eggs was significantly higher on hard bottom substrate type containing sea fans and sea tube worms; (b) the sectors where the egg presence was highest were the most shelters zones of Bajo de Vi{\~n}os and Piedra del Borr{\'o}n, two hard bottom shoals covered by sea fans and sea worms and located in the central C{\'\i}es Islands or Faro Island; (c) The preferential depth ranged from 8 to 13 m; (d) as temperatures rose, the probability of finding eggs decreased, which was a sign of the seasonality of the spawning event of the species; and (e) eggs were most common in the winter. A total of 18 additional non-random underwater visual transects were then performed in the Vi{\~n}os and Borr{\'o}n shoals between December 10, 2014 and August 20, 2015. We calculated the number of egg clusters found in two fenced areas (0.04 ha) located in Vi{\~n}os and Borr{\'o}n, which showed that Vi{\~n}os was a most suitable spawning habitat than Borr{\'o}n. The number of eggs per cluster varied from 4 to 82. The spawning period for this species lasted from the beginning of December until the end of June, when bottom temperature ranged from 12.5 $\,^{\circ}$C to 14.75 $\,^{\circ}$C. These microhabitat data reveal indicators of common cuttlefish spawning habitat utilisation and should help identify targets for habitat improvement projects and ecosystem management approaches within this national park and elsewhere. },

	Abstract = {The lasso estimate for linear regression corresponds to a posterior mode when independent, double-exponential prior distributions are placed on the regression coefficients. This paper introduces new aspects of the broader Bayesian treatment of lasso regression. A direct characterization of the regression coefficients' posterior distribution is provided, and computation and inference under this characterization is shown to be straightforward. Emphasis is placed on point estimation using the posterior mean, which facilitates prediction of future observations via the posterior predictive distribution. It is shown that the standard lasso prediction method does not necessarily agree with model-based, Bayesian predictions. A new Gibbs sampler for Bayesian lasso regression is introduced.},

	Abstract = {The experience of a patient in a survival study may be modelled as a process with two states and one possible transition from an "alive" state to a "dead" state. In some studies, however, the "alive" state may be partitioned into two or more intermediate (transient) states, each of which corresponding to a particular stage of the illness. In such studies, multi-state models can be used to model the movement of patients among the various states. In these models issues, of interest include the estimation of progression rates, assessing the effects of individual risk factors, survival rates or prognostic forecasting. In this article, we review modelling approaches for multi-state models, and we focus on the estimation of quantities such as the transition probabilities and survival probabilities. Differences between these approaches are discussed, focussing on possible advantages and disadvantages for each method. We also review the existing software currently available to fit the various models and present new software developed in the form of an R library to analyse such models. Different approaches and software are illustrated using data from the Stanford heart transplant study and data from a study on breast cancer conducted in Galicia, Spain.},

	Abstract = {{Conventional geostatistical methodology solves the problem of predicting the realized value of a linear functional of a Gaussian spatial stochastic process S(x) based on observations Yi = S(xi) + Zi at sampling locations xi, where the Zi are mutually independent, zero-mean Gaussian random variables. We describe two spatial applications for which Gaussian distributional assumptions are clearly inappropriate. The first concerns the assessment of residual contamination from nuclear weapons testing on a South Pacific island, in which the sampling method generates spatially indexed Poisson counts conditional on an unobserved spatially varying intensity of radioactivity; we conclude that a conventional geostatistical analysis oversmooths the data and underestimates the spatial extremes of the intensity. The second application provides a description of spatial variation in the risk of campylobacter infections relative to other enteric infections in part of north Lancashire and south Cumbria. For this application, we treat the data as binomial counts at unit postcode locations, conditionally on an unobserved relative risk surface which we estimate. The theoretical framework for our extension of geostatistical methods is that, conditionally on the unobserved process S(x), observations at sample locations xi form a generalized linear model with the corresponding values of S(xi) appearing as an offset term in the linear predictor. We use a Bayesian inferential framework, implemented via the Markov chain Monte Carlo method, to solve the prediction problem for non-linear functionals of S(x), making a proper allowance for the uncertainty in the estimation of any model parameters.}},

	Abstract = {Using quantile regression to analyze survival times offers an valuable complement to traditional Cox proportional hazards modelling. Unfortunately, this approach has been hampered by the lack of a conditional quantile estimator for censored data that is directly analogous to the {Kaplan-Meier} estimator and applies under standard assumptions for censored regression models. Here a recursively reweighted estimator of the regression quantile process is developed as a direct generalization of the {Kaplan-Meier} estimator. Specifically, the asymptotic behavior is directly analogous to that of the {Kaplan-Meier} estimator, and computation is essentially equivalent to current simplex methods for the quantile process in the uncensored case. Some preliminary examples suggest the strong potential of these methods as a complement to the use of Cox models.},

	Abstract = {Suppose that data (y, z) are observed from two regression models, y = f(x) + [var epsilon] and z = g(x) + [eta]. Of interest is testing the hypothesis H: f [triple bond; length as m-dash] g without assuming that f or g is in a parametric family. A test based on the difference between linear, but nonparametric, estimates of f and g is proposed. The exact distribution of the test statistic is obtained on the assumption that the errors in the two regression models are normally distributed. Asymptotic distribution theory is outlined under more general conditions on the errors. It is shown by simulation that the test based on the assumption of normal errors is reasonably robust to departures from normality. A data analysis illustrates that, in addition to being attractive descriptive devices, nonparametric smoothers can be valuable inference tools.},

	Abstract = {{The advance of technology facilitates the collection of statistical data. Flexible and refined statistical models are widely sought in a large array of statistical problems. The question arises frequently whether or not a family of parametric or nonparametric models fit adequately the given data. In this paper we give a selective overview on nonparametric inferences using generalized likelihood ratio (GLR) statistics. We introduce generalized likelihood ratio statistics to test various null hypotheses against nonparametric alternatives. The trade-off between the flexibility of alternative models and the power of the statistical tests is emphasized. Well-established Wilks' phenomena are discussed for a variety of semi- and non-parametric models, which sheds light on other research using GLR tests. A number of open topics worthy of further study are given in a discussion section.}},

	Abstract = {{Likelihood ratio theory has had tremendous success in parametric inference, due to the fundamental theory of Wilks. Yet, there is no general applicable approach for nonparametric inferences based on function estimation. Maximum likelihood ratio test statistics in general may not exist in nonparametric function estimation setting. Even if they exist, they are hard to find and can not be optimal as shown in this paper. We introduce the generalized likelihood statistics to overcome the drawbacks of nonparametric maximum likelihood ratio statistics. A new Wilks phenomenon is unveiled. We demonstrate that a class of the generalized likelihood statistics based on some appropriate nonparametric estimators are asymptotically distribution free and follow œá2-distributions under null hypotheses for a number of useful hypotheses and a variety of useful models including Gaussian white noise models, nonparametric regression models, varying coefficient models and generalized varying coefficient models. We further demonstrate that generalized likelihood ratio statistics are asymptotically optimal in the sense that they achieve optimal rates of convergence given by Ingster. They can even be adaptively optimal in the sense of Spokoiny by using a simple choice of adaptive smoothing parameter. Our work indicates that the generalized likelihood ratio statistics are indeed general and powerful for nonparametric testing problems based on function estimation.}},

	Abstract = {The choice of kernels for the nonparametric estimation of regression functions and of their derivatives is investigated. Explicit expressions are obtained for kernels minimizing the asymptotic variance or the asymptotic integrated mean square error, IMSE (the present proof of the optimality of the latter kernels is restricted up to order k = 5). These kernels are also of interest for the nonparametric estimation of probability densities and spectral densities. A finite sample study indicates that higher order kernels-asymptotically improving the rate of convergence-may become attractive for realistic finite sample size. Suitably modified kernels are considered for estimating at the extremities of the data, in a way which allows to retain the order of the bias found for interior points.},

The construction of such boundary kernels as solutions of a variational problem is addressed and representations in orthogonal polynomials are given, including explicit solutions for the most important cases. Based on explicit formulae for certain functional of the kernels, it is shown that local bandwidth variation might be indicated near boundaries. Various bandwidth variation schemes are discussed and investigated in a Monte Carlo study.},

	Abstract = {{Motivated by a representation for the least squares estimator, we propose a class of weighted jackknife variance estimators for the least squares estimator by deleting any fixed number of observations at a time. They are unbiased for homoscedastic errors and a special case, the delete-one jackknife, is almost unbiased for heteroscedastic errors. The method is extended to cover nonlinear parameters, regression M-estimators, nonlinear regression and generalized linear models. Interval estimators can be constructed from the jackknife histogram. Three bootstrap methods are considered. Two are shown to give biased variance estimators and one does not have the bias-robustness property enjoyed by the weighted delete-one jackknife. A general method for resampling residuals is proposed. It gives variance estimators that are bias-robust. Several bias-reducing estimators are proposed. Some simulation results are reported.}},

	Abstract = {Summary: The Scheff\'e method may be used to construct simultaneous confidence bands for a regression surface for the whole predictor space. When the bands need only hold for a subset of that space, previous authors have described how the bands can be appropriately narrowed while still maintaining the desired level of confidence. Data with heteroscedastic errors occur often, and unless some transformation is feasible, there is no obvious way to construct bands using the current methods. This article shows how to construct approximate simultaneous confidence bands when the errors are heteroscedastic and symmetric. The method works when the weights are known or unknown and have to be estimated. The region in which the bands must hold can be quite general and will work for any linear unbiased estimate of the regression surface. The method can even be extended to linear estimates with a small amount of bias such as nonparametric kernel regression smoothers.},

	Abstract = {Standard approaches to constructing nonparametric confidence bands for functions are frustrated by the impact of bias, which generally is not estimated consistently when using the bootstrap and conventionally smoothed function estimators. To overcome this problem it is common practice to either undersmooth, so as to reduce the impact of bias, or oversmooth, and thereby introduce an explicit or implicit bias estimator. However, these approaches, and others based on nonstandard smoothing methods, complicate the process of inference, for example by requiring the choice of new, unconventional smoothing parameters and, in the case of undersmoothing, producing relatively wide bands. In this paper we suggest a new approach, which exploits to our advantage one of the difficulties that, in the past, has prevented an attractive solution to this problem - the fact that the standard bootstrap bias estimator suffers from relatively high-frequency stochastic error. The high frequency, together with a technique based on quantiles, can be exploited to dampen down the stochastic error term, leading to relatively narrow, simple-to-construct confidence bands.},

@article{19942,
	Abstract = {The relationship between a response variable and one or more continuous covariates is often curved. Attempts to represent curvature in single- or multiple-regression models are usually made by means of polynomials of the covariates, typically quadratics. However, low order polynomials offer a limited family of shapes, and high order polynomials may fit poorly at the extreme values of the covariates. We propose an extended family of curves, which we call fractional polynomials, whose power terms are restricted to a small predefined set of integer and non-integer values. The powers are selected so that conventional polynomials are a subset of the family. Regression models using fractional polynomials of the covariates have appeared in the literature in an ad hoc fashion over a long period; we provide a unified description and a degree of formalization for them. They are shown to have considerable flexibility and are straightforward to fit using standard methods. We suggest an iterative algorithm for covariate selection and model fitting when several covariates are available. We give six examples of the use of fractional polynomial models in three types of regression analysis: normal errors, logistic and Cox regression. The examples all relate to medical data: fetal measurements, immunoglobulin concentrations in children, diabetes in children, infertility in women, myelomatosis (a type of leukaemia) and leg ulcers.},

	Abstract = {SUMMARY Although nonparametric regression has traditionally focused on the estimation of conditional mean functions, nonparametric estimation of conditional quantile functions is often of substantial practical interest. We explore a class of quantile smoothing splines, defined as solutions to minœÉ Pc(yi_g{(xi)}+Œª (int10lgn(x)/pdx)1/p with pt(u)=u{t_I(u< )}, pages; 1, and appropriately chosen G. For the particular choices p = 1 and p = ‚àû we characterise solutions g^ as splines, and discuss computation by standard l1-type linear programming techniques. At Œª =0, g^ interpolates the œÑ th quantiles at the distinct design points, and for Œª sufficiently large g^ is the linear regression quantile fit (Koenker & Bassett, 1978) to the observations. Because the methods estimate conditional quantile functions they possess an inherent robustness to extreme observations in the yi's. The entire path of solutions, in the quantile parameter œÑ, or the penalty parameter Œª2, may be efficiently computed by parametric linear programming methods. We note that the approach may be easily adapted to impose monotonicity and/or convexity constraints on the fitted function. An example is provided to illustrate the use of the proposed methods.},

	Abstract = {A simple minimization problem yielding the ordinary sample quantiles in the location model is shown to generalize naturally to the linear model generating a new class of statistics we term "regression quantiles."  The estimator which minimizes the sum of absolute residuals is an important special case.  Some equivariance properties and the joint aymptotic distribution of regression quantiles are established.  These results permit a natural generalization to the linear model of certain well-known robust estimators of location.  Estimators are suggested, which have comparable efficiency to least squares for Gaussian linear models while substantially out-performing the least-squares estimator over a wide class of non-Gaussian error distributions.},

	Abstract = {{Recently, researchers in several areas of ecology and evolution have begun to change the way in which they analyze data and make biological inferences. Rather than the traditional null hypothesis testing approach, they have adopted an approach called model selection, in which several competing hypotheses are simultaneously confronted with data. Model selection can be used to identify a single best model, thus lending support to one particular hypothesis, or it can be used to make inferences based on weighted support from a complete set of competing models. Model selection is widely accepted and well developed in certain fields, most notably in molecular systematics and mark--recapture analysis. However, it is now gaining support in several other areas, from molecular evolution to landscape ecology. Here, we outline the steps of model selection and highlight several ways that it is now being implemented. By adopting this approach, researchers in ecology and evolution will find a valuable alternative to traditional null hypothesis testing, especially when more than one hypothesis is plausible.}},

@book{burnham02,
	Abstract = {{The second edition of this book is unique in that it focuses on methods for making formal statistical inference from all the models in an a priori set (Multi-Model Inference). A philosophy is presented for model-based data analysis and a general strategy outlined for the analysis of empirical data. The book invites increased attention on a priori science hypotheses and modeling.   Kullback-Leibler Information represents a fundamental quantity in science and is Hirotugu Akaike's basis for model selection. The maximized log-likelihood function can be bias-corrected as an estimator of expected, relative Kullback-Leibler information. This leads to Akaike's Information Criterion (AIC) and various extensions. These methods are relatively simple and easy to use in practice, but based on deep statistical theory. The information theoretic approaches provide a unified and rigorous theory, an extension of likelihood theory, an important application of information theory, and are objective and practical to employ across a very wide class of empirical problems.   The book presents several new ways to incorporate model selection uncertainty into parameter estimates and estimates of precision. An array of challenging examples is given to illustrate various technical issues.   This is an applied book written primarily for biologists and statisticians wanting to make inferences from multiple models and is suitable as a graduate text or as a reference for professional analysts.}},

@book{citeulike:161814,
	Abstract = {{During the past decade there has been an explosion in computation and
information technology. With it has come vast amounts of data in a variety of
fields such as medicine, biology, finance, and marketing. The challenge of
understanding these data has led to the development of new tools in the field
of statistics, and spawned new areas such as data mining, machine learning,
and bioinformatics.

Many of these tools have common underpinnings but are often expressed with
different terminology. This book describes the important ideas in these areas
in a common conceptual framework. While the approach is statistical, the
emphasis is on concepts rather than mathematics. Many examples are given, with
a liberal use of color graphics. It should be a valuable resource for
statisticians and anyone interested in data mining in science or industry.

The book's coverage is broad, from supervised learning (prediction) to
unsupervised learning. The many topics include neural networks, support vector
machines, classification trees and boosting--the first comprehensive treatment
of this topic in any book.

Trevor Hastie, Robert Tibshirani, and Jerome Friedman are professors of
statistics at Stanford University. They are prominent researchers in this
area: Hastie and Tibshirani developed generalized additive models and wrote a
popular book of that title. Hastie wrote much of the statistical modeling
software in S-PLUS and invented principal curves and surfaces. Tibshirani
proposed the Lasso and is co-author of the very successful An Introduction to
the Bootstrap. Friedman is the co-inventor of many data-mining tools including
CART, MARS, and projection pursuit.

FROM THE REVIEWS:

TECHNOMETRICS "[This] is a vast and complex book. Generally, it concentrates
on explaining why and how the methods work, rather than how to use them.
Examples and especially the visualizations are principle features...As a
source for the methods of statistical learning...it will probably be a long
time before there is a competitor to this book."}},

	Abstract = {{We propose a new method for estimation in linear models. The \&quot;lasso\&quot; minimizes the residual sum of squares subject to the sum of the absolute value of the coefficients being less than a constant. Because of the nature of this constraint it tends to produce some coefficients that are exactly zero and hence gives interpretable models. Our simulation studies suggest that the lasso enjoys some of the favourable properties of both subset selection and ridge regression. It produces interpretable models like subset selection and exhibits the stability of ridge regression. There is also an interesting relationship with recent work in adaptive function estimation by Donoho and Johnstone. The lasso idea is quite general and can be applied in a variety of statistical models: extensions to generalized regression models}},

	Abstract = {Representation of generalized additive models ({GAM}'s) using penalized regression splines allows {GAM}'s to be employed in a straightforward manner using penalized regression methods. Not only is inference facilitated by this approach, but it is also possible to integrate model selection in the form of smoothing parameter selection into model fitting in a computationally efficient manner using well founded criteria such as generalized cross-validation. The current fitting and smoothing parameter selection methods for such models are usually effective, but do not provide the level of numerical stability to which users of linear regression packages, for example, are accustomed. In particular the existing methods cannot deal adequately with numerical rank deficiency of the {GAM} fitting problem, and it is not straightforward to produce methods that can do so, given that the degree of rank deficiency can be smoothing parameter dependent. In addition, models with the potential flexibility of {GAM}'s can also present practical fitting difficulties as a result of indeterminacy in the model likelihood: Data with many zeros fitted by a model with a log link are a good example. In this article it is proposed that {GAM}'s with a ridge penalty provide a practical solution in such circumstances, and a multiple smoothing parameter selection method suitable for use in the presence of such a penalty is developed. The method is based on the pivoted {QR} decomposition and the singular value decomposition, so that with or without a ridge penalty it has good error propagation properties and is capable of detecting and coping elegantly with numerical rank deficiency. The method also allows mixtures of user specified and estimated smoothing parameters and the setting of lower bounds on smoothing parameters. In terms of computational efficiency, the method compares well with existing methods. A simulation study compares the method to existing methods, including treating {GAM}'s as mixed models.},

	Abstract = {We propose a new test for the comparison of two regression curves that is based on a difference of two marked empirical processes based on residuals. The large sample behavior of the corresponding statistic is studied to provide a full nonparametric comparison of regression curves. In contrast to most procedures suggested in the literature, the new procedure is applicable in the case of different design points and heteroscedasticity. Moreover, it is demonstrated that the proposed test detects continuous alternatives converging to the null at a rate N-1/2 and that, in contrast to all other available procedures based on marked empirical processes, the new test allows the optimal choice of bandwidths for curve estimation (e.g., N-l/5 in the case of twice differentiable regression functions). As a by-product we explain the problems of a related test proposed by Kulasekera [J. Amer. Statist. Assoc. 90 (1995) 1085-1093] and Kulasekera and Wang [J. Amer. Statist. Assoc. 92 (1997) 500-511] with respect to accuracy in the approximation of the level. These difficulties mainly originate from the comparison with the quantiles of an inappropriate limit distribution. A simulation study is conducted to investigate the finite sample properties of a wild bootstrap version of the new test and to compare it with the so far available procedures. Finally, heteroscedastic data is analyzed in order to demonstrate the benefits of the new test compared to the so far available procedures which require homoscedasticity.},

	Abstract = {In the problem of testing the equality of k regression curves from independent samples, we discuss three methods using nonparametric estimators of the regression function. The first test is based on a linear combination of estimators for the integrated variance function in the individual samples and in the combined sample. The second approach transfers the classical one-way analysis of variance to the situation of comparing nonparametric curves, while the third test compares the differences between the estimates of the individual regression functions by means of an L2-distance. We prove asymptotic normality of all considered statistics under the null hypothesis and local and fixed alternatives with different rates corresponding to the various cases. Additionally, consistency of a wild bootstrap version of the tests is established. In contrast to most of the procedures proposed in the literature, the methods introduced in this paper are also applicable in the case of different design points in each sample and heteroscedastic errors. A simulation study is conducted to investigate the finite sample properties of the new tests and a comparison with recently proposed and related procedures is performed.},

	Abstract = {Nonparametric curves occur in a wide variety of contexts, including repeated measurements mean profiles, survivor functions and in different types of smoothing techniques such as nonparametric regression and density estimation. In some cases confidence bands can be attached to these curves as an indication of the variability of estimation. This is more difficult in the case of nonparametric regression and density estimation where bias is present. In the important case of the comparison of two curves, attention can be focused instead on whether there are differences between the curves. In this paper, the idea of a reference band for the comparison of two curves is introduced. The band is derived from the standard error of the difference between the two curves at each point. The band have a simple hypothesis testing interpretation which applies equally well to smoothing methods where bias occurs. It does not remove the need for a global test of effects of interest, but it can be very useful as a graphical means of exploring where any identified differences might lie, or of explaining why apparent differences do not actually contribute strong evidence of statistical significance to the global comparison of curves. Reference bands for equality are derived and explored in a variety of settings. Reference bands for parallelism are also derived for nonparametric regression models. Reference bands for parametric models, against which nonparametric regression and density estimates can be compared, are derived for linearity and for normality.},

	Abstract = {Nonparametric regression using locally weighted least squares was first discussed by Stone and by Cleveland. Recently, it was shown by Fan and by Fan and Gijbels that the local linear kernel-weighted least squares regression estimator has asymptotic properties making it superior, in certain senses, to the Nadaraya-Watson and Gasser-Muller kernel estimators. In this paper we extend their results on asymptotic bias and variance to the case of multivariate predictor variables. We are able to derive the leading bias and variance terms for general multivariate kernel weights using weighted least squares matrix theory. This approach is especially convenient when analysing the asymptotic conditional bias and variance of the estimator at points near the boundary of the support of the predictors. We also investigate the asymptotic properties of the multivariate local quadratic least squares regression estimator discussed by Cleveland and Devlin and, in the univariate case, higher-order polynomial fits and derivative estimation.},

	Abstract = { In many electrophysiological experiments the main objectives include estimation of the firing rate of a single neuron, as well as a comparison of its temporal evolution across different experimental conditions. To accomplish these two goals, we propose a flexible approach based on the logistic generalized additive model including condition-by-time interactions. If an interaction of this type is detected in the model, we then establish that the use of the temporal odds ratio curves is very useful in discriminating between the conditions under which the firing probability is higher. Bootstrap techniques are used for testing for interactions and constructing pointwise confidence bands for the true odds ratio curves. Finally, we apply the new methodology to assessing relationships between neural response and decision-making in movement-selective neurons in the prefrontal cortex of behaving monkeys.

The practical implementation of any scatterplot smoother is greatly enhanced by the availability of a reliable rule for automatic selection of the smoothing parameter. In this article we apply the ideas of plug-in bandwidth selection to develop strategies for choosing the smoothing parameter of local linear squares kernel estimators. Our results are applicable to odd-degree local polynomial fits and can be extended to other settings, such as derivative estimation and multiple nonparametric regression. An implementation in the important case of local linear fits with univariate predictors is shown to perform well in practice. A by-product of our work is the development of a class of nonparametric variance estimators, based on local least squares ideas, and plug-in rules for their implementation.},

Stalked barnacle (Pollicipes pollicipes) harvesting in the Berlengas Nature Reserve, Portugal: temporal variation and validation of logbook data. - ICES Journal of Marine Science, 67: 000-000. Stalked barnacle (Pollicipes pollicipes) exploitation at the Berlengas Nature Reserve, Portugal, by professional harvesters has been subject to specific regulation since 2000. The only available information on barnacle exploitation there comes from catch reports (logbooks) provided by the harvesters. We evaluated the quality of the logbook information, described the temporal patterns of P. pollicipes fishing effort from 2000 to 2006 based on the logbook data, and modelled the daily fishing effort in relation to variability in oceanographic conditions. Results suggest different levels of reliability for the information contained in the logbooks: (i) information on the date of harvest seems to be reliable because 83% of the observed harvest dates were also declared; (ii) information on the quantity harvested shows a large discrepancy (mean = 31.8%) between declared and observed amounts, but we believe it can be used to analyse temporal patterns of exploitation, because there was no systematic bias (under- and overreporting was to the same extent). The total quantity of barnacles harvested between 2000 and 2006 ([~]16 t year-1) was closely related to the effort applied. Daily harvesting effort was considered a function of two predictive variables (significant wave height and tidal range) and of their interaction. Neither the harvesting activity nor the resource itself seems to be at risk of collapse if such levels of pressure are maintained, but efforts should be made to increase surveillance and monitoring within the marine protected area.},

	Abstract = {The gooseneck barnacle (Pollicipes pollicipes) is a highly exploited species in Spain and Portugal due to the great commercial demand and the high prices in the market. Due to the inaccessibility of the Gaztelugatxe coastal area (Basque Country, Northern Spain), the gooseneck barnacle has maintained one of the greatest populations of the Basque coast in this area. Declared as a marine reserve by means of the 229/1998 (Basque Government) Decree, a 2 years moratorium in the gooseneck shellfishing was established. Facing the possibility of the gooseneck barnacle fishery opening in the area of the biotope, it was noticed the need for the development of a management tool, capable to think over the different management decisions: from the complete conservation of the system to the sustainable exploitation of the resource, joining together different social and biological factors, allowing the protection of the firsts (protection of the stock) and the development of the seconds (fishery activity). Based on the population dynamics of the gooseneck barnacle, a system dynamic model dominated by one positive and three negative loops was developed. The positive loop portrays the reproductive and maturation process, ultimately producing more adult gooseneck barnacles. The negative loops cause the stabilisation as the different stages of the population expire due by natural causes and exploitation of the resource. According to the model results, the best management decision is the maintenance of the moratorium. Taking into account the dispersion capability of larvae, other areas near the reserve, and subjected to commercial exploitation like Ogo{\~n}o, Izaro and cape Villano, will benefit from the protection of Gaztelugatxe production. In the case of exploitation, the best management decision, which maximises captures and minimises the stock looses in a sustainable manner, is an alternate exploitation between Aketxe and Gaztelugatxe coastal areas of the marine reserve.},

	Abstract = {1. The stalked barnacle, Pollicipes polymerus, occurs often in dense masses in the exposed midlittoral of the American west coast. 2. The animals are orientated on the rocks so that the cirral net faces the rush of water after the waves have broken and as they pour over the rocks and boulders. 3. The orientation appears to be mediated through the cirri; comparison is made with the twisting movements of operculate barnacles. 4. Activity to non-directional currents is discussed; a certain level of current flow or turbulence is required before normal feeding activity begins. 5. The spat, which settles largely on the peduncles of adults, is orientated within the pits formed by the calcareous scales. 6. Spontaneous activity of valves and peduncle is demonstrated. The former consists of opening and closing movements and the latter of bending, contraction and expansion. This inherent activity occurs in air and water. 7. The animals grow very slowly: some of the largest individuals may be 20 years old. Maturity is only reached after 5 years. 8. It is shown that the specialized behaviour allows the species to maintain itself in a restricted part of the intertidal zone against competition from faster-growing animals that mature quickly and produce large broods of young.},

	Abstract = {Pedunculate cirripedes, particularly those found on floating objects washed up on the shore, have long been called goose (or gooseneck) barnacles because of their graceful appearance and the long stalk that resembles the neck of a goose. These barnacles are rarely found growing on fixed intertidal substrata. The only truly intertidal pedunculate cirripedes belong to the genus Pollicipes of which there are three species. Two are found on the west coast of the Americas and the third in European. Very little is known about P. elegans from South America. P. polymerus is found on the Pacific coast of North America extending from 27 degree N to 64 degree N. P. pollicipes is less eurythermal than P. polymerus and has rarely been found north of the Atlantic coast of France; the most southerly record is about 15 degree N. Most of this review concerns P. polymerus and P. pollicipes because of the lack of published work on P. elegans. A general description of the animals, the arrangement of the calcified plates, the muscles and the nervous system have all been considered. The animals favour exposed habitats where there is a backwash from surging waves. The strength of the peduncle and its ability to bring the capitulum and the cirri into the bet position is related to the captorial method of feeding. A high haemolymph pressure and the musculature of the peduncle enable it to contract or lengthen according to the environmental conditions. The peduncle plays a vital part in combating the effects of temperature change and desiccation. It provides an additional surface for gaseous exchange, and a substratum for settling cyprids. The size of adults at maturity and their fecundity, spermatogenesis and oogenesis have all been discussed. Fertilization, development of embryos, and sizes of nauplii have been compared for the species. The ultrastructure of the membranes involved in fertilization and development of embryos has been examined. Chemical analyses of bodies, egg lamellae, and calcified structures have been determined. Predation and the effect of pollution have been found to be important. The commercial exploitation of all three species and its future possibilities have been examined.},

	Abstract = {1. The tolerances to salinity changes, both above and below that of normal sea water, by the larvae of the three barnacle species, Balanus balanoides, Elminius modestus and Chthamalus stellatus, were broadly similar, except at the more extreme temperatures. Salinities below 12 per thousand or above 50 per thousand caused complete immobility. 2. The nauplii of the winter breeding form, Balanus balanoides, exhibited a reduction in salinity tolerance with rising temperature up to 31 degrees C, at which only 4 h survival was possible at normal salinities. The nauplii of the summer breeding form, Chthamalus stellatus, were more tolerant at high temperatures and withstood salinities between 25 and 45 per thousand for 24 h at 35 degrees C. Elminius modestus larvae withstood the same conditions for only 8 h. 3. At normal temperatures, larvae of the estuarine form E. modestus were the most tolerant of salinity extremes. 4. The rate of oxygen uptake by E. modestus nauplii fell as the salinity deviated on either side of the normal value for sea water, and approached zero when the larvae were rendered inactive. 5. All three species could withstand temperatures and salinities much greater than those that they could possibily experience in the sea. It is suggested that this apparently unnecessary degree of tolerance may represent an adaption to pre-hatching stresses, to which they are exposed in the mantle of the adult.},

Patterns of seasonal brooding activity reveal two physiological races: a northern one with maximum brooding activity at cold seawater temperatures (14 degree C or less) and a southern one which broods most at warmer temperatures (20 degree C). The distribution of these two races corresponds, respectively, to the cold and warm temperate zones located north and south of Point Conception. Laboratory experiments support field results that the northern physiological race broods at lower temperatures than the southern physiological race and that seasonal brooding activity is controlled more by water temperature than by food.},

	Abstract = {1. Feeding responses were elicited when solutions of amino acids and of organic and inorganic cations were applied to the cirri and mouth parts of Lepas and other barnacles. Proteins, peptides, sugars, neutral organic molecules, and anions were without effect.2. Of the common amino acids, Lepas anatifera was most responsive to L-glutamic acid and L-proline. It was very sensitive also to betaine and taurine.3. The order of sensitivity to amino acids and to other zwitterionic substances did not correlate with any obvious physical or chemical property.4. Inorganic and organic cations had to be applied at higher concentrations than many amino acids to produce a response and probably acted on different receptors. The potassium ion had the greatest effect of those tested.5. The observed sensitivity to amino acids and to potassium ions is thought to enable the animal to recognize living prey after it has been pierced by the setae present on the cirri.},

	Abstract = {Pollicipes pollicipes is widely used as food and is the subject of intensive fisheries in Portugal. Since November 1990 growth of this species was studied on the SW coast of Portugal. Two kinds of methods were used: (1) individual growth: the adjacent substrata were marked with polyester resin and the organisms were mapped and measured (Rostro-Carina length=RC) every month; 2) spatial variability of allometric growth: various biometrical measures were used for animals from different habitats; the relationship between these values and the organic weight were established. The results of these analyses suggest that there are spatial (due to tide and light related factors) and temporal differences (growth rates are higher in spring and summer) in the growth of this pedunculate barnacle. In this study RC was the biometrical variable that best represented the linear growth of this species and we recommended its use for fishery control purposes.},

	Abstract = {The brooding period of Pollicipes pollicipes on the southwestern coast of Portugal in 1991 began in March and extended to October, and was more intense from April-September. Brooding activity in small animals (12.5-15 mm, rostrocarinal distance, RC) was significantly less than in large animals (RC > 15 mm). Brooding activity patterns of this species were considered to be similar at different tidal levels and subtidally. Crowded animals brooded less than uncrowded animals, but results could have been confounded by the fact that only one site was considered. Individuals apparently produce asynchronous broods. Estimates of the annual number of broods varied between 1 (crowded animals), 1 or 2 (small, uncrowded animals), and 4 (large, uncrowded animals). Small animals (mean RC = 15.4 mm; 16,229 eggs) produced about half the number of eggs of large animals (mean RC = 19.6 mm; 34,172 eggs). Fecundity was considered to be a function of size (RC) (after logarithmic transformation; r super(2) = 0.62). A variable number of eggs was produced by animals of the same size; animals with an RC from 23-25 mm ranging from 30,000-130,000 eggs per brood. Fecundity patterns were considered similar in relation to tidal level, crowding, and time in the reproductive season.},

	Abstract = {The reproductive cycle of the pedunculate barnacle Pollicipes pollicipes from two intertidal levels (mid and low) at Cabo de Sines, south-west coast of Portugal has been described. Pollicipes pollicipes larger than 12.5 mm (rostrocarinal distance, RC) are simultaneous hermaphrodites. Minimum size for maturity of the female gonad was 12.5 mm (RC) whilst sperm production is achieved at a smaller size (10 mm). The breeding season was from April to September. Reproductive activity was similar at both tidal levels and was significantly correlated with seawater temperature. Brooding activity was most pronounced in late spring and summer when seawater temperature ranged from 18 to 21 degree C. Throughout the year, sperm was stored in the seminal vesicles, although the testes regressed from October-December. The female gonad was resting in October-January and active during March-September. During resting, only a few empty ovarioles were observed. At the beginning and in the middle of the reproductive season (March to August), the ovary was completely disrupted after fertilization and ovary recovery occurred simultaneously with egg development. During the end of the reproductive season (September-October), synchrony was retarded as recovery of the ovary was slower than egg development. The pattern of functioning of the female gonad should allow production of several broods during the season.},

	Abstract = {The distribution of cirripede cyprids in relation to associated oceanographic conditions was obtained from a grid survey and intensive vertical sampling at a fixed station located 21 km off the northwest Portuguese coast in May 2002. Analysis of cyprid length composition allowed separation of 3 species groups. Chthamalus montagui, Pollicipes pollicipes and Balanus perforatus were largely restricted to the neuston layer and showed only low- amplitude vertical migration. Most C. stellatus cyprids only appeared in the upper 20 m at night, a migration which did not appear to be affected by physical conditions in the water column, but some differences in the vertical migration pattern between days were probably related to varying light penetration. C. montagui is the most abundant adult species found along the Portuguese coast, but C. stellatus cyprids, at densities of up to 8.7 ind. m super(-3), were the most common sampled in all depth strata at the fixed station. Cyprid horizontal distribution was mainly restricted to an offshore band along the inner shelf, where highest densities were 11 to 15 ind. m super(-3). This distribution pattern was considered to result from upwelling-favourable wind conditions, creating fronts along the shelf in which the cyprids become concentrated. Cyprid vertical migration, in association with current vertical shear and onshore movement of fronts during upwelling-relaxation periods, may be the mechanisms returning cyprids to the coast to settle. The regularity of these events in the region falls within the period of cyprid viability.},

(2)The body temp of air-exposed animals is always lower than expected from the heat load. Evaporation from the peduncle is responsible for the heat loss. (3)The rate of water loss by evaporation from the peduncle cuticle is 1.5 mu l/cm super(2) hr mm Hg both at 21 and 27 degree C. The transpiration is proportional to the saturation deficit of the air. The water loss from the capitulum is negligible in comparison to that from the peduncle. (4)The haemolymph osmolality of animals in the field increases during exposure to sunshine and decreases during exposure to rain. The increase in haemolymph osmolality during desiccation is equal to that calculated from the decrease in body water The water loss during air exposure is adequately replaced during submersion, probably by osmosis. (5)Pollicipes is an osmoconformer but is 5-20 mosmoles hyperosmotic. It tolerates sea-water dilutions down to similar to 50%. The hyperosmolality seems to be balanced by a high internal hydrostatic pressure. (6) An excretory activity is observed. The excretion is isosmotic to the haemolymph and is possibly an ultrafiltrate of the latter. (7) The muscle cells show vol regulation, but free amino acids seem to be unimportant in regulation of intracellular osmolality. The conc of ninhydrin-positive substances in the muscle tissue is about 200 mM for animals in full strength sea water.},

	Abstract = {1. The gross structure of the reproductive system of M. polymerus is described and compared with that of the southern hemisphere species, M. spinosus (studied by Bathanm, 1944-45).2. Size and reproductive activity in M. polymerus are related. All animals over 27.5 mm. in breadth (distance from rostrum to carina) are found to reproduce; smaller animals are found to contain developing embryos less frequently. No sexually mature animals less than 17.2 mm. in breadth were found.3. A fifteen-month study of the reproductive cycle in the population is described. Reproductive activity is evident during the greater part of the year. For the year of 1957, developing embryos were present in the population for a period of eight months durinig which time the shore temperature ranged from 12.3{degrees} C. to 17{degrees} C. The reproductive season for the southern hemisphere species likewise occurs during the warmest months; thus the yearly cycle of M. polymerus shows a perhaps expected mirror image of the situation occurrinig in the southern hemisphere.4. Within individuals, male and female gonads mature at approximately the same time during the year, and during the greater part of the year, an individual contains both developing eggs and seminal vesicles full of sperm.5. Stages of development of ovarian eggs and brooded embryos found simultaneously in individuals are compared. During the early and middle months of the reproductive season, ovarian eggs and brooded embryos tend to be in similar stages of development (that is, small eggs are found with early stage embryos, large eggs with late stage embryos, etc.). During the later reproductive months, a relative lag in ovarian egg development is evident.6. Embryos were raised in vitro under controlled temperatures. The embryos took an average time of thirty days for development from fertilized egg to free-swimming larva.7. Estimates are given of the number of broods of young and the number of larvae liberated by a large individual during a year, and these are compared with the results of Batham (1944-45) for M. spinosus. Studies of the larval brood period, the stages of eggs and embryos found simultaneously in individuals, and the length of the reproductive season allow an hypothesis that five to seven broods may be liberated by a large individual durinig a year. Three to four broods appears more probable for an average large animal. A pair of ovigerous lamellae may contain from 104,000 to 240,000 larvae. Batham's data (1944-45) showed that probably two broods, each containing approximately 3000 larvae, are liberated by M. spinosus during a year. Thus M. polymerus may liberate from 52 to 280 times as many larvae per year as a single large M. spinosus.8. The possibility of self-fertilization in M. polymerus is studied. Relatively isolated large animals are found to carry ovigerous lamellae less frequently than those adjacent to each other; and large animals isolated from each other by over eight inches were never found carrying embryos. From this evidence, it appears that self-fertilization does not occur in this species, and that cross-fertilization is necessary for the formation of ovigerous lamellae.},

	Abstract = {Short-term qualitative observations were made during the summer of 1980 on 30 aggregates of barnacles along the Washington State (USA) coastline to study the distribution of recently settled juveniles within aggregates. The juveniles were not randomly distributed on the peduncles of adults, but rather a gradient of sizes existed with the smallest and most abundant positioned on the peduncles immediately adjacent to the capitula, and the largest and fewest in number located basally near the attachment disks. Very few, if any, juveniles were found on the capitula. This lack of juveniles may be due in part to a mixed population of small cryptically colored limpets, species of Collisella and Notoacmaea , that are found on the capitular valves. Since the valves appeared relatively free of other encrusting organisms, these gastropods may graze or bulldoze off cyprids and other settling organisms in a manner similar to what has been reported for limpets grazing on rocky substrata.},

Mean relocation speeds of up to 50 mu m d super(-1) were measured for both scalpellids, which are probably underestimates of maximal rates given the absence of a directed stimulus. In the laboratory neither gravity nor unidirectional flow proved effective stimuli in directing scalpellid relocation. The two scalpellid species use quite different mechanisms to effect relocation at a leading edge of the base, although both slough basal material at the trailing edge. It is suggested that basal growth effectively accounts for the mobility of P. pollicipes but C. mitella is likely to employ muscular activity.},

Stage I and II P. pollicipes nauplii reared from laboratory maintained adults were similarly sized to those reared from egg masses collected from the Algarve (Portugal). P. pollicipes larvae were larger than P. polymerus nauplii at each developmental stage, but differences in rearing conditions make it impossible to establish the cause.

	Abstract = {The timing of larval release and the cues that control these rhythms (tidal, diurnal, or lunar cycles) were studied over a 2 mo period in the cirripeds Pollicipes pollicipes, Balanus spp. and Chthamalus spp., occurring on an exposed rocky shore in NW Spain. All of them showed rhythms of larval release, but the rhythms were different in each species. Chthamalus spp., which principally inhabit the upper intertidal zone, released their larvae mainly during diurnal high tides at the time of new and full moons. Larval release was greater during the afternoon than during the morning, because the amplitude of afternoon high tides was significantly higher than that of morning high tides. P. pollicipes larvae were released at morning high tide during waning moon and, to a lesser extent, during full moon. Nauplii of Balanus spp. were released during new and waning moons; almost no release occurred during full moon, and no larvae were found during the waxing moon, mainly during diurnal high tides. P. pollicipes and Balanus spp. usually began to release larvae after sunrise, which may be the factor inducing synchrony. In contrast, Chthamalus spp. released larvae at any time of day, but always coinciding with high tide, indicating that seawater may be the cue that triggers larval release in this species. Although larval release should occur during safe periods (e.g. night-time) in species such as those under study, with small unprotected colored larvae that are visible to predators, almost no larvae of any of the 3 cirripeds were found at night. Cirriped Nauplius I larvae respond positively to light, allowing larvae to travel upwards in the water column, away from congeners that could incidentally ingest their own larvae, and are transported offshore away from predators, which are more abundant close to the shore. At night this photopositive behavior does not take place, and thus the synchrony in the emission of larvae during daytime induces larval aggregation, which may increase larval survival because of the swamp effect over predators.},

	Abstract = {The goose barnacle, Pollicipes pollicipes, is an intertidal cirripede that lives attached to rocks on very exposed shores, forming dense aggregations. It occurs in the northeast Atlantic (from 48 to 14 degree N). Commercial fisheries have been developed in several countries, but except for a short-lived local consumption, most of the production is traded in the Spanish market, where the price can reach ?80/kg in first-sale auctions. This species shows a strong spatial structure, constituting metapopulations with local adult populations sharing a common larval pool. Advection of larvae depends largely of oceanographic conditions that govern larval transport and survival. In Galicia (NW Spain), the regional government regulations promote a co-management system between fishers' organisations ('cofradias') and the fisheries authority through territorial user rights for fishing (TURFs). Since 1992, the exploitation is granted to 'cofradias' after presentation of an annual plan of exploitation and management, where fishing (daily allocation of effort, maximum individual quotas and area of exploitation), surveillance and the commercialisation processes are established. The recent implementation of a geographic information system (GIS) designed for the management of Pollicipes in Galicia will allow for new ways to improve the elaboration and control of management plans by fishers' organisations using a combination of the available statistical data and computer-based methods. The system, including databases and software for the visualisation of geographic information, was designed for independent use in each 'cofradia' or in a network, and its results are accessible in a web site (http://sigremar.cesga.es, ).},

	Abstract = {(1) Gas exchange water and in air of the intertidal cirriped Pollicipes polymerus has been studied by combined field and laboratory experiments. (2) Haemolymph gas tensions and pH are correlated with the tidal cycle in the field. Air exposure is accompanied by increasing O Sub(2) and CO Sub(2) tensions, and by decreasing haemolymph pH. During resubmersion the respiratory parameters are restored to values typical of the submerged state. There is no accumulation of lactic acid during air exposure. (3) The O Sub(2) uptake of Pollicipes is higher for air exposed than for submerged animals at each tested temp. In air exposed animals the O Sub(2) uptake shows a decreasing Q Sub(10) with increasing temp between 2 and 27{degree}C. Pollicipes exhibits O Sub(2) conformity under varying ambient O Sub(2) tensions and no O Sub(2) debt is found after exposure to hypoxic water. (4) The peduncle cuticle is permeable to O Sub(2) and cutaneous respiration at this level may contribute significantly to the overall O Sub(2) uptake. (5) Pollicipes is well adapted to respiratory gas exchange both in water and in air making it a successful sp in the intertidal community.},
