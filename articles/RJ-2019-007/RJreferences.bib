  abstract = {This paper considers VAR models incorporating many time series that interact through a few dynamic factors. Several econometric issues are addressed including estimation of the number of dynamic factors and tests for the factor restrictions imposed on the VAR. Structural VAR identification based on timing restrictions, long run restrictions, and restrictions on factor loadings are discussed and practical computational methods suggested. Empirical analysis using U.S. data suggest several (7) dynamic factors, rejection of the exact dynamic factor model but support for an approximate factor model, and sensible results for a SVAR that identifies money policy shocks using timing restrictions.},

  abstract = {This article discusses dynamic factor analysis, a technique for estimating common trends in multivariate time series. Unlike more common time series techniques such as spectral analysis and ARIMA models, dynamic factor analysis can analyse short, non-stationary time series containing missing values. Typically, the parameters in dynamic factor analysis are estimated by direct optimization, which means that only small data sets can be analysed if computing time is not to become prohibitively long and the chances of obtaining sub-optimal estimates are to be avoided. This article shows how the parameters of dynamic factor analysis can be estimated using the EM algorithm, allowing larger data sets to be analysed. The technique is illustrated on a marine environmental data set. Copyright \textcopyright{} 2003 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

  abstract = {Dynamic factor analysis (DFA) is a technique used to detect common patterns in a set of time series and relationships between these series and explanatory variables. Although DFA is used widely in econometric and psychological fields, it has not been used in fisheries and aquatic sciences to the best of our knowledge. To make the technique more widely accessible, an introductory guide for DFA, at an intermediate level, is presented in this paper. A case study is presented. The analysis of 13 landings-per-unit-effort series for Nephrops around northern Europe identified three common trends for 12 of the series, with one series being poorly fitted, but no relationships with the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) or sea surface temperature were found. The 12 series could be divided into six groups based on factor loadings from the three trends., L'analyse factorielle dynamique (DFA) est une technique qui permet de d{\'e}tecter les structures communes dans des s{\'e}ries temporelles, ainsi que les relations entre les s{\'e}ries et les variables explicatives.

  abstract = {A new class of space-time models derived from standard dynamic factor models is proposed. The temporal dependence is modeled by latent factors while the spatial dependence is modeled by the factor loadings. Factor analytic arguments are used to help identify temporal components that summarize most of the spatial variation of a given region. The temporal evolution of the factors is described in a number of forms to account for different aspects of time variation such as trend and seasonality. The spatial dependence is incorporated into the factor loadings by a combination of deterministic and stochastic elements thus giving them more flexibility and generalizing previous approaches. The new structure implies nonseparable space-time variation to observables, despite its conditionally independent nature, while reducing the overall dimensionality, and hence complexity, of the problem. The number of factors is treated as another unknown parameter and fully Bayesian inference is performed via a reversible jump Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithm. The new class of models is tested against one synthetic dataset and applied to pollution data obtained from the Clean Air Status and Trends Network (CASTNet). Our factor model exhibited better predictive performance when compared to benchmark models, while capturing important aspects of spatial and temporal behavior of the data.},

We discuss model fitting based on retrospective data and sequential analysis for forward filtering and short-term forecasting. Analyses are compared with results from the much simpler method of dynamic variance-matrix discounting that, for over a decade, has been a standard approach in applied financial econometrics. We study these models in analysis, forecasting, and sequential portfolio allocation for a selected set of international exchange-rate-return time series. Our goals are to understand a range of modeling questions arising in using these factor models and to explore empirical performance in portfolio construction relative to discount approaches.

This view is misguided since PCA and factor analysis, as usually defined, are really quite distinct techniques. The confusion may have arisen, in part, because of Hotelling's (1933) original paper, in which principal components were introduced in the context of providing a small number of `more fundamental' variables which determine the values of the p original variables. This is very much in the spirit of the factor model introduced in Section 7.1, although Girschick (1936) indicates that there were soon criticisms of Hotelling's method of PCs, as being inappropriate for factor analysis. Further confusion results from the fact that practitioners of `factor analysis' do not always have the same definition of the technique (see Jackson, 1981). The definition adopted in this chapter is, however, fairly standard.},

  abstract = {Factor analysis has been one of the most powerful and flexible tools for assessment of multivariate dependence and codependence. Loosely speaking, it could be argued that the origin of its success rests in its very exploratory nature, where various kinds of data-relationships amongst the variables at study can be iteratively verified and/or refuted. Bayesian inference in factor analytic models has received renewed attention in recent years, partly due to computational advances but also partly to applied focuses generating factor structures as exemplified by recent work in financial time series modeling. The focus of our current work is on exploring questions of uncertainty about the number of latent factors in a multivariate factor model, combined with methodological and computational issues of model specification and model fitting. We explore reversible jump MCMC methods that build on sets of parallel Gibbs sampling-based analyses to generate suitable empirical proposal distributions and that address the challenging problem of finding efficient proposals in high-dimensional models. Alternative MCMC methods based on bridge sampling are discussed, and these fully Bayesian MCMC approaches are compared with a collection of popular model selection methods in empirical studies. Various additional computational issues are discussed, including situations where prior information is scarce, and the methods are explored in studies of some simulated data sets and an econometric time series example.},

Such events drive important transitions in social systems (e.g., banking collapses) and physical systems (e.g., earthquakes), and yet it remains unclear the extent to which ecological population numbers buffer or suffer from such extremes. Here, we estimate the prevalence and direction of black-swan events (heavy-tailed process noise) in 609 animal populations after accounting for population dynamics (productivity, density dependence, and typical stochasticity). We find strong evidence for black-swan events in $\sim\sim$$<$mml:math xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"$>$$\sim$$<$/mml:mo$>$$<$/mml:math$>$4\% of populations. These events occur most frequently for birds (7\%), mammals (5\%), and insects (3\%) and are not explained by any life-history covariates but tend to be driven by external perturbations such as climate, severe winters, predators, parasites, or the combined effect of multiple factors. Black-swan events manifest primarily as population die-offs and crashes (86\%) rather than unexpected increases, and ignoring heavy-tailed process noise leads to an underestimate in the magnitude of population crashes. We suggest modelers consider heavy-tailed, downward-skewed probability distributions, such as the skewed Student tt$<$mml:math xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"$>$t$<$/mml:mi$>$$<$/mml:math$>$ used here, when making forecasts of population abundance.

   abstract = {Stan is a probabilistic programming language for specifying statistical models. A Stan program imperatively defines a log probability function over parameters conditioned on specified data and constants. As of version 2.14.0, Stan provides full Bayesian inference for continuous-variable models through Markov chain Monte Carlo methods such as the No-U-Turn sampler, an adaptive form of Hamiltonian Monte Carlo sampling. Penalized maximum likelihood estimates are calculated using optimization methods such as the limited memory Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno algorithm. Stan is also a platform for computing log densities and their gradients and Hessians, which can be used in alternative algorithms such as variational Bayes, expectation propagation, and marginal inference using approximate integration. To this end, Stan is set up so that the densities, gradients, and Hessians, along with intermediate quantities of the algorithm such as acceptance probabilities, are easily accessible. Stan can be called from the command line using the cmdstan package, through R using the rstan package, and through Python using the pystan package. All three interfaces support sampling and optimization-based inference with diagnostics and posterior analysis. rstan and pystan also provide access to log probabilities, gradients, Hessians, parameter transforms, and specialized plotting.},

  abstract = {This article surveys work on a class of models, dynamic factor models (DFMs), that has received considerable attention in the past decade because of their ability to model simultaneously and consistently data sets in which the number of series exceeds the number of time series observations. The aim of this survey is to describe the key theoretical results, applications, and empirical findings in the recent literature on DFMs. The article is organized as follows. The first issue at hand for the econometrician is to estimate the factors and to ascertain how many factors there are; these two topics are covered in Sections 2 and 3. Once one has reliable estimates of the factors, there are a number of things one can do with them beyond using them for forecasting, including using them as instrumental variables, estimating factor-augmented vector autoregressions, and estimating dynamic stochastic general equilibrium models; these applications are covered in Section 4. Section 5 discusses some extensions.},

  abstract = {We consider a set of minimal identification conditions for dynamic factor models. These conditions have economic interpretations and require fewer restrictions than the static factor framework. Under these restrictions, a standard structural vector autoregression (SVAR) with measurement errors can be embedded into a dynamic factor model. More generally, we also consider overidentification restrictions to achieve efficiency. We discuss general linear restrictions, either in the form of known factor loadings or cross-equation restrictions. We further consider serially correlated idiosyncratic errors with heterogeneous dynamics. A numerically stable Bayesian algorithm for the dynamic factor model with general parameter restrictions is constructed for estimation and inference. We show that a square-root form of the Kalman filter improves robustness and accuracy when sampling the latent factors. Confidence intervals (bands) for the parameters of interest such as impulse responses are readily computed. Similar identification conditions are also exploited for multilevel factor models, and they allow us to study the ``spill-over'' effects of the shocks arising from one group to another. Supplementary materials for technical details are available online.},

Carroll's criterion and the quartimax criterion are briefly reviewed; the varimax criterion is outlined in detail and contrasted both logically and numerically with the quartimax criterion. It is shown that thenormal varimax solution probably coincides closely to the application of the principle of simple structure. However, it is proposed that the ultimate criterion of a rotational procedure is factorial invariance, not simple structure\textemdash{}although the two notions appear to be highly related. The normal varimax criterion is shown to be a two-dimensional generalization of the classic Spearman case, i.e., it shows perfect factorial invariance for two pure clusters. An example is given of the invariance of a normal varimax solution for more than two factors. The oblique normal varimax criterion is stated. A computational outline for the orthogonal normal varimax is appended.},

  volume = {6},
  shorttitle = {Spatial Factor Analysis},
  doi = {10.1111/2041-210X.12359},
  abstract = {* Predicting and explaining the distribution and density of species is one of the oldest concerns in ecology. Species distributions can be estimated using geostatistical methods, which estimate a latent spatial variable explaining observed variation in densities, but geostatistical methods may be imprecise for species with low densities or few observations. Additionally, simple geostatistical methods fail to account for correlations in distribution among species and generally estimate such cross-correlations as a post hoc exercise.

* We therefore present spatial factor analysis (SFA), a spatial model for estimating a low-rank approximation to multivariate data, and use it to jointly estimate the distribution of multiple species simultaneously. We also derive an analytic estimate of cross-correlations among species from SFA parameters.

* As a first example, we show that distributions for 10 bird species in the breeding bird survey in 2012 can be parsimoniously represented using only five spatial factors. As a second case study, we show that forward prediction of catches for 20 rockfishes (Sebastes spp.) off the U.S. West Coast is more accurate using SFA than analysing each species individually. Finally, we show that single-species models give a different picture of cross-correlations than joint estimation using SFA.

* Spatial factor analysis complements a growing list of tools for jointly modelling the distribution of multiple species and provides a parsimonious summary of cross-correlation without requiring explicit declaration of habitat variables. We conclude by proposing future research that would model species cross-correlations using dissimilarity of species' traits, and the development of spatial dynamic factor analysis for a low-rank approximation to spatial time-series data.},

  doi = {10.1016/j.csda.2010.09.020},
  abstract = {This paper introduces a new class of spatio-temporal models for measurements belonging to the exponential family of distributions. In this new class, the spatial and temporal components are conditionally independently modeled via a latent factor analysis structure for the (canonical) transformation of the measurements mean function. The factor loadings matrix is responsible for modeling spatial variation, while the common factors are responsible for modeling the temporal variation. One of the main advantages of our model with spatially structured loadings is the possibility of detecting similar regions associated to distinct dynamic factors. We also show that the new class outperforms a large class of spatial-temporal models that are commonly used in the literature. Posterior inference for fixed parameters and dynamic latent factors is performed via a custom tailored Markov chain Monte Carlo scheme for multivariate dynamic systems that combines extended Kalman filter-based Metropolis\textendash{}Hastings proposal densities with block-sampling schemes. Factor model uncertainty is also fully addressed by a reversible jump Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm designed to learn about the number of common factors. Three applications, two based on synthetic Gamma and Bernoulli data and one based on real Bernoulli data, are presented in order to illustrate the flexibility and generality of the new class of models, as well as to discuss features of the proposed MCMC algorithm.},

  abstract = {Parameters in time series and other dynamic models often show complex range restrictions and their distributions may deviate substantially from multivariate normal or other standard parametric distributions. We use the truncated Dirichlet process (DP) as a non-parametric prior for such dynamic parameters in a novel nonlinear Bayesian dynamic factor analysis model. This is equivalent to specifying the prior distribution to be a mixture distribution composed of an unknown number of discrete point masses (or clusters). The stick-breaking prior and the blocked Gibbs sampler are used to enable efficient simulation of posterior samples. Using a series of empirical and simulation examples, we illustrate the flexibility of the proposed approach in approximating distributions of very diverse shapes.},
