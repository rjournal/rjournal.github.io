Main function ,Description
lucid() ,"Main function to fit LUCID models, specified by giving integrated data, a distribution of the outcome and the type of the LUCID model (early, parallel, serial). It also conducts model selection and variable selection for LUCID early integration and model selection for candidate models with different numbers of latent clusters for LUCID in parallel and LUCID in serial."
summary() ,S3 method for LUCID. Create tables to summarize a LUCID model.
plot() ,S3 method for LUCID. Visualize LUCID models through a Sankey diagram.
boot_lucid() ,Derive confidence intervals based on bootstrap resampling.
predict_lucid() ,Predict latent cluster assignment and outcome using integrated data.
Workhorse function ,Description
estimate_lucid() ,Fit a LUCID model to estimate latent clusters by using integrated data.
tune_lucid() ,It fits a series of LUCID models over different combinations of tuning parameters and determines an optimal model with the minimum BIC.
