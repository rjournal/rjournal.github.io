abstract = {zoo is an R package providing an S3 class with methods for indexed totally ordered observations, such as discrete irregular time series. Its key design goals are independence of a particular index/time/date class and consistency with base R and the "ts" class for regular time series. This paper describes how these are achieved within zoo and provides several illustrations of the available methods for "zoo" objects which include plotting, merging and binding, several mathematical operations, extracting and replacing data and index, coercion and NA handling. A subclass "zooreg" embeds regular time series into the "zoo" framework and thus bridges the gap between regular and irregular time series classes in R.},

abstract = {Our current implementation of the Fan Chart follows the original Britton Fisher and Whitley [2] and Blix and Sellin [1] proposal in which the inputs enter at the fourth and ninth quarters and are distributed within the forecasting horizon according to pre established weights. This procedure does not allow enough flexibility to control the shape of the distribution at the shorter end of the horizon when more reliable information is available. On the other hand, no published material presents the details of the Fan Chart computation. In this note all the technical details of the new implementation are described. This implementation provides more flexibility than the previous one since it permits the inputs to be entered on a quarterly basis instead of on a yearly basis.
