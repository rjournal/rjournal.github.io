Motivating letter


Dear editor,


The paper I submit is based on a presentation and workshop given at the uRos 2021 conference where
presenters were invited to submit their work to the R Journal. The paper describes the reclin2
package which provides a toolkit for probabilistic record linkage and deduplication. 

The paper is, I believe, of interest to the R Journal for two main reasons.  First the package is
developed as a toolkit and has a strong focus on flexiblity and extensibility.  The way this has
been achieved is, I believe, of interest to readers of the R Journal. The package uses simple data
structures and simple interfaces and tries to follow as close a possible common interfaces present
in R. The code data structure of the package is basically a data.table that can easily be
manipulated by the user of by functions not present in the reclin2 package. Record linkage models
are estimated using the common modelling interface (e.g. model <- problink_em(formula, data) and
predict(model, newdata=)). This makes it easy to use other existing models next to the models
present in the package.  Second, in the paper a comparison is made to two (not counting the original
reclin package) other packages for generic record link linkage (the only other packages I am aware
of). It includes a benchmark comparing the performance of the packages. 

I hope that you are willing to consider this article for publication in the R Journal.

With kind regards,

Jan van der Laan
