	abstract = {Single-index models are potentially important tools for multivariate nonparametric regression. They generalize linear regression by replacing the linear combination α$_{\textrm{0}}$ $^{\textrm{Tx}}$ with a nonparametric component, η$_{\textrm{0}}$(α$_{\textrm{0}}$ $^{\textrm{T}}$ x), where η$_{\textrm{0}}$(·) is an unknown univariate link function. By reducing the dimensionality from that of a general covariate vector x to a univariate index α$^{\textrm{T}}$$_{\textrm{0}}$ x, single-index models avoid the so-called "curse of dimensionality." We propose penalized spline (P-spline) estimation of η$_{\textrm{0}}$(·) in partially linear single-index models, where the mean function has the form η$_{\textrm{0}}$(α$_{\textrm{0}}$ $^{\textrm{T}}$ x) + β$_{\textrm{0}}$ $^{\textrm{T}}$ z. The P-spline approach offers a number of advantages over other fitting methods for single-index models. All parameters in the P-spline single-index model can be estimated simultaneously by penalized nonlinear least squares. As a direct least squares fitting method, our approach is rapid and computationally stable. Standard nonlinear least squares software can be used. Moreover, joint inference for η$_{\textrm{0}}$(·), α$_{\textrm{0}}$, and β$_{\textrm{0}}$ is possible by standard estimating equations theory such as the sandwich formula for the joint covariance matrix. Using asymptotics where the number of knots is fixed, though potentially large, we show {\textless}tex-math{\textgreater}\${\textbackslash}sqrt n\${\textless}/tex-math{\textgreater} consistency and asymptotic normality of the estimators of all parameters. These asymptotic results permit joint inference for the parameters. Several examples illustrate that the model and proposed estimation methodology can be effective in practice. We investigate inference based on the sandwich estimate through a Monte Carlo study. General L$_{\textrm{q}}$ penalty functions can be readily implemented.},

	abstract = {One of the most difficult problems in applications of semi-parametric partially linear single-index models (PLSIM) is the choice of pilot estimators and complexity parameters which may result in radically different estimators. Pilot estimators are often assumed to be root-n consistent, although they are not given in a constructible way. Complexity parameters, such as a smoothing bandwidth are constrained to a certain speed, which is rarely determinable in practical situations. In this paper, efficient, constructible and practicable estimators of PLSIMs are designed with applications to time series. The proposed technique answers two questions from Carroll et al. [Generalized partially linear single-index models, J. Amer. Statist. Assoc. 92 (1997) 477–489]: no root-n pilot estimator for the single-index part of the model is needed and complexity parameters can be selected at the optimal smoothing rate. The asymptotic distribution is derived and the corresponding algorithm is easily implemented. Examples from real data sets (credit-scoring and environmental statistics) illustrate the technique and the proposed methodology of minimum average variance estimation (MAVE).},

	abstract = {Nonparametric quantile regression with multivariate covariates is a difficult estimation problem due to the “curse of dimensionality”. To reduce the dimensionality while still retaining the flexibility of a nonparametric model, we propose modeling the conditional quantile by a single-index function g0(xTγ0), where a univariate link function g0(⋅) is applied to a linear combination of covariates xTγ0, often called the single-index. We introduce a practical algorithm where the unknown link function g0(⋅) is estimated by local linear quantile regression and the parametric index is estimated through linear quantile regression. Large sample properties of estimators are studied, which facilitate further inference. Both the modeling and estimation approaches are demonstrated by simulation studies and real data applications.},

The proposed plug-in estimator is an extension of the univariate local linear regression estimator of Ruppert, Sheather, and Wand and is shown to achieve the same Op(n-2/7) relative convergence rate for bivariate additive models. If more than two covariates are present, theoretical justification of the method requires independence of the covariates, but simulation experiments show that in practice the method is very robust to violations of this assumption. The proposed bandwidth selection method is compared to cross-validation through simulation experiments. Its practical behavior is demonstrated on a real dataset.},

It can be used to measure the effect of covariates not only in the center of a population, but also in the upper and lower tails. A functional that summarizes key features of the quantile specific relationship between X and Y is the vector βαβα{\textbackslash}beta\_\{{\textbackslash}alpha\} of weighted expected values of the vector of partial derivatives of the quantile function θα(x)θα(x){\textbackslash}theta\_\{{\textbackslash}alpha\}({\textbackslash}mathbf\{x\}). In a nonparametric setting, βαβα{\textbackslash}beta\_\{{\textbackslash}alpha\} can be regarded as a vector of quantile specific nonparametric regression coefficients. In survival analysis models (e.g., Cox's proportional hazard model, proportional odds rate model, accelerated failure time model) and in monotone transformation models used in regression analysis, βαβα{\textbackslash}beta\_\{{\textbackslash}alpha\} gives the direction of the parameter vector in the parametric part of the model. βαβα{\textbackslash}beta\_\{{\textbackslash}alpha\} can also be used to estimate the direction of the parameter vector in semiparametric single index models popular in econometrics. We show that, under suitable regularity conditions, the estimate of βαβα{\textbackslash}beta\_\{{\textbackslash}alpha\} obtained by using the locally polynomial quantile estimate of Chaudhuri (1991a) is n1/2n1/2n{\textasciicircum}\{1/2\}-consistent and asymptotically normal with asymptotic variance equal to the variance of the influence function of the functional βαβα{\textbackslash}beta\_\{{\textbackslash}alpha\}. We discuss how the estimate of βαβα{\textbackslash}beta\_\{{\textbackslash}alpha\} can be used for model diagnostics and in the construction of a link function estimate in general single index models.},

Our aim is to present fully operational versions of both approaches and to show that each works quite well; although either might be used in practice, we have a particular preference for the second. Our automatic smoothing parameter selection method is novel; the main regression quantile smoothing parameters are chosen by rule-of-thumb adaptations of state-of-the-art methods for smoothing parameter selection for regression mean estimation.

Our results are applicable to odd-degree local polynomial fits and can be extended to other settings, such as derivative estimation and multiple nonparametric regression. An implementation in the important case of local linear fits with univariate predictors is shown to perform well in practice.

The resulted estimator of the single-index parametric vector is root-n consistent, asymptotically normal, and based on simulation study, is more efficient than the average derivative method in Chaudhuri, Doksum, and Samarov (1997, Annals of Statistics 19, 760–777). The estimator of the link function converges at the usual rate for nonparametric estimation of a univariate function.
