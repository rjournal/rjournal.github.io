<title>The R Journal: brolgar: An R package to BRowse Over Longitudinal Data Graphically and Analytically in R</title>

<meta property="description" itemprop="description" content="Longitudinal (panel) data provide the opportunity to examine temporal patterns of individuals, because measurements are collected on the same person at different, and often irregular, time points. The data is typically visualised using a &quot;spaghetti plot&quot;, where a line plot is drawn for each individual. When overlaid in one plot, it can have the appearance of a bowl of spaghetti. With even a small number of subjects, these plots are too overloaded to be read easily. The interesting aspects of individual differences are lost in the noise. Longitudinal data is often modelled with a hierarchical linear model to capture the overall trends, and variation among individuals, while accounting for various levels of dependence. However, these models can be difficult to fit, and can miss unusual individual patterns. Better visual tools can help to diagnose longitudinal models, and better capture the individual experiences. This paper introduces the R package, brolgar (BRowse over Longitudinal data Graphically and Analytically in R), which provides tools to identify and summarise interesting individual patterns in longitudinal data."/>

<h1 data-number="1" id="introduction"><span class="header-section-number">1</span> Introduction</h1>
<p>This paper is about exploring longitudinal data effectively. By “longitudinal data” we specifically mean individuals repeatedly measured through time. This could include panel data, where possibly different samples from a key variable (e.g. country), are aggregated at each time collection. The important component is a key variable with repeated measurements regularly, or irregularly over time. The inherent structure allows us to examine temporal patterns of individuals, shown in Figure <a href="#fig:heights-sample-plot">1</a>, of the average height of Australian males over years. The individual component is <code>country</code>, and the time component is <code>year</code>. The variable <code>country</code> along with other variables is measured repeatedly from 1900 to 1970, with irregular intervals between years.</p>

<p>The full dataset of Figure <a href="#fig:heights-sample-plot">1</a> is shown in Figure <a href="#fig:spaghetti">2</a>, showing 144 countries from the year 1700. This plot is challenging to understand because there is overplotting, making it hard to see the individuals. Solutions to this are not always obvious. Showing separate individual plots of each country does not help, as 144 plots is too many to comprehend. Making the lines transparent or fitting a simple model to all the data Figure <a href="#fig:spaghetti">2</a>B, might be a common first step to see common trends. However, all this seems to clarify is: 1) There is a set of some countries that are similar, and they are distributed around the center of the countries, and 2) there is a general upward trend in heights over time. We learn about the collective, but lose sight of the individuals.</p>

<p>This paper demonstrates how to effectively and efficiently explore longitudinal data, using the R package, <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/package=brolgar">brolgar</a>. We examine four problems in exploring longitudinal data:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>How to sample the data</li>
<li>Finding interesting individuals</li>
<li>Finding representative individuals</li>
<li>Understanding a model</li>
</ol>
<p>This paper proceeds in the following way: first, a brief review of existing approaches to longitudinal data, then the definition of longitudinal data, then approaches to these four problems are discussed, followed by a summary.</p>
<h1 data-number="2" id="background"><span class="header-section-number">2</span> Background</h1>
<p>R provides basic time series, <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/package=ts">ts</a>, objects, which are vectors or matrices that represent data sampled at equally spaced points in time. These have been extended through packages such as <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/package=xts">xts</a>, and <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/package=zoo">zoo</a> <span class="citation" data-cites="xts zoo">(<a href="#ref-zoo" role="doc-biblioref">Zeileis and Grothendieck 2005</a>; <a href="#ref-xts" role="doc-biblioref">Ryan and Ulrich 2020</a>)</span>, which only consider data in a wide format with a regular implied time series. These are not appropriate for longitudinal data, which can have indexes that are not time unit oriented, such as “Wave 1…n”, or may contain irregular intervals.</p>
<p>Other packages focus more directly on panel data in R, focussing on data operations and model interfaces. The <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/package=pmdplyr">pmdplyr</a> package provides “Panel Manoeuvres” in <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/package=dplyr">dplyr</a><span class="citation" data-cites="pmdplyr">(<a href="#ref-pmdplyr" role="doc-biblioref">Huntington-Klein and Khor 2020</a>)</span>. It defines the data structure in as a <code>pibble</code> object (<strong>p</strong>anel t<strong>ibble</strong>), requiring an <code>id</code> and <code>group</code> column being defined to identify the unique identifier and grouping. The <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/package=pmdplyr">pmdplyr</a> package focuses on efficient and custom joins and functions, such as <code>inexact_left_join()</code>. It does not implement tidyverse equivalent tools, but instead extends their usecase with a new function, for example <code>mutate_cascade</code> and <code>mutate_subset</code>. The <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/package=panelr">panelr</a> package provides an interface for data reshaping on panel data, providing widening and lengthening functions (<code>widen_panel()</code> and <code>long_panel()</code> <span class="citation" data-cites="panelr">(<a href="#ref-panelr" role="doc-biblioref">Long 2020</a>)</span>). It also provides model facilitating functions by providing its own interface for mixed effects models. The <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/package=plm">plm</a> package <span class="citation" data-cites="plm">(<a href="#ref-plm" role="doc-biblioref">Millo 2017</a>)</span> for panel data econometrics provides methods for estimating models such as GMM for panel data, and testing, for example for model specification or serial correlation. It also provides a data structure, the <code>pdata.frame</code>, which stores the index attribute of the individual and time dimensions, for use within the package’s functions.</p>
<p>These software generally re-implement their own custom panel data class object, as well as custom data cleaning tasks, such as reshaping into long and wide form. They all share similar features, providing some identifying or index variable, and some grouping or key.</p>
<h1 data-number="3" id="longitudinal-data-structures"><span class="header-section-number">3</span> Longitudinal Data Structures</h1>
<p>Longitudinal data is a sibling of many other temporal data forms, including panel data, repeated measures, and time series. The differences are many, and can be in data collection, context and even the field of research. Time series are usually long and regularly spaced in time. Panel data may measure different units at each time point and aggregate these values by a categorical or key variable. Repeated measures typically measure before and after treatment effects. We like to think of longitudinal as measuring the same individual (e.g. wage earner) over time, but this definition is not universally agreed on. Despite the differences, they all share a fundamental similarity: they are measurements over a time period.</p>
<p>This time period has structure - the time component (dates, times, waves, seconds, etc), and the spacing between measurements - unequal or equal. This data structure needs to be respected during analysis to preserve the lowest level of granularity, to avoid for example, collapsing across month when the data is collected every second, or assuming measurements occur at fixed time intervals. These mistakes can be avoided by encoding the data structure into the data itself. This information can then be accessed by analysis tools, providing a consistent way to understand and summarise the data. This ensures the different types of longitudinal data previously mentioned can be handled in the same way.</p>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="building-on-a-tsibble">Building on a tsibble</h2>
<p>Since longitudinal data can be thought of as “individuals repeatedly measured through time”, they can be considered as a type of time series, as defined in <span class="citation" data-cites="fpp">Hyndman and Athanasopoulos (<a href="#ref-fpp" role="doc-biblioref">2018</a>)</span>: “Anything that is observed sequentially over time <strong>is a time series</strong>”. This definition has been realised as a time series <code>tsibble</code> in <span class="citation" data-cites="Wang2020">(<a href="#ref-Wang2020" role="doc-biblioref">Wang et al. 2020</a>)</span>. These objects are defined as data meeting these conditions:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>The <code>index</code>: the time variable</li>
<li>The <code>key</code>: variable(s) defining individual groups (or series)</li>
<li>The <code>index</code> and <code>key</code> (1 + 2) together determine a distinct row</li>
</ol>
<p>If the specified key and index pair do not define a distinct row - for example, if there are duplicates in the data, the <code>tsibble</code> will not be created. This helps ensure the data is properly understood and cleaned before analysis is conducted, removing avoidable errors that might have impacted downstream decisions.</p>
<p>We can formally define our <code>heights</code> data from Figure <a href="#fig:heights-sample-plot">1</a> as a <code>tsibble</code> using, <code>as_tsibble</code>:</p>
<div class="layout-chunk" data-layout="l-body">
<div class="sourceCode">
<pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span><span class='va'>heights_brolgar</span> <span class='op'>&lt;-</span> <span class='fu'>as_tsibble</span><span class='op'>(</span><span class='va'>heights_brolgar</span>,</span>
<span>                      index <span class='op'>=</span> <span class='va'>year</span>,</span>
<span>                      key <span class='op'>=</span> <span class='va'>country</span>,</span>
<span>                      regular <span class='op'>=</span> <span class='cn'>FALSE</span><span class='op'>)</span></span></code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<p>The <code>index</code> is <code>year</code>, the <code>key</code> is <code>country</code>, and <code>regular = FALSE</code> since the intervals in the years measured are not regular. Using a <code>tsibble</code> means that the index and key time series information is recorded only <strong>once</strong>, and can be referred to many times in other parts of the data analysis by time-aware tools.</p>
<p>In addition to providing consistent ways to manipulate time series data, further benefits to building on <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/package=tsibble">tsibble</a> are how it works within the <code>tidyverse</code> ecosystem, as well as the tidy time series packages called “tidyver<strong>ts</strong>”, containing <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/package=fable">fable</a> <span class="citation" data-cites="fable">(<a href="#ref-fable" role="doc-biblioref">O’Hara-Wild et al. 2020a</a>)</span>, <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/package=feasts">feasts</a>, <span class="citation" data-cites="feasts">(<a href="#ref-feasts" role="doc-biblioref">O’Hara-Wild et al. 2020b</a>)</span>. For example, <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/package=tsibble">tsibble</a> provides modified <code>tidyverse</code> functions to explore implicit missing values in the <code>index</code> (e.g., <code>has_gaps()</code> and <code>fill_gaps()</code>), as well as grouping and partitioning based on the index with <code>index_by()</code>. For full details and examples of use with the tidyverts time series packages, see <span class="citation" data-cites="Wang2020">Wang et al. (<a href="#ref-Wang2020" role="doc-biblioref">2020</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/package=brolgar">brolgar</a> package uses <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/package=tsibble">tsibble</a> so users can take advantage of these tools, learning one way of operating a data analysis that will work and have overlap with other contexts.</p>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="characterising-individual-series">Characterising Individual Series</h2>
<h3 class="unnumbered" id="calculating-a-feature">Calculating a feature</h3>
<p>We can summarise the individual series by collapsing their many measurements into a single statistic, such as the minimum, maximum, or median, with one row per key. We do this with the <code>features</code> function from the <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/package=fabletools">fabletools</a> package, made available in <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/package=brolgar">brolgar</a>. This provides a summary of a given variable, accounting for the time series structure, and returning one row per key specified. It can be thought of as a time-series aware variant of the <code>summarise</code> function from <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/package=dplyr">dplyr</a>. The <code>feature</code> function works by specifying the data, the variable to summarise, and the feature to calculate. A template is shown below</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb1"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb1-1"><a href="#cb1-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="fu">features</span>(<span class="sc">&lt;</span>DATA<span class="sc">&gt;</span>, <span class="sc">&lt;</span>VARIABLE<span class="sc">&gt;</span>, <span class="sc">&lt;</span>FEATURE<span class="sc">&gt;</span>)</span></code></pre></div>

<p>For example, to calculate the minimum height for each key (country), in <code>heights</code>, we specify the <code>heights</code> data, then the variable to calculate features on, <code>height_cm</code>, then the feature to calculate, <code>min</code> (we write <code>c(min = min)</code> so the column calculated gets the name “min”):</p>

<p>This takes the <code>heights</code> data, pipes it to <code>features</code>, and then instructs it to summarise the <code>height_cm</code> variable, using <code>feat_five_num</code>. There are several handy functions for calculating features of the data that
<code>brolgar</code> provides. These all start with <code>feat_</code>, and include:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>feat_ranges()</code>: min, max, range difference, interquartile range;</li>
<li><code>feat_spread()</code>: variance, standard deviation, median absolute distance, and interquartile range;</li>
<li><code>feat_monotonic()</code>: is it always increasing, decreasing, or unvarying?;</li>
<li><code>feat_diff_summary()</code>: the summary statistics of the differences amongst a value, including the five number summary, as well as the standard deviation and variance;</li>
<li><code>feat_brolgar()</code>, which will calculate all features available in the <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/package=brolgar">brolgar</a> package.</li>

<p>Here the functions <code>b_</code> are functions with a default of <code>na.rm = TRUE</code>, and in
the cases of quantiles, they use <code>type = 8</code>, and <code>names = FALSE</code>. What is particularly useful is that these will work on any type of time series data, and you can use other more typical time series features from the <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/package=feasts">feasts</a> package, such as autocorrelation, <code>feat_acf()</code> and Seasonal and Trend decomposition using Loess <code>feat_stl()</code> <span class="citation" data-cites="feasts">(<a href="#ref-feasts" role="doc-biblioref">O’Hara-Wild et al. 2020b</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>This demonstrates a workflow that can be used to understand and explore your longitudinal data.

<p>Plots like Figure <a href="#fig:spaghetti">2</a> are often called, “spaghetti plots”, and can be useful for a high level understanding as a whole. However, we cannot process and understand the individuals when the data is presented like this.</p>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="sampling">Sampling</h2>
<p>Just how spaghetti is portioned out for consumption, we can sample some of the data by randomly sampling the data into sub-plots with the <code>facet_sample()</code> function (Figure <a href="#fig:facet-sample">4</a>).</p>

<p>Figure <a href="#fig:facet-sample">4</a> and Figure <a href="#fig:facet-strata">5</a> only show each key once, being randomly assigned to a facet. We can meaningfully place the keys into facets, by arranging the heights “along” a variable, like <code>year</code>, using the <code>along</code> argument in <code>facet_strata</code> to produce Figure <a href="#fig:facet-year-along">6</a>:</p>

<p>We have not lost any of the data, only the order in which they are presented has changed. We learn the distribution and changes in heights over time, and those measured from the earliest times appear to be more similar, but there is much wider variation in the middle years, and then for more recent heights measured from the early 1900s, the heights are more similar. The starting point of each of these years seems to increase at roughly the same interval. This informs us that the starting times of the years is approximately uniform.</p>
<p>Together <code>facet_sample()</code> and <code>facet_strata()</code> allow for rapid exploration, by focusing on relevant questions instead of the minutiae. This is achieved by appropriately randomly assigning while maintaining key structure, keeping the correct number of keys per plot, and so on. For example, <code>facet_sample()</code> the questions are: “How many lines per facet” and “How many facets?”, and for <code>facet_strata()</code> the questions are: “How many facets / strata?” and “What to arrange plots along?”.</p>
<p>Answering these questions keeps the analysis in line with the analytic goals of exploring the data, rather than distracting to minutiae. This is a key theme of improving tools for data analysis. Abstracting away the parts that are not needed, so the analyst can focus on the task at hand.</p>
<p>Under the hood, <code>facet_sample()</code> and <code>facet_strata()</code> are powered with <code>sample_n_keys()</code> and <code>stratify_keys()</code>. These can be used to create data structures used in <code>facet_sample()</code> and <code>facet_strata()</code>, and extend them for other purposes.</p>
<p>Using a <code>tsibble</code> stores important key and index components, in turn allowing for better ways to break up spaghetti plots so we can look at many and all sub-samples using <code>facet_sample()</code> and <code>facet_strata()</code>.</p>
<h1 data-number="5" id="book-keeping"><span class="header-section-number">5</span> Book-keeping</h1>
<p>Longitudinal data is not always measured at the same time and at the same frequency. When exploring longitudinal data, a useful first step is to explore the frequency of measurements of the index. We can check if the index is regular using <code>index_regular()</code> and summarise the spacing of the index with <code>index_summary()</code>. These are S3 methods, so for <code>data.frame</code> objects, the <code>index</code> must be specified, however for the <code>tsibble</code> objects, the defined index is used.</p>

<p>Because we are exploring the temporal patterns, we cannot reliably say anything about those individuals with few measurements. The data used, <code>heights_brolgar</code> has less than 5 measurements. This was done using <code>add_n_obs()</code>, which adds the number of observations to the existing data.

<p>Looking at a spaghetti plot, it can be hard to identify which lines are the most interesting, or unusual. A workflow to identify interesting individuals to start with is given below:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Decide upon an interesting feature (e.g., maximum)</li>
<li>This feature produces one value per key</li>
<li>Examine the distribution of the feature</li>
<li>Join this table back to the data to get all observations for those keys</li>
<li>Arrange the keys or filter, using the feature</li>
<li>Display the data for selected keys</li>
</ol>
<p>This workflow is now demonstrated. Firstly, we <strong>decide on an interesting feature</strong>, “maximum height”, and whether height is always increasing. We calculate our own “feature”, calculating maximum height, and whether a value is increasing (with brolgar’s <code>increasing</code> function) as follows:</p>

<p>These same workflows can be used to interpret and explore a model.

<p>This fits height in centimetres with a smooth effect for year for each country, with a different intercept for each country. It is roughly equivalent to a random intercept varying slope model. Note that this gam model took approximately 8074 seconds to fit. We add the predicted and residual values for the model below, as well as the residual sums of squares for each country.</p>

<p>We can use the previous approach to explore the model results. We can take a look at a sample of the predictions along with the data, by using <code>sample_n_keys</code>. This provides a useful way to explore some set of the model predictions. In order to find those predictions that best summarise the best, and worst, and in between, we need to use the methods in the next section, “Stereotyping”.</p>

<h1 data-number="8" id="stereotyping"><span class="header-section-number">8</span> Stereotyping</h1>
<p>To help understand a population of measurements over time, it can be useful to understand which individual measurements are typical (or “stereotypical”) of a measurement. For example, to understand which individuals are stereotypical of a statistic such as the minimum, median, and maximum height. This section discusses how to find these stereotypes in the data.</p>
<p>Figure <a href="#fig:heights-aug-res-summary">12</a> shows the residuals of the simple model fit to the data in the previous section. There is an overlaid five number summary, showing the minimum, 1st quantile, median, 3rd quantile, and maximum residual value residuals, as well as a rug plot to show the data. We can use these residuals to understand the stereotypes of the data - those individuals in the model that best match to this five number summary.</p>

<p>We can do this using <code>keys_near()</code> from <code>brolgar</code>. By default this uses the 5 number summary, but any function can be used. You specify the variable you want to find the keys nearest, in this case <code>rss</code>, residual sums of squares for each key:</p>

<p>The functions are all designed to build upon existing packages, but are predicated on working with <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/package=tsibble">tsibble</a>. The package extends upon <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/package=ggplot2">ggplot2</a> to provide facets for exploration: <code>facet_sample()</code> and <code>facet_strata()</code>. Extending <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/package=dplyr">dplyr</a>’s <code>sample_n()</code> and <code>sample_frac()</code> functions by providing sampling and stratifying based around keys: <code>sample_n_keys()</code>, <code>sample_frac_keys()</code>, and <code>stratify_keys()</code>. New functions are focussed around the use of <code>key</code>, for example <code>key_slope()</code> to find the slope of each key, and <code>keys_near()</code> to find those keys near a summary statistic. Finally, feature calculation is provided by building upon the existing time series feature package, <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/package=feasts">feasts</a>.</p>
<p>To get started with <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/package=brolgar">brolgar</a> you must first ensure your data is specified as a <code>tsibble</code> - discussed earlier in the paper, there is also a vignette <a href="http://brolgar.njtierney.com/articles/longitudinal-data-structures.html">“Longitudinal Data Structures”</a>, which discusses these ideas. The next step we recommend is sampling some of your data with <code>facet_sample()</code>, and <code>facet_strata()</code>. When using <code>facet_strata()</code>, facets can be arranged in order of a variable, using the <code>along</code> argument, which can reveal interesting features.</p>
<p>To further explore longitudinal data, we recommend finding summary features of each variable with <code>features</code>, and identifying variables that are near summary statistics, using <code>keys_near</code> to find individuals stereotypical of a statistical value.</p>
<h1 data-number="10" id="concluding-remarks"><span class="header-section-number">10</span> Concluding Remarks</h1>
<p>The <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/package=brolgar">brolgar</a> package facilitates exploring longitudinal data in R. It builds upon existing infrastructure from <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/package=tsibble">tsibble</a>, and <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/package=feasts">feasts</a>, which work within the <code>tidyverse</code> family of R packages, as well as the newer, <code>tidyverts</code>, time series packages. Users familiar with either of these package families will find a lot of similarity in their use, and first time users will be able to easily transition from <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/package=brolgar">brolgar</a> to the <code>tidyverse</code> or <code>tidyverts</code>.</p>
<p>Visualizing categorical or binary data over a time period can be difficult as the limited number of values on the y axis leads to overplotting. This can conceal the number of values present at a given value. The tools discussed in <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/package=brolgar">brolgar</a> facilitate this in the form of <code>facet_sample</code>, and <code>facet_strata</code>. Some special methods could be developed to add jitter or noise around these values on the y axis, while still maintaining the graphical axis and tick marks.</p>
<p>Future work will explore more features and stratifications, and stereotypes, and generalise the tools to work for data without time components, and other data types.</p>
