These model estimation techniques are associated with methods for estimating impacts (emanating effects), which are also presented and compared. This review constitutes an up-to-date comparison of generalized method of moments and maximum likelihood implementations now available. The comparison uses the cross-sectional US county data set provided by Drukker, Prucha, and Raciborski (2013d). The comparisons will be cast in the context of alternatives using the MATLAB Spatial Econometrics toolbox, Stata's user-written sppack commands, Python with PySAL and R packages including spdep, sphet and McSpatial.},

Interdependencies between the values of different monitoring sites are characterized by incorporating time-varying anisotropic spatial weighting matrices. These weights are parameterized with respect to wind direction, speed and a range that marks the bandwidth of admissible deviations between wind direction and bearing. The empirical analysis is based on daily values recorded by monitoring sites located across the eastern United States in 2015 as well as several meteorological regressors. More precisely, we propose a space-time dynamic panel data model with different spatial autoregressive, temporal and exogenous dependencies. All model parameters are estimated by the quasi-maximum likelihood approach. The estimation procedure, including the identification of the range and spatial parameters, is verified by Monte Carlo simulations. We show that part of the spatial dependency of values is explained by wind direction.}

That means that the variance in some locations depends on the variance in neighboring locations. In contrast to the temporal ARCH model, for which the distribution is known, given the full information set for the prior periods, the distribution is not straightforward in the spatial and spatiotemporal settings. Thus, we focus on the probability structure of these models. In particular, we derive the conditional and unconditional moments of the process as well as the distribution of the process, given a known error distribution. Eventually, it is shown that the process is strictly stationary under certain conditions.}

Moreover, we introduce characteristic quantities to monitor means or covariances of multivariate spatial autoregressive processes. Additionally, we also take into account the simultaneous surveillance of the mean vector and the covariance matrix. The aim is to apply control charts, important tools of sequential analysis, to these quantities. The considered control procedures are based on either cumulative sums or exponential smoothing. Further, we illustrate the methodology of statistical process control studying the spectrum of additive colors in a satellite photograph. Via simulation studies, the proposed control procedures are calibrated for a predefined average run length. In addition, we compare the performance of the control procedures considering the out-of-control situation. Eventually, the control charts are applied, and the signals of the different schemes are visualized. The final results are critically discussed.}

The price process is spatially autocorrelated and stationary over the considered period from 1995 to 2010. To quantify both spatial and temporal effects of the process, we apply different spatiotemporal models. These models are consistently estimated by the maximum likelihood approach, and they are compared with respect to the impact of shocks on fundamental quantities. Moreover, we interpret the economic importance of our results with respect to migrational issues. We show that the willingness of individuals to move or to commute decreased in Germany during the considered years. Furthermore, we include a detailed interpretation of the so-called ripple effect.}

We analyze whether public expenditures in neighboring municipalities influence local spending decisions within a comprehensive set of expenditure categories. Our analysis is based on panel data covering the universe of Colombian municipalities from 2000 to 2010. We offer a quasi-experimental identification strategy exploiting exogenous variation in municipalities' exposure to changes in the world market price of oil, depending on the municipalities' endowment with oil resources and controlling for municipality fixed effects. While we find evidence of strong spatial autocorrelation of total local public spending as well as in almost all expenditure categories, the quasi-experimental approach reveals that there are no significant causal fiscal interaction effects between municipalities. This highlights the importance of using additional sources of exogenous variation for the identification of fiscal interactions. In the developing country context, our findings suggest that fiscal decentralization policies do not lead to a race to the bottom in local public expenditures.}
