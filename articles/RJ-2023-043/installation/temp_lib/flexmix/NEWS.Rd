  }
}    
\section{Changes in flexmix version 2.3-18}{
  \itemize{
    \item The man page improved for the different general model classes
    such as `\code{FLXM}', `\code{FLXMC}', `\code{FLXMR}' and
    `\code{FLXMCsparse}'. Thanks to Jonas Hagenberg for pointing out
    that the class structure is not well documented.
    \item An issue fixed for `\code{FLXMRlmmc}' models.
  }
}    
\section{Changes in flexmix version 2.3-17}{
  \itemize{
    \item A model class for sparse model-based clustering added with
    a suitable method to resolve the formula and extract the data.
    \item There was a bug with dimensions being dropped if only a single
    individual was used for grouping. Thanks to Adam Hulman for pointing
    this issue out.
    \item The \code{FLXgetModelmatrix} method for `\code{FLXMRlmm}'
    objects has been improved. Thanks to Adam Hulman for pointing
    out that this might be unnecessarily slow.
  }
}    
\section{Changes in flexmix version 2.3-16}{
  \itemize{
    \item The vignette explaining model diagnostics using resampling
    methods was modified to use more replications. Thanks to Eric Book
    for pointing this issue out.
  }
}    
\section{Changes in flexmix version 2.3-15}{
  \itemize{
    \item Modified the internal function \code{groupPosteriors} to be
    more efficient for a large number of groups. Thanks to Marnix Koops
    for pointing the problem out.
    \item Model driver \code{FLXMRlmer()} adapted for \pkg{lme4} (>=
      1.1). Thanks to Mark Senior for pointing the problem out.
    \item Model driver \code{FLXMRmgcv()} adapted for \pkg{mgcv} (>=
      1.8-27). 
    \item Data set \code{Catsup} is now loaded from package \pkg{Ecdat}
      instead of \pkg{mlogit}.
  }
}    
\section{Changes in flexmix version 2.3-14}{
  \itemize{
    \item A bug fixed for \code{FLXMRcondlogit()} to ensure that the
    formula for the strata is also stored and can be used for
    predicting, etc. new data. Thanks to Peter Fraser-Mackenziefor
    for pointing the problem out.
    \item A bug fixed for \code{FLXMRglmfix()} which occurred if several
    components were simultaneously omitted. Thanks to Moritz Berger for
    pointing the problem out.
    \item For mixtures of mixed effects models and with censored data
    only weighted ML estimation is implemented. This is now checked and
    an error is given if a different estimation method is requested.
    \item A generic function \code{sigma()} is available for R >= 3.3.0
    and thus different versions of \code{sigma()} need to be called
    depending on the R version. Thanks also to Stephen Martin for
    pointing the issue out.
    \item Components are now generated using functions instead of
    expressions.
    \item Functions from the base packages \pkg{stats}, \pkg{graphics}
    and \pkg{grDevices} are now correctly imported before being used.
    \item Function \code{FLXMCdist1} implements model drivers for
    univariate mixtures of different distributions.
  }
}
\section{Changes in flexmix version 2.3-13}{
  \itemize{
    \item A model driver for mixtures of regression models with
      (adaptive) lasso and elastic net penalizations for the coefficients
      building on \pkg{glmnet} was provided by Frederic Mortier and

  }
}
\section{Changes in flexmix version 2.3-12}{
  \itemize{
    \item Construction of model matrices changed to re-use levels of
      factors while fitting for prediction. Thanks to Robert Poos for
      pointing the problem out.
    \item Package mgcv of version at least 1.8-0 is required in order
      to avoid loading of the package for formula evaluation.
   }
}
\section{Changes in flexmix version 2.3-11}{
  \itemize{
    \item Examples changed to be less time consuming.
    \item Bug fixed in ungroupPriors() and getPriors() to work with a
      grouping where only one unique value is contained. Thanks to
      Christine Koehler for pointing the problem out.
    \item The \code{logLik()} method for \code{"flexmix"} objects now
      also has a \code{newdata} argument.
    \item In the M-step only the parameters of the previously fitted
      components are passed over to avoid nesting of
      environments. Thanks to Dominik Ernst for pointing the problem
      out.
    \item Function \code{boot()} was fixed to work correctly with
      grouped data if the groups are kept and if fixed effects are
      fitted.

      1.0).
  }
}
\section{Changes in flexmix version 2.3-10}{
  \itemize{
    \item Parallel processing disabled in \code{stepFlexmix()}.
  }
}
\section{Changes in flexmix version 2.3-9}{
  \itemize{
    \item Package dependencies, imports and suggests modified suitably
      for R >= 2.15.0.
    \item NEWS file adapted to a NEWS.Rd file.
    \item Parallel processing is enabled in \code{stepFlexmix()}. See
      \pkg{flexclust} for details.
    \item New model drivers \code{FLXMRmultinom()} and \code{FLXMRcondlogit()} are
      included which allow to fit finite mixtures of multinomial logit
      and conditional logit models. Identifiability problems might arise
      for this model class. Details on sufficient identifiability
      conditions are given in Gruen and Leisch (2008).
    \item A bug in \code{FLXMRlmm()} was fixed which did not allow to specify
      restrictions on the variances of the random effects and / or the
      residuals. Thanks to Gregory Matthews for pointing the problem out.
  }
}
\section{Changes in flexmix version 2.3-8}{
  \itemize{
    \item The fit function in the M-step by default now is called with an
      argument containing the fitted component. This allows to use the
      parameter estimates from the previous step for initialization. Fit
      functions which do not require this now need a \code{...} argument.
      Thanks to Hannah Frick and Achim Zeileis for requesting this
      feature.
    \item Function \code{initFlexmix()} was added which is an alternative to
      \code{stepFlexmix()} where first several short runs of EM, SEM or CEM are
      performed followed by a long run of EM. 
  }
}
\section{Changes in flexmix version 2.3-7}{
  \itemize{
    \item A bug fixed in \code{predict()} and \code{fitted()} if a concomitant variable
      model is specified and \code{aggregate = TRUE}. Thanks to Julia Schiffner
      for pointing this out.
    \item A bug fixed in \code{FLXMRmgcv()} if observations were removed in the
      M-step because their a-posterior probabilities were smaller than
      eps. Thanks to Ghislain Geniaux for pointing the problem out.
  }
}
\section{Changes in flexmix version 2.3-6}{
  \itemize{
    \item Vignettes moved from /inst/doc to /vignettes.
    \item \code{stepFlexmix()} can now be called with a concomitant variable model
      \code{FLXPmultinom()} for \code{k} starting with 1 without getting an error. The
      concomitant variable model is internally replaced by
      \code{FLXPconstant()}.
    \item The \code{boot()} method for \code{"flexmix"} objects is extended to mixture
      models with concomitant variables and mixtures of linear mixed
      models.
    \item A bug fixed in the \code{summary()} method for \code{"flexmix"} objects. The
      column post > 0 did not give the correct results if weights were
      used for fitting the mixture.
    \item A bug fixed in the \code{unique()} method for \code{"stepFlexmix"} objects. This
      only occurred if components were dropped as well as if the EM
      algorithm did not converge for all repetitions. Thanks to
      Sebastian Meyer for pointing this out.
  }
}
\section{Changes in flexmix version 2.3-5}{
  \itemize{
    \item A bug fixed in \code{posterior()}. Fixed priors were always used, also if
      a concomitant variable model was present.
    \item A method added for \code{prior()} such that if newdata is supplied and
      the object is of class \code{"flexmix"} the prior class probabilities for
      each observation are returned.
  }
}
\section{Changes in flexmix version 2.3-4}{
  \itemize{
    \item A generic method for \code{nobs()} is introduced in \pkg{stats4} for \R
      2.13.0. \pkg{flexmix} now does not define this generic function and
      \code{logLik()}, \code{AIC()} and \code{BIC()} methods were modified to better exploit
      already available methods. Thanks to Prof. Brian D. Ripley for
      suggesting the modification.
  }
}
\section{Changes in flexmix version 2.3-3}{
  \itemize{
    \item A bug for \code{boot()} fixed for \code{"flexmix"} objects with an unbalanced 
      grouping variable. Thanks to Laszlo Sandor for pointing this out.
  }
}
\section{Changes in flexmix version 2.3-2}{
  \itemize{

  }
}
\section{Changes in flexmix version 2.2-10}{
  \itemize{
    \item For long formulas \code{FLXMRglmfix()} did not work properly due to the
      splitting of the formula into several parts by \code{deparse()}. This is
      fixed by pasting them together again. Thanks to Dustin Tingley for
      the bug report.
  }
}
\section{Changes in flexmix version 2.2-9}{
  \itemize{
    \item A new model driver \code{FLXMRmgcv()} is added which allows to fit
      regularized linear models in the components.

      other packages.
  }
}
\section{Changes in flexmix version 2.2-8}{

      for \code{FLXfit()} for version 2.2-6 for \code{refit()}.
    \item Bug fixed for FLXfillconcomitant and refit when weights and

      more stable for small likelihoods. Thanks to Nicolas Picard for
      the code patch.

    \item New demo driver \code{FLXMCnorm1()} for univariate Gaussian clustering.
    \item Non-postive values for the maximum number of iterations for the
      \code{"FLXcontrol"} object are not valid. A validity check for this is

}
\section{Changes in flexmix version 2.2-5}{
  \itemize{
    \item Model class \code{"FLXMRfix"} introduced which is a subclass
      of \code{"FLXMR"} and a superclass for \code{"FLXMRglmfix"} which also
      extends \code{"FLXMRglm"}.
