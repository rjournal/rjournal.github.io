Changes in mixtools 2.0.0
============================
* 2022-12-05

* Updates included in this major release were due to funding received from the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative: Essential Open Source Software for Science (Grant No. 2020-255193).  This has been added to both the DESCRIPTION file and the zzz.R file.

* Updated all graphics functions to use plotly.  These new functions are prefaced by "plotly_".  All of the original plotting functions that used base R graphics are still included in order to maintain backwards compatibility.

* Launched a GitHub repo for mixtools, which has been added to DESCRIPTION.  Bug requests can be submitted through the repo.

* Modified the NAMESPACE to import the necessary functions from the scales package as well as export all of the newly-created plotly graphics functions.

* Modified the summary.mixEM() function to fix some output inconsistencies when analyzing results from mvnormalmixEM().

* Changed conditional tests for the class of certain objects to use the inherits() function.  The affected functions are boot.comp(), boot.se(), gammamixEM(), and segremixEM().

* Generalized the regmixEM.loc() and lambda() functions to allow multiple predictors.  The previous versions only accepted a single predictor even though the documentation mistakenly indicated multiple predictors.  The revised functions use a product kernel in the calculation if inputting multiple predictors.  Thanks to Julio Trecenti for pointing this out.

* Updated links to URLs found in various .Rd files and the CITATION file.

* Added Kedai Cheng (UNC - Asheville) as an author of the package.

* Resolved issues noted on CRAN regarding escaped LaTeX specials in certain .Rd files. 


Changes in mixtools 1.2.0
============================
* 2020-02-05

* Fixed compatibility issues with R 4.0.0.

* Modified the NAMESPACE to only import three functions from the kernlab package: kpca(), pcv(), and Q().

* Modified gammamixEM() to reflect the developments in Young, Chen, Hewage, and Nilo-Poyanco (2019).  This includes the addition of the argument mom.start to use a method-of-moments starting value strategy, as well as the addition of the fix.alpha argument for estimating a common shape parameter across the different components.

* Added the mixturegram() function to construct mixturegrams for determining the number of components, which was introduced by Young, Ke, and Zeng (2018).

* Modified the way the mixing proportions were randomly generated in the poisregmix.init() and logisregmix.init() functions.  Previously, there was the possibility of generating too small of a mixing component, which could cause numerical instabilities.  Thanks to Xiaoqiong Fang for identifying this issue.


Changes in mixtools 1.1.0
============================
* 2017-03-10

* Properly registered native routines for internal C code to conform with R-devel checks.

* Fixed some inconsistencies with the S3 methods used.

* Added tauequivnormalmixEM() to search for a local maximum of the likelihood surface for a univariate finite mixture of normals with possible equality constraints on the stdev parameters.

* Added expRMM_EM() for fitting univariate finite mixtures-of-exponentials with right censoring.  Some associated distribution functions for this calculation were also added.

* Added weibullRMM_SEM(), which is a stochastic EM algorithm for estimating Reliability Mixture Models (RMM) with censoring.

* Added spRMM_SEM(), which is a stochastic EM algorithm for estimating a semiparametric Scaling RMM with censoring.

* Corrected an issue with loading WaterdataFull.

* Removed dependency on 'boot' package and revised code in the appropriate functions.  Thanks to Tim Hesterberg and Karl Millar of Google for this suggestion.

* Updated some help files.


Changes in mixtools 1.0.4
============================
* 2016-01-11

* Added mvnpEM() and some related functions, which are multivariate blocks extension to the npEM() function.

* Updated some help files.


Changes in mixtools 1.0.3
============================
* 2015-04-17

* Updated the maintainer's contact e-mail.

* Added a new npMSL() version, with k-fold cross-validation.

* Fixed some errors in the examples due to change in format to the Waterdata dataset.

* Updated some references.


Changes in mixtools 1.0.2
============================
* 2014-05-13

* Fixed an indexing error in the boot.comp() function.

* Updated some references.


Changes in mixtools 1.0.1
============================
* 2014-01-01

* Fixed a small bug to the boot.comp() function.

* Added more complete version of Waterdata dataset, which includes all 579 children originally measured along with age and sex information


Changes in mixtools 1.0.0 
============================
* 2013-10-05

* Started a NEWS file as of this version. New capabilities include:

* A normalmixMMlc() function was added, for mixtures of univariate Normals with linear constraints on both the means and the variances parameters, requiring a MM-type algorithm.

* A spEMsymlocN01() function was added, implementing a specific semiparametric EM-like algorithm for univariate mixture in False Discovery Rate (FDR) estimation, in which setup one component is known and set to the standard normal whereas the second component is semiparametric. Functions for plotting the results from this algorithm and for FDR estimation from its output have also been added.

* Some documentation (Rd) files have been updated for examples, and some reference papers in EM-related Rd files have been updated.
