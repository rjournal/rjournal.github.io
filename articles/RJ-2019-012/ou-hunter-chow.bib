They do not seem to understand the relationship between times series models and discrete time (stochastic) differential equations, whereas Anderson (1963) does. on page 422 they note how {"}it is not very satisfying to account for continuity in a process variable at the manifest level simply by relating its current values to its previous values.{"}, but then suggest dealing with latent variables will be more satisfying. to me this echos similar feelings about the inadequacy of time series models with respect to interpretation: they are not inherently dynamically meaningful. However, once the time series models can be interpreted at differential equations, then I think we have something!},
