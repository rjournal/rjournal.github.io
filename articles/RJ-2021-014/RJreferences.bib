  abstract = {Humans are exposed to a large number of environmental chemicals: Some of these may be toxic, and many others have unknown or poorly characterized health effects. There is intense interest in determining the impact of exposure to environmental chemical mixtures on human health. As the study of mixtures continues to evolve in the field of environmental epidemiology, it is imperative that we understand the methodologic challenges of this research and the types of questions we can address using epidemiological data. In this article, we summarize some of the unique challenges in exposure assessment, statistical methods, and methodology that epidemiologists face in addressing chemical mixtures. We propose three broad questions that epidemiological studies can address: a) What are the potential health impacts of individual chemical agents? b) What is the interaction among agents? And c) what are the health effects of cumulative exposure to multiple agents? As the field of mixtures research grows, we can use these three questions as a basis for defining our research questions and for developing methods that will help us better understand the effect of chemical exposures on human disease and well-being.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Adequate maternal thyroid function during pregnancy is necessary for normal fetal brain development, making pregnancy a critical window of vulnerability to thyroid disrupting insults. Sodium/iodide symporter (NIS) inhibitors, namely perchlorate, nitrate, and thiocyanate, have been shown individually to competitively inhibit uptake of iodine by the thyroid. Several epidemiologic studies examined the association between these individual exposures and thyroid function. Few studies have examined the effect of this chemical mixture on thyroid function during pregnancy
OBJECTIVES: We examined the cross sectional association between urinary perchlorate, thiocyanate and nitrate concentrations and thyroid function among healthy pregnant women living in New York City using weighted quantile sum (WQS) regression.
METHODS: We measured thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) and free thyroxine (FreeT4) in blood samples; perchlorate, thiocyanate, nitrate and iodide in urine samples collected from 284 pregnant women at 12 ({$\pm$}2.8) weeks gestation. We examined associations between urinary analyte concentrations and TSH or FreeT4 using linear regression or WQS adjusting for gestational age, urinary iodide and creatinine.
RESULTS: Individual analyte concentrations in urine were significantly correlated (Spearman's r 0.4-0.5, p{$<$}0.001). Linear regression analyses did not suggest associations between individual concentrations and thyroid function. The WQS revealed a significant positive association between the weighted sum of urinary concentrations of the three analytes and increased TSH. Perchlorate had the largest weight in the index, indicating the largest contribution to the WQS.
CONCLUSIONS: Co-exposure to perchlorate, nitrate and thiocyanate may alter maternal thyroid function, specifically TSH, during pregnancy.},

  abstract = {Quantitative measurements of environmental factors greatly improve the quality of epidemiologic studies but can pose challenges because of the presence of upper or lower detection limits or interfering compounds, which do not allow for precise measured values. We consider the regression of an environmental measurement (dependent variable) on several covariates (independent variables). Various strategies are commonly employed to impute values for interval-measured data, including assignment of one-half the detection limit to nondetected values or of ``fill-in'' values randomly selected from an appropriate distribution. On the basis of a limited simulation study, we found that the former approach can be biased unless the percentage of measurements below detection limits is small (5\textendash{}10\%). The fill-in approach generally produces unbiased parameter estimates but may produce biased variance estimates and thereby distort inference when 30\% or more of the data are below detection limits. Truncated data methods (e.g., Tobit regression) and multiple imputation offer two unbiased approaches for analyzing measurement data with detection limits. If interest resides solely on regression parameters, then Tobit regression can be used. If individualized values for measurements below detection limits are needed for additional analysis, such as relative risk regression or graphical display, then multiple imputation produces unbiased estimates and nominal confidence intervals unless the proportion of missing data is extreme. We illustrate various approaches using measurements of pesticide residues in carpet dust in control subjects from a case\textendash{}control study of non-Hodgkin lymphoma.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: There are several suspected environmental risk factors for non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL). The associations between NHL and environmental chemical exposures have typically been evaluated for individual chemicals (i.e., one-by-one).
OBJECTIVES: We determined the association between a mixture of 27 correlated chemicals measured in house dust and NHL risk.
METHODS: We conducted a population-based case-control study of NHL in four National Cancer Institute-Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results centers--Detroit, Michigan; Iowa; Los Angeles County, California; and Seattle, Washington--from 1998 to 2000. We used weighted quantile sum (WQS) regression to model the association of a mixture of chemicals and risk of NHL. The WQS index was a sum of weighted quartiles for 5 polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), 7 polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), and 15 pesticides. We estimated chemical mixture weights and effects for study sites combined and for each site individually, and also for histologic subtypes of NHL.
RESULTS: The WQS index was statistically significantly associated with NHL overall [odds ratio (OR) = 1.30; 95\% CI: 1.08, 1.56; p = 0.006; for one quartile increase] and in the study sites of Detroit (OR = 1.71; 95\% CI: 1.02, 2.92; p = 0.045), Los Angeles (OR = 1.44; 95\% CI: 1.00, 2.08; p = 0.049), and Iowa (OR = 1.76; 95\% CI: 1.23, 2.53; p = 0.002). The index was marginally statistically significant in Seattle (OR = 1.39; 95\% CI: 0.97, 1.99; p = 0.071). The most highly weighted chemicals for predicting risk overall were PCB congener 180 and propoxur. Highly weighted chemicals varied by study site; PCBs were more highly weighted in Detroit, and pesticides were more highly weighted in Iowa.
CONCLUSIONS: An index of chemical mixtures was significantly associated with NHL. Our results show the importance of evaluating chemical mixtures when studying cancer risk.},

However, due to the high dimensionality and inherent correlations among chemicals that occur together, the traditional methods (e.g. ordinary or logistic regression) suffer from collinearity and variance inflation, and shrinkage methods have limitations in selecting among correlated components. We propose a weighted quantile sum (WQS) approach to estimating a body burden index, which identifies ``bad actors'' in a set of highly correlated environmental chemicals. We evaluate and characterize the accuracy of WQS regression in variable selection through extensive simulation studies through sensitivity and specificity (i.e., ability of the WQS method to select the bad actors correctly and not incorrect ones). We demonstrate the improvement in accuracy this method provides over traditional ordinary regression and shrinkage methods (lasso, adaptive lasso, and elastic net). Results from simulations demonstrate that WQS regression is accurate under some environmentally relevant conditions, but its accuracy decreases for a fixed correlation pattern as the association with a response variable diminishes. Nonzero weights (i.e., weights exceeding a selection threshold parameter) may be used to identify bad actors; however, components within a cluster of highly correlated active components tend to have lower weights, with the sum of their weights representative of the set.Supplementary materials accompanying this paper appear on-line.},

  abstract = {In evaluation of cancer risk related to environmental chemical exposures, the effect of many chemicals on disease is ultimately of interest. However, because of potentially strong correlations among chemicals that occur together, traditional regression methods suffer from collinearity effects, including regression coefficient sign reversal and variance inflation. In addition, penalized regression methods designed to remediate collinearity may have limitations in selecting the truly bad actors among many correlated components. The recently proposed method of weighted quantile sum (WQS) regression attempts to overcome these problems by estimating a body burden index, which identifies important chemicals in a mixture of correlated environmental chemicals. Our focus was on assessing through simulation studies the accuracy of WQS regression in detecting subsets of chemicals associated with health outcomes (binary and continuous) in site-specific analyses and in non-site-specific analyses. We also evaluated the performance of the penalized regression methods of lasso, adaptive lasso, and elastic net in correctly classifying chemicals as bad actors or unrelated to the outcome. We based the simulation study on data from the National Cancer Institute Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results Program (NCI-SEER) case\textendash{}control study of non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) to achieve realistic exposure situations. Our results showed that WQS regression had good sensitivity and specificity across a variety of conditions considered in this study. The shrinkage methods had a tendency to incorrectly identify a large number of components, especially in the case of strong association with the outcome.},

This measure can be computed for all parameters in the model, and it communicates the relative loss of efficiency in the estimation of a particular parameter due to missing data. It has been recommended that researchers working with incomplete data sets routinely report this measure, as it is more informative than percent missing data (Bodner, 2008; Schafer, 1997). However, traditional estimates of \$\textbackslash{}delta\_j\$  require the implementation of multiple imputation (MI). Many researchers prefer to fit structural equation models using full information maximum likelihood rather than MI. This article demonstrates how to obtain an estimate of \$\textbackslash{}delta\_j\$  using maximum likelihood estimation routines only and argues that this estimate is superior to the estimate obtained via MI when the number of imputations is small. Interpretation of \$\textbackslash{}delta\_j\$ is also addressed.},

  abstract = {DELETE ME IF CREATINB BIBTEX FILE:    In his 1987 classic book on multiple imputation (MI), Rubin used the fraction of missing information, \textbackslash{}gamma, to define the relative efficiency (RE) of MI as RE = (1 + \textbackslash{}gamma/m)\^a1/2, where m is the number of imputations, leading to the conclusion that a small m  would be sufficient for MI. However, evidence has been accumulating that many more imputations are needed. Why would the apparently sufficient m deduced from the RE be actually too small? The answer may lie with \textbackslash{}gamma. In this research, \textbackslash{}gamma was determined at the fractions of missing data (\textbackslash{}delta) of 4\textbackslash\%, 10\textbackslash\%, 20\textbackslash\%, and 29\textbackslash\% using the 2012 Physician Workflow Mail Survey of the National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey (NAMCS). The \textbackslash{}gamma values were strikingly small, ranging in the order of 10\^6 to 0.01. As \textbackslash{}delta increased, \textbackslash{}gamma usually increased but sometimes decreased. How the data were analysed had the dominating effects on \^I{$^3$}, overshadowing the effect of \textbackslash{}delta. The results suggest that it is impossible to predict \textbackslash{}gamma using \textbackslash{}delta and that it may not be appropriate to use the \^I{$^3$}-based RE to determine sufficient m.\vphantom\{\}},

  abstract = {Socioeconomic status (SES) is often considered a risk factor for health outcomes. SES is typically measured using individual variables of educational attainment, income, housing, and employment variables or a composite of these variables. Approaches to building the composite variable include using equal weights for each variable or estimating the weights with principal components analysis or factor analysis. However, these methods do not consider the relationship between the outcome and the SES variables when constructing the index. In this project, we used weighted quantile sum (WQS) regression to estimate an area-level SES index and its effect in a model of colonoscopy screening adherence in the Minnesota-Wisconsin Metropolitan Statistical Area. We considered several specifications of the SES index including using different spatial scales (e.g., census block group-level, tract-level) for the SES variables. We found a significant positive association (odds ratio = 1.17, 95\% CI: 1.15-1.19) between the SES index and colonoscopy adherence in the best fitting model. The model with the best goodness-of-fit included a multi-scale SES index with 10 variables at the block group-level and one at the tract-level, with home ownership, race, and income among the most important variables. Contrary to previous index construction, our results were not consistent with an assumption of equal importance of variables in the SES index when explaining colonoscopy screening adherence. Our approach is applicable in any study where an SES index is considered as a variable in a regression model and the weights for the SES variables are not known in advance.},

 Consider c correlated components reasonable to combine into an index but are interval-censored between 0 and some positive number (henceforth, the detection limit). The miWQS package applies the multiple imputation (MI) procedure to the weighted quantile sum regression (WQS) methodology for continuous, binary, or count outcomes.  In summary, MI consists of three stages: (1) imputation, (2) analysis, and (3) pooling. First,  the missing values are imputed by bootstrapping (Lubin et.al (2004) {$<$}doi:10.1289/ehp.7199{$>$}) , Bayesian imputation, or placing the below the detection limits in the first quantile (BDLQ1) (Ward et.al. (2014) {$<$}doi:10.1289/ehp.1307602{$>$}) . Second, the estimate.wqs() implements WQS regression if the components are complete, imputed, or missing (Carrico et.al. (2014) {$<$}doi:10.1007/s13253-014-0180-3{$>$}) . If the data is missing, BDLQ1 is automatically implemented.  Lastly, the pool.mi() calculates the pooled statistics according to Rubin's rules (Rubin 1987).},

  abstract = {Simultaneous exposure to a mixture of chemicals over a lifetime may increase an individual's risk of disease. Weighted quantile sum (WQS) regression estimates the effect of exposure to chemicals and identifies the important, or the key etiologically-relevant, components in the mixture. However, complications arise when experimental apparatus can only detect chemical concentrations to a detection limit. Strategies to account for the values below the detection limit (BDL) in WQS analyses are limiting. Researchers may place BDLs into the first quantile of the weighted index (BDLQ1) or perform bootstrapping or Bayesian imputation. We propose integrating WQS regression into the multiple imputation (MI) framework and to compare these approaches via a simulation study over a range of values BDL. We examined the ability of each method to estimate the mixture effect and to identify important chemicals.  As expected, as the number of values BDL increases, the accuracy, precision, model fit, and power decline. When chemical values are missing at 10\%, 33\%, or 50\%, imputation methods performed better than single imputation and BDLQ1; however, when 80\% of the chemical values are missing, the BDLQ1 approach is the best.},

In this study, we further extended the GMIFS method for ordinal response modeling using a complementary log-log link, which allows one to model discrete survival data. We applied our extension to a publicly available microarray gene expression dataset (GSE53733) with a discrete survival outcome. The dataset included 70 primary glioblastoma samples from patients of the German Glioma Network with long-, intermediate-, and short-term overall survival. We tested the performance of our method by examining the prediction accuracy of the fitted model.
