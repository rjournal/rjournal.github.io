 abstract = {X-12-ARIMA is the Census Bureau's new seasonal-adjustment program. It provides four types of enhancements to X-11-ARIMA--(1) alternative seasonal, trading-day, and holiday effect adjustment capabilities that include adjustments for effects estimated with user-defined regressors; additional seasonal and trend filter options; and an alternative seasonal-trend-irregular decomposition; (2) new diagnostics of the quality and stability of the adjustments achieved under the options selected; (3) extensive time series modeling and model-selection capabilities for linear regression models with ARIMA errors, with optional robust estimation of coefficients; (4) a new user interface with features to facilitate batch processing large numbers of series.},

 ISSN = {07350015},

 abstract = {Several important economic time series are recorded on a particular day every week. Seasonal adjustment of such series is difficult because the number of weeks varies between 52 and 53 and the position of the recording day changes from year to year. In addition certain festivals, most notably Easter, take place at different times according to the year. This article presents a solution to problems of this kind by setting up a structural time series model that allows the seasonal pattern to evolve over time and enables trend extraction and seasonal adjustment to be carried out by means of state-space filtering and smoothing algorithms. The method is illustrated with a Bank of England series on the money supply.},
