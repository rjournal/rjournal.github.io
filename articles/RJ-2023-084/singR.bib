abstract = {Collection of multiple-task brain imaging data from the same subject has now become common practice in medical imaging studies. In this paper, we propose a simple yet effective model, “CCA+ICA”, as a powerful tool for multi-task data fusion. This joint blind source separation (BSS) model takes advantage of two multivariate methods: canonical correlation analysis and independent component analysis, to achieve both high estimation accuracy and to provide the correct connection between two datasets in which sources can have either common or distinct between-dataset correlation. In both simulated and real fMRI applications, we compare the proposed scheme with other joint BSS models and examine the different modeling assumptions. The contrast images of two tasks: sensorimotor (SM) and Sternberg working memory (SB), derived from a general linear model (GLM), were chosen to contribute real multi-task fMRI data, both of which were collected from 50 schizophrenia patients and 50 healthy controls. When examining the relationship with duration of illness, CCA+ICA revealed a significant negative correlation with temporal lobe activation. Furthermore, CCA+ICA located sensorimotor cortex as the group-discriminative regions for both tasks and identified the superior temporal gyrus in SM and prefrontal cortex in SB as task-specific group-discriminative brain networks. In summary, we compared the new approach to some competitive methods with different assumptions, and found consistent results regarding each of their hypotheses on connecting the two tasks. Such an approach fills a gap in existing multivariate methods for identifying biomarkers from brain imaging data.}

abstract = {Examining task-free functional connectivity (FC) in the human brain offers insights on how spontaneous integration and segregation of information relate to human cognition, and how this organization may be altered in different conditions, and neurological disorders. This is particularly relevant for patients in disorders of consciousness (DOC) following severe acquired brain damage and coma, one of the most devastating conditions in modern medical care. We present a novel data-driven methodology, connICA, which implements Independent Component Analysis (ICA) for the extraction of robust independent FC patterns (FC-traits) from a set of individual functional connectomes, without imposing any a priori data stratification into groups. We here apply connICA to investigate associations between network traits derived from task-free FC and cognitive/clinical features that define levels of consciousness. Three main independent FC-traits were identified and linked to consciousness-related clinical features. The first one represents the functional configuration of a “resting” human brain, and it is associated to a sedative (sevoflurane), the overall effect of the pathology and the level of arousal. The second FC-trait reflects the disconnection of the visual and sensory-motor connectivity patterns. It also relates to the time since the insult and to the ability of communicating with the external environment. The third FC-trait isolates the connectivity pattern encompassing the fronto-parietal and the default-mode network areas as well as the interaction between left and right hemispheres, which are also associated to the awareness of the self and its surroundings. Each FC-trait represents a distinct functional process with a role in the degradation of conscious states of functional brain networks, shedding further light on the functional sub-circuits that get disrupted in severe brain-damage.}

abstract = {In recent years, neuroimaging studies have increasingly been acquiring multiple modalities of data and searching for task- or disease-related changes in each modality separately. A major challenge in analysis is to find systematic approaches for fusing these differing data types together to automatically find patterns of related changes across multiple modalities, when they exist. Independent Component Analysis (ICA) is a popular unsupervised learning method that can be used to find the modes of variation in neuroimaging data across a group of subjects. When multimodal data is acquired for the subjects, ICA is typically performed separately on each modality, leading to incompatible decompositions across modalities. Using a modular Bayesian framework, we develop a novel “Linked ICA” model for simultaneously modelling and discovering common features across multiple modalities, which can potentially have completely different units, signal- and contrast-to-noise ratios, voxel counts, spatial smoothnesses and intensity distributions. Furthermore, this general model can be configured to allow tensor ICA or spatially-concatenated ICA decompositions, or a combination of both at the same time. Linked ICA automatically determines the optimal weighting of each modality, and also can detect single-modality structured components when present. This is a fully probabilistic approach, implemented using Variational Bayes. We evaluate the method on simulated multimodal data sets, as well as on a real data set of Alzheimer's patients and age-matched controls that combines two very different types of structural MRI data: morphological data (grey matter density) and diffusion data (fractional anisotropy, mean diffusivity, and tensor mode).}

abstract = {A key challenge in analyzing high-dimensional data is to extract meaningful low-dimensional structures, which typically represent signals of interest. Standard and widely used methods include principal components analysis (PCA), independent component analysis (ICA), and projection pursuit. Limitations of PCA in high-dimensional settings have been widely studied. In this work, we show that with a limited amount of high-dimensional data, the results of projection pursuit and related ICA methods should be interpreted with great care. Specifically, even with structureless data, one may find projections with highly non-Gaussian components that have no statistical or scientific significance. In contrast, restricting to sparse projections, detecting non-Gaussian components is still possible. Projection pursuit is a classical exploratory data analysis method to detect interesting low-dimensional structures in multivariate data. Originally, projection pursuit was applied mostly to data of moderately low dimension. Motivated by contemporary applications, we here study its properties in high-dimensional settings. Specifically, we analyze the asymptotic properties of projection pursuit on structureless multivariate Gaussian data with an identity covariance, as both dimension p and sample size n tend to infinity, with p/n→γ∈[0,∞]. Our main results are that (i) if γ=∞, then there exist projections whose corresponding empirical cumulative distribution function can approximate any arbitrary distribution; and (ii) if γ∈(0,∞), not all limiting distributions are possible. However, depending on the value of γ, various non-Gaussian distributions may still be approximated. In contrast, if we restrict to sparse projections, involving only a few of the p variables, then asymptotically all empirical cumulative distribution functions are Gaussian. And (iii) if γ=0, then asymptotically all projections are Gaussian. Some of these results extend to mean-centered sub-Gaussian data and to projections into k dimensions. Hence, in the “small n, large p” setting, unless sparsity is enforced, and regardless of the chosen projection index, projection pursuit may detect an apparent structure that has no statistical significance. Furthermore, our work reveals fundamental limitations on the ability to detect non-Gaussian signals in high-dimensional data, in particular through independent component analysis and related non-Gaussian component analysis.}}
