\maketitle

\abstract{%
The Kolmogorov--Smirnov (KS) test is a nonparametric statistical test used to test for differences between univariate probability distributions. The versatility of the KS test has made it a cornerstone of statistical analysis across many scientific disciplines. However, the test proposed by Kolmogorov and Smirnov does not easily extend to multivariate distributions. Here we present the \href{https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=fasano.franceschini.test}{fasano.franceschini.test} package, an R implementation of a multivariate two-sample KS test described by Fasano and Franceschini (1987). The fasano.franceschini.test package provides a test that is computationally efficient, applicable to data of any dimension and type (continuous, discrete, or mixed), and that performs competitively with similar R packages.
