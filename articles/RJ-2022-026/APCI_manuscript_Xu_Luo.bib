Cohort effects are particularly relevant for women with those born in the late 1960s and early 1970s more likely to participate over the life-cycle. Our results suggest that cohort effects can be interpreted as evolving social norms or preferences towards participating in the labour market according to Fernandez (NBER working paper no. 13373, 2007 ). We find substantial variation in the estimated age and cohort effects across European countries: cohort effects can account for a substantial part of the recent increase in participation in Spain, the Netherlands and Germany, and a positive, but smaller part of in the increase in participation of the UK, Italy and France. Looking forward, positive cohort effects could help counteract the downward impact of population ageing on participation. Copyright Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2014},

This process generically generates the data's S-shaped LFP curve and introduces a novel role for wage changes via their effect on the speed of intergenerational learning. The calibrated model does a good job of replicating the evolution of female LFP in the United States over the last 120 years and finds that the new role for wages was quantitatively significant.},

A key challenge is that trends for men and women are in opposite directions and appear to cancel each other out. We clarify this situation by examining trends in employer tenure by sex, marital status, and parental status. We find that married mothers are behind the increase in women's job tenure, but men and never-married women have seen declines in tenure. Furthermore, we show that the timing of tenure trends for women parallels periods of increased labor force attachment. Finally, we find that shifts in industry and occupation composition can account for the decline in tenure among men and never-married women before 1996 but not afterward. We situate these diverging trends in two broad shifts in expectations, norms, and behaviors in the labor market: the end-of-work discourse and the revolution in women's identification with paid work. Our findings support the view that job tenure is declining for all groups, but women's greater labor force attachment, especially their more continuous employment around childbirth, countered and masked this trend.},

Although there is considerable speculation that future developments in women's labor force participation may foster greater inequality, the empirical results are mixed. To assess the impact of women's labor force participation on the distribution of well-being, future research will need to consider the implications of taxes, job-related expenses, fringe benefits, and the value of homemaker services. Future research would also benefit from linking empirical research to an implicit sociological theory of family income-getting--one that recognizes the motivational structure of household decision-making as well as the changing environment that families face. Rising housing costs, poorer economic prospects of young men, and women's higher wage rates, for example, make wives' paychecks more salient, but family dependence on married women's earnings means secondary earners become a less viable way of coping with unemployment.}

Using data from the 1977-2006 General Social Surveys (GSS), this paper studies the impact of changing gender role attitudes on the evolution of FLP. The analysis uses a double prong instrumental variable strategy in the context of a variant of two-sample two-stage least squares (TS2LS). First, it appeals to extraneous attitudes found in the GSS, and second to an exogenous shock to attitudes, namely the AIDS scare, which may have acted as a counter-current to the ``Pill Revolution'', using repeated cross-sectional data from the 1988-2006 National Health Interview Surveys (NHIS). Gender role attitudes, whose progression stalled in the mid-1990s when the AIDS crisis peaked, are found to explain at least a third of the recent leveling-off in FLP that is, as much as all the usual variables combined.

This trend is related to both the increase in older men leaving the labor force and the worsening economic position of younger men since the mid-1960s.

We use the APC-Detrended (APCD) model to robustly estimate intensity of cohort effects identifying non-linear trends (or `detrended' fluctuations) in suicide rates. The new APC-Hysteresis (APCH) model tests temporal stability of cohort effects. Analysing suicide rates in 25 WHO countries (periods 1970\textendash 74 to 2005\textendash 09; ages 20\textendash 24 to 70\textendash 79) with the APCD method, we find that country-specific birth cohort membership plays an important role in suicide rates. Among 25 countries, we detect 12 nations that show deep contrasts among cohort-specific suicide rates including Italy, Australia and the United States. The APCH method shows that cohort fluctuations are not stable across the life course but decline in Spain, France and Australia, whereas they remain stable in Italy, the United Kingdom and the Netherlands. We discuss the Spanish case with elevated suicide mortality of cohorts born 1965\textendash 1975 which declines with age, and the opposite case of the United States, where the identified cohort effects of those born around 1960 increase smoothly, but statistically significant across the life course.},

This occurs because APCMC models are based on the main effects for each age group, each period, and each cohort, and these main effects only assess the additive effects of ages, periods, and cohorts. The main effects of ages are constant across periods and cohorts, the main effects of periods are constant across ages and cohorts, and the main effects of cohorts are constant across ages and periods. I present a method for assessing the stability of age effects within ages, period effects within periods, and cohort effects within cohorts. For example, does the cohort effect for a specific cohort diminish as the cohort ages or is it enhanced; is the period effect for a particular period stronger for younger aged people than for older aged people or does only a single age-group in a particular period deviate from the trend within that period. The proposed measures of the stability of these effects are based on estimable functions from the full APCMC model. Such functions are the same no matter which just identifying constraint is applied to the APCMC model. I illustrate the use of this approach using homicide arrest data for the United States from 1965 to 2015.},

Masters and associates estimated age, period, and cohort (APC) effects on U.S. mortality rates between 1959 and 2009 using the intrinsic estimator (IE). We first argue that before applying the IE, a grounded theoretical justification is needed for its fundamental constraint on minimum variance of the estimates. We next demonstrate IE’s high sensitivity to the type of dummy parameterization used to obtain the estimates. Finally, we discuss challenges in the interpretation of APC models. Our comments are not restricted to the article in question but pertain generally to any research that uses the IE.},

Despite the existence of hundreds, if not thousands, of articles and dozens of books, there is little agreement on how to adequately analyze APC data. This article begins with a brief overview of APC analysis, discussing how one can interpret APC effects in a causal way. Next, we review methods that obtain point identification of APC effects, such as the equality constraints model, Moore-Penrose estimators, and multilevel models. We then outline techniques that entail point identification using measured causes, such as the proxy variables approach and mechanism-based models. Next, we discuss a general framework for APC analysis grounded in partial identification using bounds and sensitivity analyses. We conclude by outlining a general step-by-step procedure for conducting APC analyses, presenting an empirical example examining temporal shifts in verbal ability.},

Socioeconomic status (SES) has smaller protective effects on the health of African Americans, and the differential association between social mobility and stress may explain the diminished returns of SES for African Americans. Aim. This study tested the race/ethnic differences in the association between upward and downward social mobility and stress in a nationally representative sample of African American and White American adults. Methods. This study included 3570 African Americans and 891 non-Hispanic White Americans from the National Survey of American Life (NSAL), 2003. Race/ethnicity, gender, age, upward and downward social mobility (independent variable, defined as difference between parent and respondent education), and stressful life events (SLE, dependent variable) were measured. Linear regression models were used for data analysis. Results. In the pooled sample that included both races, upward and downward social mobility were both associated with SLE, the net of all covariates. Significant interactions were found between race/ethnicity and social mobility, suggesting a stronger association between social mobility and stress for White Americans than for African Americans. According to race-stratified models, upward and downward social mobility were associated with higher SLE for White Americans but not African Americans. Conclusion. Although upwardly and downwardly mobile White Americans experience more stress than the socially stable White Americans, African Americans do not experience a change in SLE related to their intergenerational social mobility.},

  abstract = {While the social-structural construction of cultural taste has been a sustained subject of inquiry within the sociology of culture, its temporal dynamics have not received the same treatment. Using repeated cross-sectional survey data (1982-2012) and a novel age-period-cohort estimation strategy that treats cohort effects as age-by-period interaction effects, we detail how (a) age-graded trajectories, (b) historic fluctuations, and (c) generational acculturation jointly determine the temporal dynamics of cultural omnivorousness among Americans. First, we find that omnivorousness accumulates over the life-course in age-graded trajectories. Individuals experience their peak levels of omnivorousness in the mid-to-late stages of adulthood. Taste acquisition is most rapid in the early phases of adulthood, and slows down towards the late phases of adulthood. Second, omnivorousness is subject to unpredictable historic fluctuations. Sharp increases in the 1990s recess and stabilize in the two decades to follow. Third, generational acculturation affects omnivorousness in uneven ways. Baby boomers experience higher than expected levels of omnivorousness, while the cohorts preceding and succeeding the Baby Boomers instead experience lower than expected levels of omnivorousness. Generational acculturation may also manifest most strongly in the early and late stages of adulthood. Our results imply that any temporal analysis of culture cannot avoid dealing with the age, period and cohort identification problem, that the period affect associated with the 1992 wave of the SPPA persists even in an age-period-cohort analysis, and that generational differences are endogenous to any time-invariant index of cultural taste.},

However, a focus on trends in overdose deaths may obscure important sociological dynamics. The authors provide heatmap visualizations of estimated annual rates of past-year substance use, rather than overdose deaths, for prescription pain relievers and heroin. These visualizations are based on weighted analyses of self-reports, cross-classified by age and period, collected as part of the National Survey on Drug Use and Health from 2002 to 2017. Whereas descriptions of the U.S. opioid crisis tend to focus on period dynamics, these visualizations indicate that cohort patterns of drug use are also evident in addition to well-known age variation. A substantive focus on cohort patterns highlights the possibility that cohorts of people who use drugs may remain at risk for overdose in the years to come. These findings suggest that policies aimed only at restricting opioid availability may have limited effects.},

  abstract = {Random effects (RE) models have been widely used to study the contextual effects of structures such as neighborhoods or schools. The RE approach has recently been applied to age-period-cohort (APC) models that are unidentified because the predictors are exactly linearly dependent. However, research has not fully explained how the RE specification identifies these otherwise unidentified APC models. We address this challenge by first making explicit that RE-APC models have greater—not less—rank deficiency than the traditional fixed-effects model, followed by two empirical examples. We then provide intuition and a mathematical proof to explain that for APC models with one RE, treating one effect as an RE is equivalent to constraining the estimates of that effect’s linear component and the random intercept to be zero. For APC models with two REs, the effective constraints implied by the model depend on the true (i.e., in the data-generating mechanism) nonlinear components of the effects that are modeled as REs, so that the estimated linear components of the REs are determined by the true nonlinear components of those effects. In conclusion, RE-APC models impose arbitrary although highly obscure constraints and thus do not differ qualitatively from other constrained APC estimators.},

Yet the potential of many social processes to account for individual aging patterns remains untapped, because research and theory have focused heavily upon comparisons between cohorts rather than the internal differentiation of cohorts. This paper shows that focusing upon intracohort differentiation over the life course leads to a mobilization of sociological findings whose age-related implications have not been exploited. Using the phenomenon of "aged heterogeneity" as an illustrative case, it is suggested that intracohort differentiation--operating through macro-level, organizational, and micro-level processes--can explain significant phenomena of aging previously neglected by theory, or else assumed to be psychological in origin. These processes specify Merton's "Matthew effect." Implications for biological aging and for research are briefly discussed.},

  abstract = {We develop a mixed (fixed and random effects) models approach to the age-period-cohort (APC) analysis of micro data sets in the form of a series of the repeated cross-section sample surveys that are increasingly available to sociologists. This approach recognizes the multilevel structure of the individual-level responses. As a substantive illustration, we apply our proposed methodology to data on verbal test scores from 15 cross-sections of the General Social Survey, 1974–2000. These data have been the subject of recent debates in the sociological literature. We show how our approach can be used to shed new light on these debates by identifying and estimating age, period, and cohort components of change.},

These may pose a threat to stability but they also provide the opportunity for societal transformation. Each birth cohort acquires coherence and continuity from the distinctive development of its constituents and from its own persistent macroanalyic feaures. Successive cohorts are differentiated by the changing content of formal education, by peer-group socialization, and by idiosyncratic historical experience. Young adults are prominent in war, revolution, immigration, urbanization and technological change. Since cohorts are used to achieve structural transformation and since they manifest its consequences in characteristic ways, it is proposed that research be designed to capitalize on the congruence of social change and cohort identification.},

Unless two of these three variables are viewed as indexing identical unmeasured causal factors, any analysis which makes estimates for only two of the three variables is subject to spurious results. But three-way cohort analysis is problematic because age, time period and birth cohort are linearly dependent on each other. Although this confounding makes estimation of some three-way cohort models impossible, this paper demonstrates that estimation is feasible in a number of such models. By exploring estimates derived for some of these models from hypothetical data for which the underlying effects are known, this paper also shows that meaningful three-way cohort analysis is difficult unless the researcher entertains relatively strong hypotheses about the nature of aging, period and cohort effects.},

The identifiability problem inherent to this model is discussed, and its adverse effects on the results of APC modeling exercises are illustrated numerically. Potential problems attendant with the use of two-factor models are described, and other possible modeling approaches currently in use are discussed. Interpretational limitations due to certain innate characteristics of typical APC data sets are also detailed. Given all the documented potential sources for error, the current state-of-the-art regarding the statistical modeling of APC data should be considered to be at an early stage of development.},

  abstract = {This paper discusses the specific problems of age-period-cohort (A-P-C) analysis within the general framework of interaction assessment for two-way cross-classified data with one observation per cell. The A-P-C multiple classification model containing the effects of age groups (rows), periods of observation (columns), and birth cohorts (diagonals of the two-way table) is characterized as one of a special class of models involving interaction terms assumed to have very specific forms. The so-called A-P-C identification problem, which results from the use of a particular interaction structure for detecting cohort effects, is shown to manifest itself in the form of an exact linear dependency among the columns of the design matrix. The precise relationship holding among these columns is derived, as is an explicit formula for the bias in the parameter estimates resulting from an incorrect specification of an assumed restriction on the parameters required to solve the normal equations. Current methods for modeling A-P-C data are critically reviewed, an illustrative numerical example is presented, and one potentially promising analysis strategy is discussed. However, gien the large number of possible sources for error in A-P-C analyses, it is strongly recommended that the results of such analyses be interpreted with a great deal of caution.},

  abstract = {One of the core primary care reform initiatives seen across provinces in Canada is the introduction of inter-professional primary healthcare teams in which family physicians are encouraged to collaborate with other health professionals. Although a higher proportion of physicians are collaborating with various health professionals now compared to the previous decade, a substantial number of physicians still do not work in a collaborative setting. The objective of this paper is to examine the age, period and cohort effects of Canadian family physicians’ decisions to collaborate with seven types of health professionals: specialists, nurse practitioners, nurses, dieticians, physiotherapists, psychologists and occupational therapists. To this end, this paper employs a multivariate probit model consisting of seven equations and a cross-classified fixed-effects strategy to explain the collaborative decisions of family physicians. Utilizing three cross-sectional physician surveys from Canada over the 2001–2007 period, cohorts are defined over five-year intervals according to their year of graduation from medical school. We find that newer cohorts of physicians are more likely to collaborate with dieticians, physiotherapists, psychologists and occupational therapists; newer female cohorts are more likely to collaborate with nurses while newer male cohorts are less likely to collaborate with nurses but more likely to collaborate with specialists. Older physicians are more likely to collaborate with specialists, physiotherapists, psychologists, and occupational therapists; the age effect for nurses is U-shaped for male physicians while it is inverse U-shaped for females. Family physicians are collaborating more with all seven health professionals in 2004 and 2007 compared to 2001. Belonging to a group practice has a largely positive influence on collaborations; and being paid by a fee-for-service remuneration scheme exerts a negative influence on collaboration, ceteris paribus. The findings suggest that combining a non-fee-for-service remuneration arrangement with a group practice structure would facilitate effective collaboration.},
