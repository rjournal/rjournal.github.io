Textual data is encoded using a low rank nonnegative matrix factorization algorithm to retain natural data nonnegativity, thereby eliminating the need to use subtractive basis vector and encoding calculations present in other techniques such as principal component analysis for semantic feature abstraction. Existing techniques for nonnegative matrix factorization are reviewed and a new hybrid technique for nonnegative matrix factorization is proposed. Performance evaluations of the proposed method are conducted on a few benchmark text collections used in standard topic detection studies.},

The resulting matrices are constrained to have only non-negative coefficients. NMF can be used to reduce the number of characteristics in a dataset, while preserving the relevant information that allows for the reconstruction of the original data. Since negative coefficients are not allowed, the original data is reconstructed through additive combinations of the parts-based factorized matrix representation. A Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) implementation of the NMF algorithms, using both the multiplicative and the additive (gradient descent) update rules is presented for the Euclidean distance as well as for the divergence cost function. The performance results on an image database demonstrate extremely high speedups, making the GPU implementations excel by far the CPU implementations.},
