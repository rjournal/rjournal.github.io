\maketitle

\abstract{%
The R-package GeoAdjust adjusts for positional uncertainty in GPS
coordinates and performs fast empirical Bayesian geostatistical
inference for household survey data from the Demographic and Health
Surveys (DHS) Program. DHS household survey data is important for
tracking demographic and health indicators, but is published with
intentional positional error to preserve the privacy of the household
respondents. Such jittering has recently been shown to deteriorate
geostatistical inference and prediction, and GeoAdjust is the first
software package that corrects for jittering in geostatistical models
containing both spatial random effects and raster- and distance-based
covariates. The package provides inference for model parameters and
predictions at unobserved locations, and supports Gaussian, binomial
and Poisson likelihoods with identity link, logit link, and log link
functions, respectively. GeoAdjust provides functions that make model
and prior specification intuitive and flexible for the user, as well
as routines for plotting and output analysis.
