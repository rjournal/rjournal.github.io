abstract = {Summary There are several non-functional-form-based interaction tests for testing additivity in unreplicated two-way layouts. The distinctness of the various tests in this setting is somewhat unfortunate, as no single test can detect all patterns of possible interaction, and the tests are sensitive to a particular pattern of interaction. Therefore, it is reasonable to combine multiple interaction tests for testing additivity. The main problem is how we can combine multiple dependent tests into a single test such that it has an acceptable performance in terms of controlling the type I error rate and maximizing the power. In this paper, we review six methods for combining interaction tests which utilize six different non-functional-form-based interaction tests. We also propose two novel combination methods based on the Jacobi polynomial expansion and the Gaussian copula. We first compare these eight combination methods in terms of controlling the type I error rate via a simulation study. We then compare the six interaction tests and four combination methods in terms of power. The simulation results show that our proposed combination method that is based on the Jacobi polynomial expansion has the best performance in terms of controlling the type I error rate and maximizing the power. Therefore, we recommend this combination method as a test procedure for testing additivity. The major contribution of this work is to provide researchers with a testing approach which leverages many existing methods to detect disparate forms of non-additivity. This alleviates the need for researchers to naively choose among highly specialized methods by instead allowing for a general approach that captures a number of interaction effects with reasonable power.},

    abstract = { Abstract In two-way classification analysis of variance situations there often exists a systematic type of row column interaction. A model is proposed in which the interaction is of the type Q i γ i where Q i is a parameter of the ith row, not necessarily associated with the main effect for rows, and γ j is the main effect for column j. The analysis of data according to this model is given, including estimation and tests of significance. The model is more general than that involved in Tukey's “one degree of freedom for non-additivity” and includes the latter as a special case. The relationship between the two methods is discussed. Applications of the method to different types of problems are mentioned and a numerical example is included. }

 abstract = { When there are several replicates available at each level combination of two factors, testing nonadditivity can be done by the usual two-way ANOVA method. However, the ANOVA method cannot be used when the experiment is unreplicated (one observation per cell of the two-way classification). Several tests have been developed to address nonadditivity in unreplicated experiments starting with Tukey's (1949) one-degree-of-freedom test for nonadditivity. Most of them assume that the interaction term has a multiplicative form. But such tests have low power if the assumed functional form is inappropriate. This leads to tests which do not assume a specific form for the interaction term. This paper proposes a new method for testing interaction which does not assume a specific form of interaction. The proposed test has the advantage over the earlier tests that it can also be used for incomplete two-way tables. A simulation study is performed to evaluate the power of the proposed test and compare it with other well-known tests. }

abstract = { Testing for any significant interaction between two variables depends on the number of replicates in each cell of the two-way table and structure of the interaction. If there is interaction between two factors model of observations include interaction term and is called 'non-additive model' which makes interaction and non-additivity equivalent in terms of meaning.
When there are several observations taken at each level combination of two variables, testing non-additivity can easily be done by usual two-way ANOVA method which cannot be used when there is only one observation per cell.
For the cases with only one observation per cell, some methods have been developed starting with Tukey’s one-degree-of-freedom test in which interaction is supposed to be the product of two factor’s effects.
 There are other methods which are used for different structures of interaction when there is only one observation.
 In this paper, we review some of these tests. After presenting general methodology for the two-factor linear model with interaction effect and the general two-way ANOVA method when there are n > 1 observations per cell, we present some methods for testing non-additivity when there is only one observation per cell.
 Finally, we illustrate these methods on examples. }
