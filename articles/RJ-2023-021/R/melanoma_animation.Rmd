# The Australian Cancer Atlas


```{r fig.cap = "This animation changes from a choropleth map to a hexagon tile map of Australian Statistical Areas at Level 2 using Standardised Incidence Ratios from the Australian Cancer Atlas website."}
knitr::include_graphics("melanoma_animation.gif")
```

The animation draws attention to the dramatic change between the size of the rural areas and the size of the hexagons used to represent them. It then draws viewer's attention to the densely populated capital cities, and the amount of areas represented by the amount of hexagons.


```{r fig.cap = "A choropleth map of the distribution of Standardised Incidence Rates of melanoma cancer for Australians."}
knitr::include_graphics("kobakian_sugarbag_jss/figures/aus_melanoma_p.png")
```

The choropleth map shows majority of the Australian landmass as light blue. This means the SIR for melanoma cancer in the rural areas is below the Australian average. Brisbane and the surrounding areas appear above average, with inner city areas with much higher than average rates indicated by the colour red.

```{r fig.cap = "A hexagon tile map distribution of Standardised Incidence Rates of melanoma cancer for Australians."}
knitr::include_graphics("kobakian_sugarbag_jss/figures/aus_melanoma_p_hex.png")
```

The hexagon tile map focuses on presenting the values related to the population dense cities. There are more dark and light blue areas in Melbourne, as well as the inner city and south western suburbs of Sydney. The inner city suburbs of Brisbane are close to the Australian average, and surrounding areas are coloured orange and red to show areas with higher rates.
However, this display is unfamiliar to many users. 



The code below is used to create these maps. To animate requires joining the hexagon tile map data to the geographic shapes used to create the choropleth map.

```
library(tidyverse)
library(sugarbag)
library(sf)

SIR <- read_csv("data/SIR Downloadable Data.csv")
aus_sa2 <- absmapsdata::sa22011 %>% filter(sa2_name_2011 %in% SIR$SA2_name)

```
