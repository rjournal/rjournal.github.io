# Introduction

Power is an important feature of statistical tests that refers to the
probability of correctly identifying the occurrence of an event given
the event is actually present. Specifically, in the frequentist setting,
the power of a test describes the probability that the test will
correctly reject the null hypothesis, $H_0$, given that the alternative
hypothesis, $H_1$, is true. Conversely, $\beta = 1 - \text{power}$
represents the probability that a test will fail to identify a true
effect. For any given test, power is a function of the underlying effect
size, the significance level, $\alpha$, and the sample size, $n$ . While
the underlying effect size is rarely under the experimenter's control,
the significance level and the sample size are. Hence, it is important
to conduct power analysis to determine appropriate assignments of
$\alpha$ and $n$ for an experiment to have a good chance of detecting an
effect if one exists. Power curves serve as a useful tool in quantifying
the degree of assurance held towards meeting a study's analysis
objective across a range of sample sizes. Formulating sample size
determination as a decision problem so that power is an increasing
function of sample size, offers the investigator a visual aid in helping
deduce the minimum sample size needed to achieve a desired power.

The analogue of power in the Bayesian setting is *assurance*, which is
based upon the probability of meeting a desired analysis objective. As
an example, our analysis objective could be to ascertain if the
difference between two population quantities, $\theta_1$ and $\theta_2$,
exceeds a certain threshold $\theta_0$, i.e.,
$\theta_1 - \theta_2 > \theta_0$. We decide that our analysis objective
is met if the posterior probability of the above event given data we
have observed exceeds $\omega$, i.e.,
$P(\theta_1 - \theta_2 > \theta_0 \mid y) > \omega$ with $y$ being the
realized data. Assurance is defined as the probability of the analysis
objective being met under an assumed distribution of the data, i.e.,
$\delta = P_{y}\left\{y: P\left(\theta > \theta_0 \mid {y}\right) > \omega \right\}$,
where ${y}$ denotes the observed data. Several publications adopt a
similar approach, where they determine sample size based upon some
criteria of analysis or model performance [@rahme; @wang; @ohagan].
Other proposed solutions of the sample size problem introduce frameworks
that prioritize conditions specific to the problem at hand, e.g. the use
of Bayesian average errors to simultaneously control for Type I and Type
II errors [@reyes], the use of posterior credible interval lengths to
evaluate sample size estimates [@joseph], and the use of survival
regression models to target Bayesian meta-experimental designs [@reyes].

  : Overview of the functions available for use within the package.
:::

There are several [R]{.sans-serif} packages for Bayesian sample size
determination using specified analytic criteria. The SampleSizeMeans
package contains a series of functions used for determining appropriate
sample sizes based on various Bayesian criteria for estimating means or
differences between means of normal variables [@samplesizemeans].
Criteria considered include the Average Length Criterion, the Average
Coverage Criterion, and the Modified Worst Outcome Criterion
[@joseph1995; @joseph1997]. A supplementary package,
SampleSizeProportions, addresses study designs for estimation of
binomial proportions using the same set of criteria [@samplesizeprop].
Our package, bayesassurance calculates Bayesian assurance and sample
sizes for analysis objectives using normal and binomial models. We
devise a two stage framework using possibly different sets of prior
distributions in the design and analysis stages. The prior in the design
stage represents a model that generates the data. The prior in the
analysis stage represents the analyst's beliefs about the data. These
two prior distributions are possibly different because the analyst does
not usually have enough prior information on the processes generating
the data. We primarily demonstrate sample size determination using
conjugate Bayesian linear regression models as a prototype for this
article, although the [R]{.sans-serif} package offers functions for
calculating Bayesian assurance for binary or binomial models as well. In
the current article, we focus on the flexibility of Bayesian linear
regression models and demonstrate determination of unequal sample sizes
for two samples and longitudinal study designs.

The bayesassurance package is available on CRAN [@bayesassurance] and
contains a collection of functions that can be divided into three
categories based on design and usage. These include closed-form
solutions, simulation-based solutions, and visualization and/or design
purposes. All available functions are presented in
Table [1](#tab:overview){reference-type="ref" reference="tab:overview"}.
Fully worked-out examples and tutorials can be found on our Github page
at <https://github.com/jpan928/bayesassurance_rpackage>. This article
describes the basic underlying framework leading to analytically
tractable expressions for Bayesian assurance. We will also illustrate
the relationship between Bayesian and frequentist sample size
determination. In addition, we briefly explore simulation-based
assurance methods, outlining the statistical distribution theory
associated with each method, followed by examples worked out in
[R]{.sans-serif} that users will be able to replicate. Finally, we offer
some useful graphical features and design matrix generators offered by
the package. In the following sections, we provide a detailed overview
for each of the available functions grouped by category followed with
worked out examples in [R]{.sans-serif}.

# Closed-form Solution of Assurance {#sec:closedformassurance}

Bayesian assurance evaluates the tenability of attaining a specified
outcome through the implementation of prior and posterior distributions.
The `assurance_nd_na` function computes the exact assurance using a
closed-form solution. Classical frequentist (Neyman-Pearson) inference
proceeds as follows. Prior to an experiment, the analyst determines the
sample size, as well as significance level ($\alpha$), which defines the
maximum frequency of false positives (type I errors) they are willing to
tolerate, if the null hypothesis is true. Then, once the data has been
collected, a statistical test is conducted which yields the p-value or
the probability of seeing the observed data under the null hypothesis.
If the p-value is lower than $\alpha$, the null hypothesis is rejected.
In contrast, in Bayesian inference refrains from "rejecting" or "failing
to reject the null hypothesis". Instead, we look at the tenability of a
hypothesis based upon realized data. As an example, suppose we seek to
evaluate the tenability of $H : \theta > \theta_0$ given data from a
Gaussian population with mean $\theta_0$ and known variance $\sigma^2$.
We assign two sets of priors for $\theta$, one at the
$\textit{design stage}$ and the other at the $\textit{analysis stage}$.
These two stages are the primary components that make up the skeleton of
our generalized solution in the Bayesian setting and will be revisited
in later sections. The analysis objective specifies the condition that
needs to be satisfied. It defines a positive outcome, which serves as an
overarching criteria that characterizes the study. Our analysis
objective is to ascertain if
$P(\theta > \theta_0 \mid \bar{y}) > 1-\alpha$, where $\bar{y}$ is the
data average and $\alpha$ is a specified threshold. Assuming the prior
$\theta \sim N\left(\mu, \frac{\sigma^2}{n_a}\right)$, the posterior
distribution of $\theta$ is $$\label{eq: simple_posterior}
N\left(\theta {\, \left | \, \mu, \frac{\sigma^2}{n_a} \right.}\right) \times N\left(\bar{y} {\, \left |\, \theta, \frac{\sigma^2}{n} \right.}\right)
\propto N\left(\theta {\, \left |\, \frac{n_a}{n + n_a}\mu + \frac{n}{n + n_a}\bar{y}, \frac{\sigma^2}{n + n_a}\right.}\right)\;,$$
where $n$ denotes the sample size of the data, $\bar{y}$ denotes the
mean of the data, and $n_a$ is specified by the data analyst to quantify
the prior degree of belief on $\theta$.

The design objective is to find the sample size needed to ensure that
the analysis objective is met $100\delta\%$ of the time, where $\delta$
denotes the assurance. At the design stage, we specify a model for the
underlying population from which the data is generated. Our belief about
this population is quantified using a *design prior* [we borrow this
terminology from @ohagan], say
$\theta \sim N\left(\mu, \frac{\sigma^2}{n_d}\right)$, where $n_d$ is
specified by the user to quantify the degree of belief (or amount of
confidence) on the population parameters. Bayesian assurance is given by
$$\label{eq:assurance_general}
\delta = P_{\bar{y}}\left\{\bar{y}: P(\theta > \theta_0 \mid \bar{y}) > 1 - \alpha\right\}\;,$$
where $P_{\bar{y}}(\cdot)$ denotes the marginal distribution of
$\bar{y}$ obtained from the design priors
$$\int{N\left(\theta {\,\left|\,\mu, \frac{\sigma^2}{n_d}\right.}\right) \times N\left(\bar{y} {\,\left |\, \theta, \frac{\sigma^2}{n} \right.}\right) d\theta} 
= N\left(\bar{y} {\,\left |\,\mu, \left(\frac{1}{n} + \frac{1}{n_d}\right) \sigma^2 \right.}\right)\;.$$
Applying this to
([\[eq:assurance_general\]](#eq:assurance_general){reference-type="ref"
reference="eq:assurance_general"}) we obtain $$\label{eq:assurance}
\delta(\Delta, n) = \Phi\left(\sqrt{\frac{nn_d}{n+n_d}}
\left[\frac{n+n_a}{n}\frac{\Delta}{\sigma} + Z_{\alpha}\frac{n+n_a}{n}\right]\right)\;,$$
where $\Phi(\cdot)$ is the standard normal CDF with $Z_{\alpha}$ being
its $\alpha$-th quantile and $\Delta = \mu - \theta_0$.

We remark that the above expression assumes that $\sigma^2$ is known.
This is a customary assumption made about the population in sample size
calculations and is usually based upon pilot studies or historic data.
Nevertheless, in theory we can relax this assumption and assign a prior
distribution to $\sigma^2$. Conjugate priors include the inverse-Gamma
family of distributions and analogous formulas to
([\[eq:assurance\]](#eq:assurance){reference-type="ref"
reference="eq:assurance"}) may be derived in terms of distribution
functions of the (non-central) t-distribution. Nevertheless, we do not
pursue this development here but discuss the case of unknown $\sigma^2$
later in the linear regression setting. We now describe the function to
compute ([\[eq:assurance\]](#eq:assurance){reference-type="ref"
reference="eq:assurance"}).
Table [2](#tab:assurance_nd_na){reference-type="ref"
reference="tab:assurance_nd_na"} lists the set of parameters used in
`assurance_nd_na`, with alpha taking a default value of 0.05.

graphical display of the assurance curve, shown in
Figure [1](#fig:assur_plot){reference-type="ref"
reference="fig:assur_plot"}. The first six rows of the table are
reported in the outputs.

We make a few remarks pertaining to the functions in bayesassurance.
First, we are passing a single value of sample size or a vector of
sample sizes for n. We save the results as a variable out. n can be
either a scalar or vector. If n is a scalar, this tells the function
that we only want to determine the assurance for one particular sample
size. When this is the case, out will return a single assurance value
with no plot. Alternatively, if a vector of sample sizes is passed in as
n, as is the case of the example above, assurance is computed for a list
of sample sizes, and the function will produce both a table and an
assurance curve showing the results. As long as n is of length two or
greater, assurance_nd_na will plot the assurance curve with red points
denoting user-specified assurance values and black points denoting all
other points outside those specified points.
Figure [1](#fig:assur_plot){reference-type="ref"
reference="fig:assur_plot"} presents the assurance curve resulting from
the example. The graph is created using ggplot2 [@ggplot2] which is
imported into bayesassurance. Simply typing out\$assurance_table and
out\$assurance_plot will display the table and plot respectively in this
particular set of examples.

## Special case: convergence with the frequentist setting

Depending on how we define the parameters in `assurance_nd_na`, we can
demonstrate a relationship between the Bayesian and classical power
analysis. In particular, the classical, or frequentist, power function
is a special case of Bayesian solution when letting
$n_d \rightarrow \infty$ and $n_a = 0$ in
[\[eq:assurance\]](#eq:assurance){reference-type="eqref"
reference="eq:assurance"}. Therefore, assigning a weak analysis prior
and a strong design prior yields $$\label{eq:assurance_weakprior}
\Phi\Big(\sqrt{n}\frac{\Delta}{\sigma} + Z_\alpha\Big),$$ which is
equivalent to the frequentist power expression that takes the form
$$\nonumber
1-\beta = P\Big(\bar{y} > \theta_0 +
 \frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}Z_{1-\alpha}\Big) = 
\Phi\Big(\sqrt{n}\frac{\Delta}{\sigma} + Z_\alpha\Big).$$ The following
code chunk demonstrates this special case in [R]{.sans-serif} using the
`assurance_nd_na` function:

The bayesassurance package includes a `pwr_freq` function that
determines the statistical power of testing the difference between two
means given a set of fixed parameter values that yield a closed-form
solution of power and sample size. Continuing with the one-sided case,
the solution is $$\label{eq:power_func}
1-\beta = P\left(\bar{y} > \theta_0 +
 \frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}Z_{1-\alpha}\right) = 
\Phi\left(\sqrt{n}\frac{\Delta}{\sigma} + Z_\alpha\right),$$ where
$\Delta = \theta_1 - \theta_0$ is the critical difference and $\Phi$
denotes the cumulative distribution function of the standard normal.
Note this formula is equivalent to the special case of the assurance
definition expressed in

under these conditions, Bayesian assurance converges to frequentist
power. Figure [2](#fig:pwr_assur_curve){reference-type="ref"

# Simulation-based functions using conjugate linear models {#sec:simform}

Henceforth, we focus on computing assurance through simulation-based
means and highlight the common scenario of performing sample size
analysis where closed-form solutions are unavailable. In the following
sections, we extend upon the two-stage design structure and discuss how
the design and analysis objectives are constructed based on the sample
size criteria.

We seek to evaluate the tenability of a well-defined analysis objective
using our simulation-based functions. The functions take an iterative
approach alternating between generating a dataset in the design stage
and evaluating whether or not the dataset satisfies the analysis
objective. The assurance equates to the proportion of datasets that meet
the objective.

We start in the analysis stage. Consider a set of $n$ observations
denoted by $y = (y_1, y_2, \cdots, y_n)^{\top}$ that are to be collected
together with $p$ controlled explanatory variables,
$x_1, x_2, \cdots, x_p$. Specifically, $$y = X_n\beta + \epsilon_n,$$
where $X_n$ is an $n \times p$ design matrix whose $i$th row
$x_i^{\top}$, and $\epsilon_n \sim N(0, \sigma^2V_n)$, where $V_n$ is a
known $n \times n$ correlation matrix. We assume $X_n$ has linearly
independent columns. A conjugate Bayesian linear regression model
specifies the joint distribution of the parameters $\{\beta, \sigma^2\}$
and $y$ as
$$IG(\sigma^2|a_{\sigma}, b_{\sigma}) \times N(\beta|\mu_{\beta}^{(a)},
\sigma^2V_{\beta}^{(a)}) \times N(y | X_n\beta, \sigma^2V_n),$$ where
superscripts $(a)$ indicate parameters in the analysis stage. The
objective is to find the assurance of the realized data favoring
$H: u^{\top}\beta > C$, where $u$ is a $p \times 1$ vector of fixed
contrasts and $C$ is a known constant. Inference proceeds from the
posterior distribution given by $$\label{eq:post_dist}
p(\beta, \sigma^2|y) = IG(\sigma^2|a_{\sigma}^*, b_{\sigma}^*)
\times N(\beta|M_nm_n, \sigma^2M_n),$$ where $$\begin{aligned}
    & M_n^{-1} = V_{\beta}^{-1(a)} + X_n^{\top}V_n^{-1}X_n; \quad m_n = V_{\beta}^{-1(a)}\mu_{\beta}^{(a)} + X_n^{\top}V_n^{-1}y \\
    & a^*_{\sigma} = a_{\sigma}+\frac{n}{2}; \quad 
    b^*_{\sigma} = b_{\sigma} +
    \frac{1}{2}\left\{\mu_{\beta}^{\top}V_{\beta}^{-1}\mu_{\beta} +
    y_n^{\top}V_n^{-1}y - m_n^{\top}M_nm_n\right\}.
\end{aligned}$$ The posterior distribution helps shape our analysis
objective.

If $\sigma^2$ is known and fixed, then the posterior distribution of
$\beta$ is $\displaystyle p(\beta | \sigma^2, y) = N(\beta | 
M_nm_n, \sigma^2M_n)$ shown in the
Equation [\[eq:post_dist\]](#eq:post_dist){reference-type="eqref"
reference="eq:post_dist"}. We use the posterior components of $\beta$ to
evaluate $H: u^{\top}\beta > C$, where standardization leads to
$$\label{eq1}                                                                    
\left.\frac{u^{\top}\beta - u^{\top}M_nm_n}{\sigma \sqrt{u^{\top}M_nu}} \right| \sigma^2, y \sim N(0,1)\;.$$
Hence, to assess the tenability of $H: u^{\top}\beta > C$, we decide in
favor of $H$ if the observed data belongs in the set $$\begin{aligned}
    A_{\alpha}(u, \beta, C) &= \left\{y: P\left(u^{\top}\beta
    \leq C | y\right)  < \alpha\right\} = \left\{y: \Phi
    \left(\frac{C - u^{\top}M_n m_n}{\sigma \sqrt{u^{\top}M_nu}}\right)
    < \alpha \right\}.
\end{aligned}$$ This defines our analysis objective, which we will
monitor within each sample iteration. Sample generation is taken to
account for in the design stage discussed in the next section.

In the design stage, the goal is to seek a sample size $n$ such that the
analysis objective is met at least $100\delta \%$ of the time, where
$\delta$ is the assurance. This step requires determining the marginal
distribution of $y$, which is assigned a separate set of priors to
quantify our belief about the population from which the sample will be
taken. Hence, the marginal of $y$ under the design priors will be
derived from $$\begin{aligned}
\label{eq: ohagan_stevens_linear_regression_design_priors}
  y &=  X_n\beta + \epsilon_n; \quad \epsilon_n \sim N(0, \sigma^2 V_n)\;;\quad \beta = \mu_{\beta}^{(d)} + \omega; \quad \omega \sim N(0, \sigma^2 V_{\beta}^{(d)})\;,
\end{aligned}$$ where
$\beta\sim N(\mu_{\beta}^{(d)},\sigma^2 V_{\beta}^{(d)})$ is the design
prior on $\beta$ and $(d)$ denotes parameters in the design stage.
Substituting the equation for $\beta$ into the equation for $y$ gives
$y = X\mu_{\beta}^{(d)} + (X\omega + \epsilon_n)$ and, hence,
$$y \sim N\left(X\mu_{\beta}^{(d)}, \sigma^2V_n^{*}\right) \quad \mbox{ and }\quad 
V_n^{\ast} = \left(XV_{\beta}^{(d)}X^{\top} + V_n\right).$$

To summarize our simulation strategy for estimating the Bayesian
assurance, we fix sample size $n$ and generate a sequence of $J$
datasets $y^{(1)}, y^{(2)}, ..., y^{(J)}$. A Monte Carlo estimate of the
Bayesian assurance is computed as
$$\hat{\delta}(n) = \frac{1}{J}\sum_{j=1}^J \mathbb{I}\left(\left\{y^{(j)}:
    \Phi \left(\frac{C - u^{\top}M_n^{(j)}m_n^{(j)}}{\sigma
    \sqrt{u^{\top}M_n^{(j)}u}}\right) < \alpha \right\}\right)\;,$$
where $\mathbb{I}(\cdot)$ is the indicator function of the event in its
argument, $M_n^{(j)}$ and $m_n^{(j)}$ are the values of $M_n$ and $m_n$
computed from $y^{(j)}$.

## Assurance computation with known variance {#sec:assur_knownvar}

The simulation-based function, `bayes_sim`, determines the assurance
within the context of conjugate Bayesian linear regression models
assuming known variance, $\sigma^2$. The execution of `bayes_sim` is
straightforward. An important feature is that users are not required to
provide their own design matrix, $X_n$, when executing `bayes_sim`. When
Xn = NULL, the function automatically constructs an appropriate design
matrix based on the specified sample size(s), using the built-in
`gen_Xn` function.

Later sections discuss design matrix generators in greater detail.
Setting Xn = NULL facilitates calculation of assurances across a vector
of sample sizes, where the function sequentially updates the design
matrix for each unique sample size undergoing evaluation.
Table [4](#tab:bayes_sim){reference-type="ref"
reference="tab:bayes_sim"} lists the required set of parameters.

### Example 1: scalar parameter

This example computes the tenability of $H: u^{\top}\beta > C$ in the
case when $\beta$ is a scalar. In the following code block, we assign a

Each unique value passed into n corresponds to a separate balanced study
design containing that particular sample size for each of the $p$ groups
undergoing assessment. In this example, setting p = 1, u = 1 and C =
0.15 implies that we are evaluating the tenability of $H: \beta > 0.15$,
where $\beta$ is a scalar. Furthermore, Vbeta_d and Vbeta_a_inv are
scalars to align with the dimension of $\beta$. A weak analysis prior (
Vbeta_a_inv = 0) and a strong design prior ( Vbeta_d = 0) produces the
classical power analysis. We revisit this example in a later section
when reviewing features that allow users to simultaneously visualize the
Bayesian and frequentist power analyses. Finally, Xn and Vn are set to
NULL, which means they will take on the default settings described
above.

### Example 2: linear contrasts {#subsec:ex2}

In this example, we assume $\beta$ is a vector of unknown components
rather than a scalar. We use the real-world example discussed
in [@ohagan]. Specifically, we consider a randomized clinical trial that
compares the cost-effectiveness of two treatments. Cost-effectiveness is
evaluated using a net monetary benefit measure expressed as
$$\xi = K(\mu_2 - \mu_1) - (\gamma_2 - \gamma_1),$$ where $\mu_1$ and
$\mu_2$ denote the efficacy of treatments 1 and 2, and $\gamma_1$ and
$\gamma_2$ denote the costs, respectively. Hence, $\mu_2 - \mu_1$ and
$\gamma_2 - \gamma_1$ correspond to the true differences in treatment
efficacy and costs. The threshold unit cost, $K$, represents the maximum
price that a health care provider is willing to pay for a unit increase
in efficacy.

In this setting,we seek the tenability of $H: \xi > 0$, which, if true,
indicates that treatment 2 is more cost-effective than treatment 1. To
comply with the conjugate linear model framework outlined in
[\[eq:post_dist\]](#eq:post_dist){reference-type="eqref"
reference="eq:post_dist"}, we set $u = (-K, 1, K, -1)^{\top}$,
$\beta = (\mu_1, \gamma_1, \mu_2, \gamma_2)^{\top}$, and $C = 0$, giving
us an equivalent form of $\xi > 0$ expressed as $u^{\top}\beta > 0$. All
other inputs of this application were directly pulled from [@ohagan].
The following code sets up the inputs to be passed into `bayes_sim`.

The inputs specified above should result in an assurance of
approximately 0.70 according to  [@ohagan]. The `bayes_sim` returns a

## Assurance computation in the longitudinal setting {#sec:assur_longitudinal}

We demonstrate an additional feature embedded in the function tailored
to longitudinal data. In this setting, $n$ no longer refers to the
number of subjects but rather the number of repeated measures reported
for each subject, assuming a balanced study design. Referring back to
the linear regression model discussed in the general framework, we can
construct a longitudinal model that utilizes this same linear regression
form, where $y_n = X_n\beta + \epsilon_n$.

Consider a group of subjects in a balanced longitudinal study with the
same number of repeated measures at equally-spaced time points. In the
base case, where time is treated as a linear term, subjects can be
characterized as
$$%y_{ij} = \beta_{0i} + \beta_{1i}t_{ij} + \epsilon_{ij}, 
y_{ij} = \alpha_{i} + \beta_{i}t_{ij} + \epsilon_{i},$$ where $y_{ij}$
denotes the $j^{th}$ observation on subject $i$ at time $t_{ij}$,
$\alpha_{i}$ and $\beta_{i}$ denote the intercept and slope terms for
subject $i$, respectively, and $\epsilon_i \sim N(0, \sigma^2_i)$ is an
error term.

In a simple case with two subjects, we can individually express the
observations as $$\begin{aligned}
y_{11} &= \alpha_{1} + \beta_{1}t_{11} + \epsilon_{1}\\
&\vdots\\
y_{1n} &= \alpha_{1} + \beta_{1}t_{1n} + \epsilon_{1}\\
y_{21} &= \alpha_{2} + \beta_{2}t_{21} + \epsilon_{2}\\
&\vdots\\
y_{2n} &= \alpha_{2} + \beta_{2}t_{2n} + \epsilon_{2},
\end{aligned}$$ assuming that each subject contains $n$ observations.
The model can also be expressed using matrices: $$\begin{gathered}
\label{eq:long_model}
 \underbrace{\begin{pmatrix} y_{11} \\ \vdots \\ y_{1n} \\ y_{21} \\ \vdots\\ y_{2n} \end{pmatrix}}_{y_n} =
   \underbrace{
   \begin{pmatrix}
   1 & 0 & t_{11} & 0\\
   \vdots & \vdots & \vdots & \vdots \\
   1 & 0 & t_{1n} & 0\\
   0 & 1 & 0 & t_{21}\\
   \vdots & \vdots & \vdots & \vdots \\
   0 & 1 & 0 & t_{2n}
   \end{pmatrix}
   }_{X_n}
   \underbrace{
      \begin{pmatrix}
         \alpha_{1}\\
         \alpha_{2}\\
         \beta_{1}\\
         \beta_{2}
      \end{pmatrix}
   }_{\beta}
   + 
   \underbrace{
   \begin{pmatrix}
   \epsilon_{1}\\
   \vdots\\
   \epsilon_{1}\\
   \epsilon_{2}\\
   \vdots\\
   \epsilon_{2}
   \end{pmatrix}
   }_{\epsilon_n}
\end{gathered}$$ bringing us back to the linear model structure. If
higher degrees are to be considered for the time variable, such as the
inclusion of a quadratic term, the model would be altered to include
additional covariate terms that can accommodate these changes. In the
two-subject case, incorporating a quadratic term for the time variable
in [\[eq:long_model\]](#eq:long_model){reference-type="eqref"
reference="eq:long_model"} will result in the model being modified as
follows: $$\begin{gathered}
\nonumber
 \underbrace{\begin{pmatrix} y_{11} \\ \vdots \\ y_{1n} \\ y_{21} \\ \vdots\\ y_{2n} \end{pmatrix}}_{y_n} =
   \underbrace{
   \begin{pmatrix}
   1 & 0 & t_{11} & 0 & t_{11}^2 & 0\\
   \vdots & \vdots & \vdots & \vdots & \vdots & \vdots\\
   1 & 0 & t_{1n} & 0 & t_{1n}^2  & 0\\
   0 & 1 & 0 & t_{21} & 0 & t_{21}^2 \\
   \vdots & \vdots & \vdots & \vdots & \vdots & \vdots \\
   0 & 1 & 0 & t_{2n} & 0 & t_{2n}^2
   \end{pmatrix}
   }_{X_n}
   \underbrace{
      \begin{pmatrix}
         \alpha_{1}\\
         \alpha_{2}\\
         \beta_{1}\\
         \beta_{2}\\
         \phi_{1}\\
         \phi_{2}
      \end{pmatrix}
   }_{\beta}
   + 
   \underbrace{
   \begin{pmatrix}
   \epsilon_{1}\\
   \vdots\\
   \epsilon_{1}\\
   \epsilon_{2}\\
   \vdots\\
   \epsilon_{2}
   \end{pmatrix}
   }_{\epsilon_n}
\end{gathered}$$ In general, for $m$ subjects who each have $n$ repeated
measures, a one-unit increase in the degree of the time-based covariate
will result in $m$ additional columns being added to the design matrix
$X_n$ and $m$ additional rows added to the $\beta$ vector.

When working in the longitudinal setting, additional parameters need to
be specified in the `bayes_sim` function, which can be found in

  : Additional parameter specifications needed to run `bayes_sim` in the

:::

By default, longitudinal = FALSE and ids, from, and to are set to NULL
when working within the standard conjugate linear model. When
longitudinal = TRUE, n takes on a different meaning as its value(s)
correspond to the number of repeated measures for each subject rather
than the total number of subjects in each group. When longitudinal =
TRUE and Xn = NULL, `bayes_sim` implicitly relies on a design matrix
generator, `gen_Xn_longitudinal`, that is specific to the longitudinal
setting to construct appropriate design matrices.

### Example 3: longitudinal setting

The following example uses similar parameter settings as the
cost-effectiveness example we had previously discussed in Example 2, now
with longitudinal specifications. We assume two subjects and want to
test whether the growth rate of subject 1 is different from that of
subject 2. Figure [3](#fig:ex3){reference-type="ref"
reference="fig:ex3"} displays the estimated assurance points given the
specifications.

Assigning an appropriate linear contrast lets us evaluate the tenability
of an outcome. Let us consider the tenability of $u^{\top}\beta \neq C$
in this next example that uses simulated data, where
$u = (1, -1, 1, -1)^{\top}$ and $C = 0$. There are 120 arbitrary
timepoints. The number of repeated measurements per subject to be tested
includes values 10 through 100 in increments of 5. This indicates that
we are evaluating the assurance for 19 study designs in total. $n = 10$
divides the specified time interval into 10 evenly-spaced timepoints
between 0 and 120.

![[]{#fig:ex3 label="fig:ex3"} Estimated assurance points for
longitudinal example.](ex3_assurplot.pdf){#fig:ex3 width="8 cm"}

For a more complicated study design comprised of more than two subjects
that are divided into two treatment groups, consider testing if the mean
growth rate is higher in the first treatment group than that of the
second, e.g. if we have three subjects per treatment group, the linear
contrast would be set as
$u = (0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1/3, 1/3, 1/3, -1/3, -1/3, -1/3)^{\top}$.

## Assurance computation for unbalanced study designs {#sec:assur_unbalanced}

The `bayes_sim_unbalanced` function operates similarly to `bayes_sim`
but estimates the assurance of attaining $u^{\top}\beta > C$
specifically in unbalanced design settings. Users provide two sets of
sample sizes of equal length, whose corresponding pairs are considered
for each study design case. The `bayes_sim_unbalanced` function provides
a higher degree of flexibility for designing unbalanced studies and
offers a more advanced visualization feature. Users have the option of
viewing assurance as a 3-D contour plot and assess how the assurance
behaves across varying combinations of the two sets of sample sizes that
run along the $x$ and $y$ axes.

The `bayes_sim_unbalanced` function is similar to `bayes_sim` in terms
of parameter specifications with a few exceptions. Parameters unique to
`bayes_sim_unbalanced` are summarized in
Table [6](#tab:unbalanced){reference-type="ref"
reference="tab:unbalanced"}. Here, Xn = NULL, Vn = NULL, repeats = 1 and
surface_plot = TRUE by default.

As in bayes_sim, it is recommended that users set Xn = NULL to
facilitate the automatic construction of appropriate design matrices
that best aligns with the conjugate linear model. Recall that every
unique sample size (or sample size pair) passed in corresponds to a
separate study that requires a separate design matrix. Should users
choose to provide their own design matrix, it is advised that they
evaluate the assurance for one study design at a time, in which a single
design matrix is passed into Xn along with scalar values assigned for
the sample size parameter(s).

Saved outputs from executing the function include

1.   assurance_table: table of sample size and corresponding assurance
    values

2.   contourplot: contour map of assurance values if surface.plot = TRUE

3.   mc_samples: number of Monte Carlo samples that were generated for
    evaluation

### Example 4: unbalanced assurance computation with surface plot

The following code provides a basic example of how
`bayes_sim_unbalanced` is executed. It is important to check that the
parameters passed in are appropriate in dimensions, e.g. mu_beta_a and
mu_beta_d should each contain the same length as that of u, and the
length of u should be equal to the row and column dimensions of Vbeta_d
and Vbeta_a_inv.

A table of assurance values is printed simply by calling
assur_out\$assurance_table, which contains the exact assurance values
corresponding to each sample size pair. The contour plot, shown in
Figure [4](#fig:ex5){reference-type="ref" reference="fig:ex5"}, is
displayed using assur_out\$contourplot, and offers a visual depiction of
how the assurance varies across unique combinations of n1 and n2. Areas
with lighter shades denote higher assurance levels. The next example
implements the function in a real-world setting that offers more
sensible results.

### Example 5: cost-effectiveness application

We revisit the cost-effectiveness problem discussed in Example 2. In
addition to providing a 3-D graphical display of the assurance, this
example also demonstrates how the repeats parameter is applied.

Recall from Example 2 that two distinct sets of efficacy and cost
measures are used to compare the cost-effectiveness of treatments 1 and
2. The efficacy and costs are denoted by $\mu_i$ and $\gamma_i$ for
$i = 1, 2$ treatments. Hence, the parameter we want to estimate contains
four elements tied to the unknown efficacy and costs of treatments 1 and
2, i.e. $\beta = (\mu_1, \gamma_1, \mu_2, \gamma_2)^{\top}$. It was
previously assumed that the treatments contain an equal number of
observations, suggesting that the sample sizes across each of the four
explanatory variables are also equal. Using `bayes_sim_unbalanced`
offers the added flexibility of constructing an unbalanced study design
between treatments 1 and 2. Since the two treatments each contain two
components to be measured, we use the repeats parameter to indicate that
we want two sets of sample sizes, c(n1, n2), passed in, i.e. c(n1, n2,
n1, n2). It then becomes clear that our study design consists of $n_1$
observations for the efficacy and cost of treatment 1, and $n_2$
observations for those of treatment 2.
Figure [5](#fig:ex6){reference-type="ref" reference="fig:ex6"} displays
a contour plot with a noticeable increasing trend of assurance values
across larger sets of sample sizes.

# Bayesian assurance using other conditions {#sec:othermethods}

The bayesassurance [R]{.sans-serif} package contains several other
assurance functions characterized by analysis stage objectives that are
dependent on fixed precision levels [@cj] and posterior credible
intervals [@pham]. These functions are denoted respectively as
`bayes_adcock` and `bayes_sim_betabin`. The package also includes a
`bayes_goal_func` function framed under a utility-based setting [see,
e.g., @raiffa; @berger; @lindley; @parm; @parmigiani; @inoue] that
determines sample size in relation to the rate of correct classification
[@inoue]. Since the simulation-based assurance functions all follow a
similar format, for the sake of brevity, we will not include detailed
descriptions of them in this article. Vignettes outlining detailed
descriptions and walkthrough tutorials can be found on our Github page
(<https://github.com/jpan928/bayesassurance_rpackage>), which contains
examples that users can easily follow along and reproduce on their own
machines.

# Visualization Features and Useful Tools {#sec:tools}

## Overlapping power and assurance curves

To facilitate an understanding of the relationship held between Bayesian
and frequentist power analysis, the `pwr_curves` function produces a
single plot displaying both power and assurance points. Recall that the
primary difference held between `pwr_freq` and `assurance_nd_na` is the
need to specify additional precision parameters, $n_a$ and $n_d$, in
`assurance_nd_na`. Knowing that power and sample size analysis in the
frequentist setting is essentially a special case of the Bayesian
assurance with precision parameters tailored to weak analysis priors and
strong design priors, the `pwr_curves` function serves as a
visualization tool in seeing how varying precision levels affect
assurance values and how these assurance values compare to those we
would expect under classical/frequentist power analysis (strong design
priors, weak analysis priors).

The `pwr_curves` function takes the combined set of parameters presented
in `pwr_freq` and `assurance_nd_na`, which includes n, n_a, n_d,
theta_0, theta_1, sigsq, and alpha. For further customization, users
have the option to include a third set of points in their plot along
with the power and assurance curves. These additional points would
correspond to the simulated assurance results obtained using
`bayes_sim`. Optional parameters to implement this include

1.   bayes_sim: logical that indicates whether the user wishes to
    include simulated assurance results obtained from `bayes_sim`.
    Default setting is FALSE.

2.   mc_iter: specifies the number of MC samples to evaluate given
    bayes_sim = TRUE.

The following code segment runs the `pwr_curves` function using a weak
analysis stage prior ( n_a is set to be small) and a strong design stage
prior ( n_d is set to be large). Implementing this produces a plot where
the assurance points lay perfectly on top of the power curve as shown in
Figure [6](#fig:pwr_curve_ex1){reference-type="ref"
reference="fig:pwr_curve_ex1"}. The simulated assurance points obtained
from `bayes_sim` are also plotted as we set bayes_sim = TRUE. These
points are highlighted in blue, which lie very close in proximity to
those of the exact assurance points highlighted in red. We can also view
individual tables of the three sets of points by directly calling them
from the saved outputs, e.g. out\$power_table shows the individual
frequentist power values for each sample size. The output we provide
shows the first ten rows.

The next code segment considers the scenario in which both analysis and
design stage priors are weak ( n_a and n_d are set to be small). This
special case shows how the assurance behaves when vague priors are
assigned. Substituting 0 in for both $n_a$ and $n_d$ in
Equation [\[eq:assurance\]](#eq:assurance){reference-type="eqref"
reference="eq:assurance"} results in a constant assurance of
$\Phi(0) = 0.5$ regardless of the sample size and critical difference.
Figure [7](#fig:pwr_curve_ex2){reference-type="ref"
reference="fig:pwr_curve_ex2"} illustrates these results, where we have
the regular power curve and the flat set of assurance points at 0.5 for
both exact and simulated cases.

## Design matrix generators {#design_matrix_generators}

In the last few sections, we go over design matrix generators that are
used inside functions within the bayesassurance package when the Xn
parameter is set to NULL. We include these functions in case users wish
to see how design matrices are constructed under this particular
setting.

### Standard design matrix generator {#subsubsec:standard_designmatrix}

The standard design matrix generator, `gen_Xn`, is relevant to a
majority of the simulation-based assurance functions discussed
throughout the paper. It should be noted that all simulation-based
functions available in this package do not require users to specify
their own design matrix $X_n$. Users have the option of leaving Xn =
NULL, which prompts the function to construct a default design matrix
using `gen_Xn` that complies with the general linear model
$y_n = X_n\beta +
\epsilon$, $\epsilon \sim N(0, \sigma^2V_n)$. The function runs in the
background while `bayes_sim` is used.

When called directly, the `gen_Xn` function takes in a single parameter,
n, which can either be a scalar or vector. The length of n corresponds
to the number of groups being assessed in the study design as well as
the column dimension of the design matrix, denoted as p. Therefore, in
general, the resulting design matrix is of dimension $n \times p$. If a
scalar value is specified for n, the resulting design matrix carries a
dimension of $n \times 1$.

In the following example, we pass in a vector of length $p = 4$, which
outputs a design matrix of column dimension 4. Each column is comprised
of ones vectors with lengths that align with the sample sizes passed in
for n. The row dimension is therefore the sum of all the entries in n.
In this case, since the values 1, 3, 5, and 8 are being passed in to n,
the design matrix to be constructed carries a row dimension of
$1 + 3 + 5 + 8 = 17$ and a column dimension of 4.

:::

The `bayes_sim` function and its related family of functions generate
design matrices using `gen_Xn` in the following way. Each unique value
contained in n that is passed into `bayes_sim` corresponds to a distinct
study design and thus requires a distinct design matrix. The `gen_Xn`
function interprets each $i^{th}$ component of n as a separate balanced
study design comprised of $n_i$ participants within each of the $p$
groups, where p is a parameter specified in `bayes_sim`. For example, if
we let Xn = NULL and pass in n \<- 2, p \<- 4 for `bayes_sim`, `gen_Xn`
will process the vector n \<- c(2, 2, 2, 2) in the background. Hence,
we'd obtain an $8 \times 4$ matrix of the form $$X_n = 
\begin{bmatrix}
1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 0 & 1 \\
0 & 0 & 0 & 1 \\
\end{bmatrix}.$$

### Design matrix generator in longitudinal setting {#subsubsec:long_designmatrix}

Example 3 demonstrates how the linear model is extended to incorporate
time-based covariates within the context of a longitudinal setting. For
this special case, a separate function is used to generate design
matrices that are appropriate for this setting. The `genXn_longitudinal`
constructs its design matrices differently than `gen_Xn` and therefore
requires a different set of parameter specifications. When the
longitudinal parameter is set to TRUE in `bayes_sim`, the user is
required to specify the following set of parameters, which are directly
passed into `genXn_longitudinal`:

1.   ids: vector of unique subject ids, usually of length 2 for study
    design purposes

2.   from: start time of repeated measures for each subject

3.   to: end time of repeated measures for each subject

4.   num_repeated_measures: desired length of the repeated measures
    sequence. Should be a non-negative number, will be rounded up if
    fractional.

5.   poly_degree: degree of polynomial in longitudinal model, set to 1
    by default.

Referring back to the model that was constructed for the case involving
two subjects, we observe in
Equation [\[eq:long_model\]](#eq:long_model){reference-type="eqref"
reference="eq:long_model"} that the design matrix contains vectors of
ones within the first half of its column dimension and lists the
timepoints for each subject in the second half. Constructing this design
matrix requires several components. The user needs to specify subject
IDs that are capable of uniquely identifying each individual in the
study. Next, the user needs to specify the start and end time as well as
the number of repeated measures reported for each subject. The number of
repeated measures denotes the number of evenly-spaced timepoints that
take place in between the start and end time. Since we are assuming a
balanced longitudinal study design, each subject considers the same set
of timepoints. Finally, if the user wishes to consider time covariates
of higher degrees, such as a quadratic or cubic function, this can be
altered using the poly_degree parameter, which takes on a default
assignment of 1.

In the following code, we pass in a vector of subject IDs and specify
the start and end timepoints along with the desired length of the
sequence. The resulting design matrix contains vectors of ones with
lengths that correspond to the number of repeated measures for each
unique subject.

# Discussion

This article introduced bayesassurance, a new [R]{.sans-serif} package
for computing Bayesian assurance under various conditions using a
two-stage framework. The goal of this package is to provide a convenient
and user-friendly interface to statisticians and data scientists who
seek sample size calculations using the assurance function in Bayesian
data analysis. We have attempted to provide an organized,
well-documented open-source code that can be used to address a wide
range of study design problems, such as in the case of clinical trials,
and demonstrate the feasibility of applying Bayesian methods to such
problems.
