Dear Mark van der Loo,
\bigskip

Thank you for considering our article titled "Kernel Heaping - Kernel Density Estimation from Regional Aggregates via Measurement Error Model" for publication in the R Journal.

The manuscript summarizes finding from the so-called `Kernelheaping` packages, which provides smoothing methods for aggregated data and its graphical representation.

We believe the readers of the R Journal will find this article helpful for their work because it provides generally useful instructions that will work for many purposes.
