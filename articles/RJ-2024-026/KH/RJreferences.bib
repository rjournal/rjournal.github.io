 abstract = {We consider quasi-likelihood estimation with estimated parameters in the variance function when some of the predictors are measured with error. We review and extend four approaches to estimation in this problem, all of them based on small measurement error approximations. A taxonomy of the data sets likely to be available in measurement error studies is developed. An asymptotic theory based on this taxonomy is obtained and includes measurement error and Berkson error models as special cases.},

abstract = {Abstract.  The performance of multivariate kernel density estimates depends crucially on the choice of bandwidth matrix, but progress towards developing good bandwidth matrix selectors has been relatively slow. In particular, previous studies of cross-validation (CV) methods have been restricted to biased and unbiased CV selection of diagonal bandwidth matrices. However, for certain types of target density the use of full (i.e. unconstrained) bandwidth matrices offers the potential for significantly improved density estimation. In this paper, we generalize earlier work from diagonal to full bandwidth matrices, and develop a smooth cross-validation (SCV) methodology for multivariate data. We consider optimization of the SCV technique with respect to a pilot bandwidth matrix. All the CV methods are studied using asymptotic analysis, simulation experiments and real data analysis. The results suggest that SCV for full bandwidth matrices is the most reliable of the CV methods. We also observe that experience from the univariate setting can sometimes be a misleading guide for understanding bandwidth selection in the multivariate case.},

 abstract = {Cross-validation with Kullback-Leibler loss function has been applied to the choice of a smoothing parameter in the kernel method of density estimation. A framework for this problem is constructed and used to derive an alternative method of cross-validation, based on integrated squared error, recently also proposed by Rudemo (1982). Hall (1983) has established the consistency and asymptotic optimality of the new method. For small and moderate sized samples, the performances of the two methods of cross-validation are compared on simulated data and specific examples.},
