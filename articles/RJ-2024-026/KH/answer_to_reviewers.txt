Thank you for the kind word. 
The intention of the papers and the R package is correctly captured.

I agree, thank you.

The naive estimator uses a rather large bandwidth, so that the first set of 
pseudo-samples are drawn rather equally across the domain. 
I have added the calculation method in step 1.

In the part in which the Multivariate Kernel Density Estimation is explained, I have 
added a short description of the plug-in estimator.

Corrected it, thank you.

Corrected it, thank you.

Rewrote it, now it should be clearer.

Corrected it, thank you.

If a sample point has or has not the characteristic of interest is seen as binary. Hence, 
the sample $s_C^{(t)} are guaranteed to have the characterisic of interest. Note additionally that
pseudo samples are drawn, and not locations of the real population. 


> Case Study:

Corrected it to dataset, thank you. 
 
> - I don't see any instructions on the installation of the package.

In the paragraph in which all packages needed to perform the code, I have written 
how to install and load these packages.

> "... total number of inhabitants ...".

Corrected it, thank you.

This input will be taken into account in the next package update.

I have added an additionally sentence in page 10 to adress this issue. 

> - The code that creates Figure 3 is missing. 

This code was intentionally left out of the paper because the focus should 
be on the functions of the kernelheaping package. 


> - There is a gap in the code leading to Figure 4. Particularly, between getting the

I have seen that there is a line of code missing calculating the proportions of 
Turkish migrants and append it to the berlin shape file. 
Therefore, I have added the missing line such that the code works properly.

I have corrected all typos/textual errors noticed and during reading 
through the article, corrected some others.

There is no function "Kernelheaping" in the package and should truely be removed from p. 12. 
Examples to the functions need to be added to the documentary. The toOtherShape function can 
transfer the pseudo samples to other areal system. To meaningfully utilize this function, 
the other area system should have the same boundaries. As the pseudo samples from the 
sampling phase are aggregated to another area level, the mean count is returned. Additionally 
other statistical values such as the standard devaiation and the 90 % quartil are returned. 
This is not well-documented in the package description and will be added during the next update. 


> Code:

I have added comments to the code, such that the code becomes clearer.

> - Two coding styles are mixed, sometimes uses `<-` and sometimes uses `=` within the same function.

When assigning objects I used "<-". Here, an "=" would be possible as well, however as something 
is either newly defined or changed, this gives stronger indication. 
In functions it is only possible using "=". 


> - The command library(Kernelheaping) returns the following Warning message:

After deleting and reloading the package on 3 PC using Windows I do not get the warning. 
According to https://github.com/lozalojo/mem/issues/1 this seems like an OS problem.

Your comment will be taken into account in the next update.

The summary is accurate.

I have added a paragraph with other kernel method under measurement error, including 
deconvolutional kernels where the error density is known. Additionally I have added some applications. 

> - Methodology: Add a subsection detailing the selection and adjustment of bandwidth parameters. 
>  Provide practical guidelines or heuristics for choosing these parameters.

In the theoretical explanation of the multivariate kernel density estimator I have added a 
paragraph to explain the problem of bandwidth selection. I have also explained the 
idea of the plug-in method used in the "Kernelheaping" package. 
The problem of bandwidth selection is widely discussed in literature and therefore, I have cited 
a paper which systematically explain different automatic bandwidth selection methods. 
Additionally I have evaluated other bandwidth selectors to compare with the plug-in bandwidth.

> - Please include a section showing an overview of functions in the package before the case studies section.

A section with the main functions of the package and their explanation and classification has been included in the 
paper. Thank you for that comment. 

> - Computational Performance: Include a section on computational performance, detailing the runtime and 
>   efficiency of the SEM algorithm. Compare with other KDE methods to provide context for the reader.

I have inculded a simulation study with different data settings and geographic areas. Based on them and 
different grid sizes the computational performence of the algorithm is provided. A comparison to other KDE 
methods is not possible, as to the authors knowlegde, the proposed algorithm is the only algorithm dealing 
with SEM in the context of Kernel Density Estimation or Kernel Density in combination with aggregated data. 

> - Case Studies: The applications presented are relevant, but the robustness of the method could be 
>   better demonstrated by including more diverse case studies. This would help to validate the method 
>   across different types of aggregated data and geographic regions.

I have included a simulation study passed on different data structures generated from a mixture of 
normal distributions with various covariance matrices and geographic regions. As the practical examples
took place in the Berlin, different regional levels of Berlin were tested in the simulation study. 
The geographic regions depend in sizes but reflect administrative boundaries. Thank you for the input.

> - Limitations: The paper should include a discussion on the limitations of the proposed method. 
>   For instance, under what conditions might the SEM algorithm fail to provide accurate results? 
>   Are there specific types of data or aggregation patterns for which this method is less effective?

In the simulation study I have inculded an error measure, the normed RMISE, where it can be seen that 
for more agglomerated data, and less aggregation areas the algorithm perform worse. 
Thank you for the input, including a simulation study to evaluate the behavior of the algorithm is 
useful for other applications.

The documentation will be updated /impoved during the next update of the package. 
The assignment of the operator follow the rule that, when assigning objects I used "<-". 
In functions it is only possible to use "=".

Corrected that. Thank you.
