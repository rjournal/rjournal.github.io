Dear Professor Hyndman,
\bigskip

Please consider our article titled "Exploring Image Analysis in R: Applications and Advancements" for publication in the R Journal.

This review provides an overview of R packages applicable to image analysis in biological research environments, with a particular emphasis on workflows relevant to the analysis of microbead particles. These materials are increasingly studied in ecological, biomedical, and environmental contexts, and we use them as a concrete showcase to illustrate the practical capabilities of various R packages.

The paper systematically covers both general-purpose image processing packages (e.g., EBImage, magick, imager) and more specialized toolkits tailored to specific bioimage informatics tasks. We discuss use cases, strengths and limitations of the packages, integration with other R tools, and potential for reproducible and scalable analysis. Our goal is to bridge the gap between biological questions and the technical implementation of image analysis pipelines in R.

To our knowledge, this is the first review to focus on the landscape of R-based image analysis tools from the perspective of everyday needs in biological laboratories. We believe this work will be valuable not only to biologists and environmental scientists adopting R for their image-based workflows but also to the broader R community interested in interdisciplinary applications of image analysis in R.

We believe that the R Journal is the ideal venue for our article due to its strong readership among R developers, users, and researchers across disciplines. We hope our contribution will encourage further development and adoption of R in the bioimage informatics field.

Thank you for considering our submission. We look forwards to the opportunity to contribute to the R Journal.
