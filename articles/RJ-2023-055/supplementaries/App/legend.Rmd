<h5><b>Variables summarized</b></h5>

* **REM**: Relative excess mortality.
* **NED**: Number of excess deaths.

'Inf' values may appear for some NUTS3 areas (or weeks in the temporal plots) for some combinations of age and sex when the expected number of deaths is zero. These values should be interpreted as that there is not enough information as to provide reliable estimates of the observed number of deaths.
