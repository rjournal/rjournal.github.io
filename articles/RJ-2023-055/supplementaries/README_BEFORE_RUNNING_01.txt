Some data files (in the 'data' folder) are too large as to be stored in GitHub. All data files can be dowloaded from the following link:

To be able to run the 01_RetrieveTemperature.R file:

1. Create an account here https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/cdsapp#!/home, 
2. Agree with the terms here: https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/cdsapp/#!/terms/licence-to-use-copernicus-products,
3. Log in and once you are ok and logged in, click on your name on the top right next to logout and retrieve the information 
about the API key and UID number. These will be used to download the data through R


Alternatively, the required temperature (and other) files are also available in
folder 'Output' in

https://imperialcollegelondon.app.box.com/s/5di16s2ybnpfcltnfcl5en2rom5fj5vd

and could be copied locally in the 'Output' folder.

Users running the code from scratch after 28.02.2023 are suggested NOT TO RUN the 01-02_1_RetrieveTemperature.R file.
