For the former case, available models are reviewed briefly, the role of preliminary testing is discussed and a procedure for fitting a parametric model is outlined. A simulation study of several tests of spatial randomness is intended to provide some insight into the suitability for model-fitting of various summary descriptions of a mapped pattern. Two examples illustrate the use of the statistical techniques. Some problem areas which merit further investigation are identified.},

  Abstract                 = {This article presents an algorithm that generates a conservative confidence interval of a specified length and coverage probability for the power of a Monte Carlo test (such as a bootstrap or permuta -any Monte Carlo test. Previous research has focused on obtaining as accurate a result as possible for a fixed computational effort, without providing a guaranteed precision in the above sense. The algorithm we propose does not have a fixed effort and runs until a confidence interval with a user-specified length and coverage probability can be constructed. We show that the expected effort required by the algorithm is finite in most cases of practical interest, including situations where the distribution of the p-value is absolutely continuous or discrete with finite support. The algorithm is implemented in the R-package simctest, available on CRAN.},

To test the complete spatial randomness hypothesis, Diggle (1979) proposed a Monte Carlo test whose test statistic is the discrepancy between the estimated and the theoretical form of some summary function, such as the Ripley K-function. In this article, we improve this test by adding various weight functions and get more powerful tests if decreasing and increasing weight functions are used for processes with short and long, respectively, range of interaction.},

This paper shows that when we use Ripley�s K-function as the summary function, it is possible to avoid using an arbitrary upper bound by using adapted distance dependent intensity estimators.},

From an ecological perspective, we are able both to confirm existing knowledge on species� interactions and to generate new biological questions and hypotheses on species� interactions.},

We apply the proposed model and methodology to the analysis of tornado report data from 1953 to 2010 in the United States. Our analysis shows that in addition to the spatial and seasonal effects, the topographic variability is an important component of tornado risk.},
