  Abstract =	 {A bias correction to the Akaike information
                  criterion, AIC, is derived for regression and
                  autoregressive time series models. The correction is
                  of particular use when the sample size is small, or
                  when the number of fitted parameters is a moderate
                  to large fraction of the sample size. The corrected
                  method, called AICC, is asymptotically efficient if
                  the true model is infinite dimensional. Furthermore,
                  when the true model is of finite dimension, AICC is
                  found to provide better model order choices than any
                  other asymptotically efficient method. Applications
                  to nonstationary autoregressive and mixed
                  autoregressive moving average time series models are
                  also discussed.},

  Abstract =	 {By extending Schwarz's (1978) basic idea we derive a
                  Bayesian information criterion which enables us to
                  evaluate models estimated by the maximum penalised
                  likelihood method or the method of
                  regularisation. The proposed criterion is applied to
                  the choice of smoothing parameters and the number of
                  basis functions in radial basis function network
                  models. Monte Carlo experiments were conducted to
                  examine the performance of the nonlinear modelling
                  strategy of estimating the weight parameters by
                  regularisation and then determining the adjusted
                  parameters by the Bayesian information
                  criterion. The simulation results show that our
                  modelling procedure performs well in various
                  situations.},

@article{LucianiEtAl09,
  Abstract =	 {The emergence of antibiotic resistance in
                  Mycobacterium tuberculosis has raised the concern
                  that pathogen strains that are virtually untreatable
                  may become widespread. The acquisition of resistance
                  to antibiotics results in a longer duration of
                  infection in a host, but this resistance may come at
                  a cost through a decreased transmission rate. This
                  raises the question of whether the overall fitness
                  of drug-resistant strains is higher than that of
                  sensitive strains---essential information for
                  predicting the spread of the disease. Here, we
                  directly estimate the transmission cost of drug
                  resistance, the rate at which resistance evolves,
                  and the relative fitness of resistant strains. These
                  estimates are made by using explicit models of the
                  transmission and evolution of sensitive and
                  resistant strains of M. tuberculosis, using
                  approximate Bayesian computation, and molecular
                  epidemiology data from Cuba, Estonia, and
                  Venezuela. We find that the transmission cost of
                  drug resistance relative to sensitivity can be as
                  low as 10{\%}, that resistance evolves at rates of
                  ≈0.0025--0.02 per case per year, and that the
                  overall fitness of resistant strains is comparable
                  with that of sensitive strains. Furthermore, the
                  contribution of transmission to the spread of drug
                  resistance is very high compared with acquired
                  resistance due to treatment failure (up to
                  99{\%}). Estimating such parameters directly from in
                  vivo data will be critical to understanding and
                  responding to antibiotic resistance. For instance,
                  projections using our estimates suggest that the
                  prevalence of tuberculosis may decline with
                  successful treatment, but the proportion of cases
                  associated with resistance is likely to increase.},
