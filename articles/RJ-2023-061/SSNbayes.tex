\abstract{
Spatio-temporal models are widely used in many research areas from ecology to epidemiology. However, a limited number of computational tools are available for modeling river network datasets in space and time. In this paper, we introduce the \texttt{R} package \CRANpkg{SSNbayes} for fitting Bayesian spatio-temporal models and making predictions on branching stream networks. \CRANpkg{SSNbayes} provides a linear regression framework with multiple options for incorporating spatial and temporal autocorrelation. Spatial dependence is captured using stream distance and flow connectivity while temporal autocorrelation is modelled using vector autoregression approaches. \CRANpkg{SSNbayes} provides the functionality to make predictions across the whole network, compute exceedance probabilities, and other probabilistic estimates, such as the proportion of suitable habitat. We illustrate the functionality of the package using a stream temperature dataset collected in the Clearwater River Basin, USA.

\section{Introduction}

Rivers and streams are of vital ecological and economic importance \citep{vorosmarty2010global} but are under pressure from anthropogenic impacts such as climate change, pollution, water extractions, and overfishing. In the past, data describing critical characteristics such as nutrients, sediments, pollutants and stream flow tended to be sparse in space and/or time. However, recent developments in in-situ sensor technology have revolutionized ecological research and natural resource monitoring. These new data sets create exciting opportunities to measure, learn about, and manage the spatio-temporal dynamics of abiotic (e.g. temperature, water chemistry, habitat characteristics) and biotic processes (e.g. migration, predation, and competition). However, the unique spatial relationships found in stream data (e.g. branching network structure, longitudinal (upstream/downstream) connectivity, water flow volume and direction) and high-frequency of sampling create analytical challenges that make it difficult to gain meaningful insights from these datasets. We attempt to overcome these challenges through the \CRANpkg{SSNbayes} package which provides convenient and practical tools to undertake Bayesian inference in complex spatial and temporal stream network settings.
