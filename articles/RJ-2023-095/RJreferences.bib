	abstract = {The analysis of censored failure times is considered. It is assumed that on each individual are available values of one or more explanatory variables. The hazard function (age-specific failure rate) is taken to be a function of the explanatory variables and unknown regression coefficients multiplied by an arbitrary and unknown function of time. A conditional likelihood is obtained, leading to inferences about the unknown regression coefficients. Some generalizations are outlined.},

title ={Benchmarking survival outcomes: A funnel plot for survival data},
journal = {Statistical Methods in Medical Research},
volume = {0},
number = {0},
year = {2022},
abstract = { Benchmarking is commonly used in many healthcare settings to monitor clinical performance, with the aim of increasing cost-effectiveness and safe care of patients. The funnel plot is a popular tool in visualizing the performance of a healthcare center in relation to other centers and to a target, taking into account statistical uncertainty. In this paper, we develop a methodology for constructing funnel plots for survival data. The method takes into account censoring and can deal with differences in censoring distributions across centers. Practical issues in implementing the methodology are discussed, particularly in the setting of benchmarking clinical outcomes for hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. A simulation study is performed to assess the performance of the funnel plots under several scenarios. Our methodology is illustrated using data from the European Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation benchmarking project. }
