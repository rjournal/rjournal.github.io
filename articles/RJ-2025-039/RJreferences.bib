  abstract = {Rare Event Simulation In a probabilistic model, a rare event is an event with a very small probability of occurrence. The forecasting of rare events is a formidable task but is important in many areas. For instance a catastrophic failure in a transport system or in a nuclear power plant, the failure of an information processing system in a bank, or in the communication network of a group of banks, leading to financial losses. Being able to evaluate the probability of rare events is therefore a critical issue. Monte Carlo Methods, the simulation of corresponding models, are used to analyze rare events. This book sets out to present the mathematical tools available for the efficient simulation of rare events. Importance sampling and splitting are presented along with an exposition of how to apply these tools to a variety of fields ranging from performance and dependability evaluation of complex systems, typically in computer science or in telecommunications, to chemical reaction analysis in biology or particle transport in physics. Graduate students, researchers and practitioners who wish to learn and apply rare event simulation techniques will find this book beneficial.},

The science of complex systems offers a useful paradigm for studying patterns of psychopathology and the development of more functional patterns in psychotherapy. Some basic principles of change are presented from subdisciplines of complexity science that are particularly relevant to psychotherapy: dynamical systems theory, synergetics, and network theory. Two early warning signs of system transition that have been identified across sciences (critical fluctuations and critical slowing) are also described. The network destabilization and transition (NDT) model of therapeutic change is presented as a conceptual framework to import these principles to psychotherapy research and to suggest future research directions.},

  abstract = {Mechanical bistable structures have two stable equilibria and can transit between them under external stimuli. Due to their unique behaviors such as snap-through and substantial shape changes, bistable structures exhibit unprecedented properties compared to conventional structures and thus have found applications in various fields such as soft robots, morphing wings and logic units. To quantitatively predict the performance of bistable structures in these applications, it is desirable to acquire information about the minimum energy barrier and an energy-efficient transition path between the two stable states. However, there is still a general lack of efficient methodologies to obtain this information, particularly for elastic continua with complicated, unintuitive transition paths. To overcome this challenge, here we integrate energy landscape exploration algorithms into finite element method (FEM). We first utilize the binary image transition state search (BITSS) method to identify the saddle point and then perform nudged elastic band (NEB) calculations with an initial guess based on the BITSS results to find the minimum energy path (MEP). This integrated strategy greatly helps the convergence of MEP calculations, which are highly nonlinear. Two representative cases are studied, including bistable buckled beams and a bistable unit of mechanical metamaterials, and the numerical results agree well with the previous works. Importantly, we numerically predict the complicated MEP of an asymmetric bistable unit of mechanical metamaterials and use experiments to demonstrate that following this MEP leads to successful transition between stable states while intuitive uniaxial compression fails to do so. Our work provides an effective numerical platform for identifying the minimum energy barrier and energy-efficient transition path of a bistable continuum, which can offer valuable guidance to the design of actuators, damping structures, energy harvesters, and mechanical metamaterials.},
