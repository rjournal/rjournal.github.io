It is shown to outperform all other known community detection methods in terms of computation time. Moreover, the quality of the communities detected is very good, as measured by the so-called modularity. This is shown first by identifying language communities in a Belgian mobile phone network of 2 million customers and by analysing a web graph of 118 million nodes and more than one billion links. The accuracy of our algorithm is also verified on ad hoc modular networks.}

One of the most relevant features of graphs representing real systems is community structure, or clustering, i.e. the organization of vertices in clusters, with many edges joining vertices of the same cluster and comparatively few edges joining vertices of different clusters. Such clusters, or communities, can be considered as fairly independent compartments of a graph, playing a similar role like, e.g., the tissues or the organs in the human body. Detecting communities is of great importance in sociology, biology and computer science, disciplines where systems are often represented as graphs. This problem is very hard and not yet satisfactorily solved, despite the huge effort of a large interdisciplinary community of scientists working on it over the past few years. We will attempt a thorough exposition of the topic, from the definition of the main elements of the problem, to the presentation of most methods developed, with a special focus on techniques designed by statistical physicists, from the discussion of crucial issues like the significance of clustering and how methods should be tested and compared against each other, to the description of applications to real networks.},

One of the most important features in these networks is the existence of community structure. In recent years, many community detection algorithms have been proposed to unveil the structural properties and dynamic behaviors of networks. In this study, we attempt a contemporary survey on the methods of community detection and its applications in the various domains of real life. Besides highlighting the strengths and weaknesses of each community detection approach, different aspects of algorithmic performance comparison and their testing on standard benchmarks are discussed. The challenges faced by community detection algorithms, open issues and future trends related to community detection are also postulated. The main goal of this paper is to put forth a review of prevailing community detection algorithms that range from traditional algorithms to state of the art algorithms for overlapping community detection. Algorithms based on dimensionality reduction techniques such as non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) and principal component analysis (PCA) are also focused. This study will serve as an up-to-date report on the evolution of community detection and its potential applications in various domains from real world networks.},
