	abstract = {This paper presents an investigation of a method for minimizing functions of several parameters where the function need not be computed precisely. Motivated by problems requiring the optimization of negative log-likelihoods, we also want to estimate the (inverse) Hessian at the point of minimum. The imprecision of the function values impedes the application of conventional optimization methods, and the goal of Hessian estimation adds a lot to the difficulty of developing an algorithm. The present class of methods is based on statistical approximation of the functional surface by a quadratic model, so is similar in motivation to many conventional techniques. The present work attempts to classify both problems and algorithmic tools in an effort to prescribe suitable techniques in a variety of situations.

Following a gentle introduction to latent variable modeling, the authors clearly explain and contrast a wide range of estimation and prediction methods from biostatistics, psychometrics, econometrics, and statistics. They present exciting and realistic applications that demonstrate how researchers can use latent variable modeling to solve concrete problems in areas as diverse as medicine, economics, and psychology. The examples considered include many nonstandard response types, such as ordinal, nominal, count, and survival data. Joint modeling of mixed responses, such as survival and longitudinal data, is also illustrated. Numerous displays, figures, and graphs make the text vivid and easy to read.

	abstract = {Alzheimer's disease gradually affects several components including the cerebral dimension with brain atrophies, the cognitive dimension with a decline in various functions, and the functional dimension with impairment in the daily living activities. Understanding how such dimensions interconnect is crucial for Alzheimer's disease research. However, it requires to simultaneously capture the dynamic and multidimensional aspects and to explore temporal relationships between dimensions. We propose an original dynamic structural model that accounts for all these features. The model defines dimensions as latent processes and combines a multivariate linear mixed model and a system of difference equations to model trajectories and temporal relationships between latent processes in finely discrete time. Dimensions are simultaneously related to their observed (possibly multivariate) markers through nonlinear equations of observation. Parameters are estimated in the maximum likelihood framework enjoying a closed form for the likelihood. We demonstrate in a simulation study that this dynamic model in discrete time benefits the same causal interpretation of temporal relationships as models defined in continuous time as long as the discretization step remains small. The model is then applied to the data of the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative. Three longitudinal dimensions (cerebral anatomy, cognitive ability, and functional autonomy) measured by six markers are analyzed, and their temporal structure is contrasted between different clinical stages of Alzheimer's disease.},

Thus an iteration of this algorithm requires much less computations than an iteration of the Newton-Raphson algorithm. Moreover this estimate of the variance of the score estimates the information matrix at maximum. We have also studied a convergence criterion which has the nice interpretation of estimating the ratio of the approximation error over the statistical error; thus it can be used for stopping the iterative process whatever the problem. A simulation study conﬁrms that the RVS algorithm is faster than the Marquardt algorithm (a robust version of the Newton-Raphson algorithm); this happens because the number of iterations needed by the RVS algorithm is barely larger than that needed by the Marquardt algorithm while the computation time for each iteration is much shorter. Also the coverage rates using the matrix G are satisfactory.},

Multivariate models with general covariance structure are often difficult to apply to highly unbalanced data, whereas two-stage random-effects models can be used easily. In two-stage models, the probability distributions for the response vectors of different individuals belong to a single family, but some random-effects parameters vary across individuals, with a distribution specified at the second stage. A general family of models is discussed, which includes both growth models and repeated-measures models as special cases. A unified approach to fitting these models, based on a combination of empirical Bayes and maximum likelihood estimation of model parameters and using the EM algorithm, is discussed. Two examples are taken from a current epidemiological study of the health effects of air pollution.},

	abstract = {Most statistical developments in the joint modelling area have focused on the shared random-effect models that include characteristics of the longitudinal marker as predictors in the model for the time-to-event. A less well-known approach is the joint latent class model which consists in assuming that a latent class structure entirely captures the correlation between the longitudinal marker trajectory and the risk of the event. Owing to its flexibility in modelling the dependency between the longitudinal marker and the event time, as well as its ability to include covariates, the joint latent class model may be particularly suited for prediction problems. This article aims at giving an overview of joint latent class modelling, especially in the prediction context. The authors introduce the model, discuss estimation and goodness-of-fit, and compare it with the shared random-effect model. Then, dynamic predictive tools derived from joint latent class models, as well as measures to evaluate their dynamic predictive accuracy, are presented. A detailed illustration of the methods is given in the context of the prediction of prostate cancer recurrence after radiation therapy based on repeated measures of Prostate Specific Antigen.},

We formulate the derivatives for both maximum likelihood and restricted maximum likelihood estimation and propose improvements to the algorithm discussed by Jennrich and Schlüchter (1986) to speed convergence and ensure a positive-definite covariance matrix for the random effects at each iteration. We use matrix decompositions to develop efficient and computationally stable implementations of both the NR algorithm and an EM algorithm (Laird and Ware 1982) for this model. We compare the two methods (EM vs. NR) in terms of computational order and performance on two sample data sets and conclude that in most situations a well-implemented NR algorithm is preferable to the EM algorithm or EM algorithm with Aitken's acceleration. The term repeated measures refers to experimental designs where there are several individuals and several measurements taken on each individual. In the mixed-effects model each individual's vector of responses is modeled as a parametric function, where some of the parameters or “effects” are random variables with a multivariate normal distribution. This model has been successful because it can handle unbalanced data (different designs for different individuals), missing data (observations on all individuals are taken at the same design points, but some individuals have missing data), and jointly dependent random effects. The price for this flexibility is that the parameter estimates may be difficult to compute. We propose some new methods for implementing the EM and NR algorithms and draw conclusions about their performance. We also discuss extensions of the mixed-effects model to incoporate nonindependent conditional error structure and nested-type designs.},

This heterogeneous linear mixed model relaxes the classical Gaussian assumption for the random effects and, when used for longitudinal data, can highlight distinct patterns of evolution. The observed likelihood is maximized using a Marquardt algorithm instead of the EM algorithm which is frequently used for mixture models. Indeed, the EM algorithm is computationally expensive and does not provide good convergence criteria nor direct estimates of the variance of the parameters. The proposed method also allows to classify subjects according to the estimated profiles by computing posterior probabilities of belonging to each component. The use of heterogeneous linear mixed model is illustrated through a study of the different patterns of cognitive evolution in the elderly.
