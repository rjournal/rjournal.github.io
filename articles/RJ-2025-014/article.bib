 abstract = {The YUIMA Project is an open source and collaborative effort aimed at developing the R package yuima for simulation and inference of stochastic differential equations. In the yuima package stochastic differential equations can be of very abstract type, multidimensional, driven by Wiener process or fractional Brownian motion with general Hurst parameter, with or without jumps specified as LÃ©vy noise. The yuima package is intended to offer the basic infrastructure on which complex models and inference procedures can be built on. This paper explains the design of the yuima package and provides some examples of applications.},

  abstract = {Time series observed at higher frequencies than monthly frequency display complex seasonal patterns that result from the combination of multiple seasonal patterns (with annual, monthly, weekly and daily periodicities) and varying periods, due to the irregularity of the calendar. Seasonality in high frequency data is modelled from two main perspectives: the stochastic harmonic approach, based on the Fourier representation of a periodic function, and the time-domain random effects approach. An encompassing representation illustrates the conditions under which they are equivalent. Three major challenges are considered: the first deals with modelling the effect of moving festivals, holidays and other breaks due to the calendar. Secondly, robust estimation and filtering methods are needed to tackle the level of outlier contamination, which is typically high, due to the lower level of temporal aggregation and the raw nature of the data. Finally, model selection strategies play an important role, as the number of harmonic or random components that are needed to account for the complexity of seasonality can be very large.},

@article{GroSch10,
  abstract = {Student's t-distributions are widely used in financial studies as heavy-tailed alternatives to normal distributions. As these distributions are not closed under convolution, there exist no L{\'e}vy processes with Student's t-marginals at all points in time. In this article we show that a Student's t-approximation of these marginals is still suitable, while not exact. Using this approximation, we are able to describe the scaling behavior of such L{\'e}vy--Student processes and the parameters of its marginal distributions by a simple analytical scaling law. This scaling law drastically simplifies the use of L{\'e}vy--Student processes as a general diffusion process in various interdisciplinary applications. We explicitly provide an application in the context of modelling high-frequency price returns.},
