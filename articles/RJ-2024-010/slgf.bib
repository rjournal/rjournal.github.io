  abstract  = {Bayesian comparison of models is achieved simply by calculation of posterior probabilities of the models themselves. However, there are difficulties with this approach when prior information about the parameters of the various models is weak. Partial Bayes factors offer a resolution of the problem by setting aside part of the data as a training sample. The training sample is used to obtain an initial informative posterior distribution of the parameters in each model. Model comparison is then based on a Bayes factor calculated from the remaining data. Properties of partial Bayes factors are discussed, particularly in the context of weak prior information, and they are found to have advantages over other proposed methods of model comparison. A new variant of the partial Bayes factor, the fractional Bayes factor, is advocated on grounds of consistency, simplicity, robustness and coherence.},

For the particular prior distributions utilized, it is found that the posterior odds ratios can be well approximated by functions that are monotonic in usual sampling theoryF statistics. Some implications of this finding and the relation of our work to the pioneering work of Jeffreys and others are considered. Tabulations of odds ratios are provided and discussed.",

abstract = {A class of Item Response Theory (IRT) models for binary and ordinal polytomous items is illustrated and an R package for dealing with these models, named MultiLCIRT, is described. The models at issue extend traditional IRT models allowing for multidimensionality and discreteness of latent traits. They also allow for different parameterizations of the conditional distribution of the response variables given the latent traits, depending on both the type of link function and constraints imposed on the discriminating and difficulty item parameters. These models may be estimated by maximum likelihood via an Expectationâ€“Maximization algorithm, which is implemented in the MultiLCIRT package. Issues related to model selection are also discussed in detail. In order to illustrate this package, two datasets are analyzed: one concerning binary items and referred to the measurement of ability in mathematics and the other one coming from the administration of ordinal polytomous items for the assessment of anxiety and depression. In the first application, aggregation of items in homogeneous groups is illustrated through a model-based hierarchical clustering procedure which is implemented in the proposed package. In the second application, the steps to select a specific model having the best fit in the class of IRT models at issue are described.}
