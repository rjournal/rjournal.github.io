\abstract{%
A guided tour helps to visualise high-dimensional data by showing
low-dimensional projections along a projection pursuit optimisation
path. Projection pursuit is a generalisation of principal component
analysis in the sense that different indexes are used to define the
interestingness of the projected data. While much work has been done in
developing new indexes in the literature, less has been done on
understanding the optimisation. Index functions can be noisy, might have
multiple local maxima as well as an optimal maximum, and are constrained
to generate orthonormal projection frames, which complicates the
optimization. In addition, projection pursuit is primarily used for
exploratory data analysis, and finding the local maxima is also useful.
The guided tour is especially useful for exploration because it conducts
geodesic interpolation connecting steps in the optimisation and shows
how the projected data changes as a maxima is approached. This work
provides new visual diagnostics for examining a choice of optimisation
procedure based on the provision of a new data object which collects
information throughout the optimisation. It has helped to diagnose and
fix several problems with projection pursuit guided tour. This work
might be useful more broadly for diagnosing optimisers and comparing
their performance. The diagnostics are implemented in the R package

\section{Introduction}\label{introduction}}

Visualisation is widely used in exploratory data analysis
\citep{tukey1977exploratory, unwin2015graphical, healy2018data, wilke2019fundamentals}.
Presenting information in graphics often unveils insights that would
otherwise not be discovered and provides a more comprehensive
understanding of the problem at hand. Task-specific tools such as
\citet{li2020visualizing} show how visualisation can be used to
understand, for instance, the behaviour of the optimisation for the
example of neural network classification models. However, no general
visualisation tool is available for diagnosing optimisation procedures.
The work presented in this paper brings visualization tools into
optimisation problems with the aim to better understand the performance
of optimisers in practice.

The focus of this paper is on the optimisation problem arising in the
projection pursuit guided tour \citep{buja2005computational}, an
exploratory data analysis technique used for detecting interesting
structures in high-dimensional data through a set of lower-dimensional
projections \citep{cook2008grand}. The goal of the optimisation is to
identify the projection, represented by the projection matrix, that
gives the most interesting low-dimensional view. A view is said to be
interesting if it can show some structures of the data that depart from
normality, such as bimodality, clustering, or outliers.

The optimization challenges encountered in the projection pursuit guided
tour problem are common to those of optimization in general. Examples
include the existence of multiple optima (local and global), the
trade-off between computational burden and proximity to the optima, or
dealing with noisy objective functions that might be non-smooth and
non-differentiable \citep{jones1998efficient}. The visualization tools,
optimization methods, and conceptual framework presented in this paper
can therefore be applied to other optimization problems.

The remainder of the paper is organised as follows. The next section
provides an overview of optimisation methods, specifically random search
and line search methods. A review of the projection pursuit guided tour,
an overview of the optimisation problem and, outlines of three existing
algorithms follows. The third section presents the new visual
diagnostics, including the design of a data structure to capture
information during the optimisation, from which several diagnostic plots
are created. An illustration of how the diagnostic plots can be used to
examine the performance of different optimisers and guide improvements
to existing algorithms is shown using simulated data. Finally, an
explanation of the implementation in the R package, \CRANpkg{ferrn}
\citep{ferrn}, is provided.

\hypertarget{optim}{%
\section{Optimisation methods}\label{optim}}

The type of optimisation problem considered in this paper is constrained
optimization \citep{bertsekas2014constrained}, assuming it is not
possible to find a solution to the problem in the way of a closed-form.
That is, the problem consists in finding the minimum or maximum of a
function \(f \in L^p\) in the constrained space \(\mathcal{A}\), where
\(L^p\) defines the vector space of function \(f\), whose \(p\)th power
is integrable.

Gradient-based methods are commonly used to optimise an objective
function, with the most notable one being the gradient ascent (descent)
method. Although these methods are popular, they rely on the
availability of the objective function derivatives. As will be shown in
the next section, the independent variables in our optimisation problem
are the entries of a projection matrix, and the computational time
required to perform differentiation on a matrix could impede the
rendering of tour animation. In addition, some objective functions rely
on the empirical distribution of the data, which makes it in general not
possible to get the gradient. Hence, gradient-based methods are not the
focus of this paper, and consideration will be given to derivative-free
methods.

Derivative-free methods
\citep{conn2009introduction, rios2013derivative}, which do not rely on
the knowledge of the gradient, are more generally applicable.
Derivative-free methods have been developed over the years, where the
emphasis is on finding, in most cases, a near-optimal solution. Here we
consider three derivative-free methods, two of which are random search
methods: creeping random search and simulated annealing, and the other
one is pseudo-derivative search.

Random search methods
\citep{Romeijn2009, zabinsky2013stochastic, andradottir2015review} have
a random sampling component as part of their algorithms and have been
shown to have the ability to optimise non-convex and non-smooth
functions. The initial random search algorithm, pure random search
\citep{Brooks1958-zk}, draws candidate points from the entire space
without using any information of the current position and updates the
current position when an improvement on the objective function is made.
As the dimension of the space becomes larger, sufficient sampling from
the entire space would require a long time for convergence to occur,
despite a guaranteed global convergence \citep{spall2005introduction}.
Various algorithms have thus been developed to improve pure random
search by either concentrating on a narrower sampling space or using a
different updating mechanism. Creeping random search
\citep{White1971-ci} is such a variation, where a candidate point is
generated within a neighbourhood of the current point. This makes
creeping random search faster to compute but global convergence is no
longer guaranteed. On the other hand, simulated annealing
\citep{kirkpatrick1983optimization, bertsimas1993simulated}, introduces
a different updating mechanism. Rather than only updating the current
point when an improvement is made, it uses a Metropolis acceptance
criterion, where worse candidates still have a chance to be accepted.
The convergence of simulated annealing algorithms has been widely
researched \citep{mitra1986convergence, granville1994simulated} and the
global optimum can be attained under mild regularity conditions.

The pseudo-derivative search uses a common search scheme in
optimisation: line search. In line search methods, users are required to
provide an initial estimate \(x_{1}\) and, at each iteration, a search
direction \(S_k\) and a step size \(\alpha_k\) are generated. Then one
moves on to the next point following \(x_{k+1} = x_k + \alpha_kS_k\) and
the process is repeated until the desired convergence is reached. In
derivative-free methods, local information of the objective function is
used to determine the search direction. The choice of step size also
needs consideration, as inadequate step sizes might prevent the
optimisation method from converging to an optimum. An ideal step size
can be chosen by finding the value of \(\alpha_k \in \mathbb{R}\) that
maximises \(f(x_k + \alpha_kS_k)\) with respect to \(\alpha_k\) at each
iteration.

\section{Projection pursuit guided
tour}\label{projection-pursuit-guided-tour}}

A projection pursuit guided tour combines two different methods
(projection pursuit and guided tour) to explore interesting features in
a high-dimensional space. Projection pursuit, coined by
\citet{friedman1974projection}, detects interesting structures (e.g.,
clustering, outliers, and skewness) in multivariate data via
low-dimensional projections. Guided tour \citep{cook1995grand} is one
variation of a broader class of data visualisation methods, tour
\citep{buja2005computational}, which displays high-dimensional data
through a series of animated projections.

Let \(\mathbf{X}_{n \times p}\) be the data matrix with \(n\)
observations in \(p\) dimensions. A \(d\)-dimensional projection is a
linear transformation from \(\mathbb{R}^p\) into \(\mathbb{R}^d\)
defined as \(\mathbf{Y} = \mathbf{X} \cdot \mathbf{A}\), where
\(\mathbf{Y}_{n \times d}\) is the projected data and
\(\mathbf{A}_{p\times d}\) is the projection matrix. We define
\(f: \mathbb{R}^{n \times d} \mapsto \mathbb{R}\) to be an index
function that maps the projected data \(\mathbf{Y}\) onto a scalar
value. This is commonly known as the projection pursuit index function,
or just index function, and is used to measure the ``interestingness''
of a given projection. An interesting projection shows structures that
are non-normal since theoretical proofs from
\citet{diaconis1984asymptotics} have shown that projections tend to be
normal as \(n\) and \(p\) approach infinity under certain conditions.
There have been many index functions proposed in the literature, here
are a few examples: early indexes that can be categorised as measuring
the \(L^2\) distance between the projection and a normal distribution:
Legendre index \citep{friedman1974projection}; Hermite index
\citep{hall1989polynomial}; natural Hermite index
\citep{cook1993projection}; chi-square index \citep{posse1995projection}
for detecting spiral structure; LDA index \citep{lee2005projection} and
PDA \citep{lee2010projection} index for supervised classification;
kurtosis index \citep{Loperfido2020} and skewness index
\citep{Loperfido2018} for detecting outliers in financial time series;
and most recently, scagnostic indexes \citep{laa2020using} for
summarising structures in scatterplot matrices based on eight scagnostic
measures \citep{scag, WW08}.

As a general visualisation method, tour produces animations of
high-dimensional data via rotations of low-dimensional planes. There are
different versions depending on how the high-dimensional space is
investigated: grand tour \citep{cook2008grand} selects the planes
randomly to provide a general overview; manual tour
\citep{cook1997manual} gradually phases in and out one variable to
understand the contribution of that variable in the projection. Guided
tour, the main interest of this paper, chooses the planes with the aid
of projection pursuit to gradually reveal the most interesting
projection. Given a random start, projection pursuit iteratively finds
bases with higher index values, and the guided tour constructs a
geodesic interpolation between these planes to form a tour path. Figure
\ref{fig:tour-path} shows a sketch of the tour path where the blue
squares represent planes (targets) selected by the projection pursuit
optimisation, and the white squares represent planes in the geodesic
interpolation between targets. Mathematical details of the geodesic
interpolation can be found in \citet{buja2005computational}. (Note that
the term \emph{frame} used in Buja's paper refers to a particular set of
orthonormal vectors defining a plane. This is also conventionally
referred to as a basis, which is used in this paper and the associated
software.) The aforementioned tour method has been implemented in the R
package \CRANpkg{tourr} \citep{tourr}.

\hypertarget{tour-optim}{%
\subsection{Optimisation in the tour}\label{tour-optim}}

In projection pursuit, the optimisation aims at finding the global and
local maxima that give interesting projections according to an index
function. That is, it starts with a given randomly selected basis
\(\mathbf{A}_1\) and aims at finding an optimal final projection basis
\(\mathbf{A}_T\) that satisfies the following optimisation problem:

\begin{align}
\arg \max_{\mathbf{A} \in \mathcal{A}} f(\mathbf{X} \cdot \mathbf{A})  ~~~ s.t. ~~~ \mathbf{A}^{\prime} \mathbf{A} = I_d \,,
\end{align}

\noindent where \(f\) and \(\mathbf{X}\) are defined as in the previous
section, \(\mathcal{A}\) is the set of all \(p\)-dimensional projection
bases, \(I_d\) is the \(d\)-dimensional identity matrix, and the
constraint ensures the projection bases, \(\mathbf{A}\), to be
orthonormal. It is worth noticing the following: 1) The optimisation is
constrained, and the orthonormality constraint imposes a geometrical
structure on the bases space: it forms a Stiefel manifold. 2) There may
be index functions for which the objective function might not be
differentiable. 3) While finding the global optimum is the goal of the
optimisation problem, interesting projections may also appear in the
local optimum. 4) The optimisation should be fast to compute since the
tour animation is viewed by the users during the optimisation.

\hypertarget{existing-algorithms}{%
\subsection{Existing algorithms}\label{existing-algorithms}}

Three optimisers have been implemented in the \pkg{tourr} \citep{tourr}
package: creeping random search (CRS), simulated annealing (SA), and
pseudo-derivative (PD). Creeping random search (CRS) is a random search
optimiser that samples a candidate basis \(\mathbf{A}_{l}\) in the
neighbourhood of the current basis \(\mathbf{A}_{\text{cur}}\) by
\(\mathbf{A}_{l} = (1- \alpha)\mathbf{A}_{\text{cur}} + \alpha \mathbf{A}_{\text{rand}}\)
where \(\alpha \in [0,1]\) controls the radius of the sampling
neighbourhood and \(\mathbf{A}_{\text{rand}}\) is generated randomly.
\(\mathbf{A}_{l}\) is then orthonormalised to fulfil the basis
constraint. If \(\mathbf{A}_{l}\) has an index value higher than the
current basis \(\mathbf{A}_{\text{cur}}\), the optimiser outputs
\(\mathbf{A}_{l}\) for a guided tour to construct an interpolation path.
The neighbourhood parameter \(\alpha\) is adjusted by a cooling
parameter: \(\alpha_{j+1} = \alpha_j * \text{cooling}\) before the next
iteration starts. The optimiser terminates when the maximum number of
iteration \(l_{\max}\) is reached before a better basis can be found.
The algorithm of CRS can be found in the appendix.
\citet{posse1995projection} has proposed a slightly different cooling
scheme by introducing a halving parameter \(c\). In his proposal,
\(\alpha\) is only adjusted if the last iteration takes more than \(c\)
times to find a better basis.

Simulated annealing (SA) uses the same sampling process as CRS but
allows a probabilistic acceptance of a basis with lower index value than
the current one. Given an initial value of \(T_0 \in \mathbb{R^{+}}\),
the ``temperature'' at iteration \(l\) is defined as
\(T(l) = \frac{T_0}{\log(l + 1)}\). When a candidate basis fails to have
an index value larger than the current basis, SA gives it a second
chance to be accepted with probability
\[P= \min\left\{\exp\left[-\frac{\mid I_{\text{cur}} - I_{l} \mid}{T(l)}\right],1\right\} \,,\]
where \(I_{(\cdot)} \in \mathbb{R}\) denotes the index value of a given
basis. This implementation allows the optimiser to make a move and
explore the basis space even if the candidate basis does not have a
higher index value. Hence it enables the optimiser to jump out of a
local optimum. The second algorithm in the appendix highlights how SA
differs from CRS in the inner loop.

Pseudo-derivative (PD) search uses a different strategy than CRS and SA.
Rather than randomly sample the basis space, PD first computes a search
direction by evaluating bases close to the current basis. The step size
is then chosen along the corresponding geodesic by another optimisation
over a 90 degree angle from \(-\pi/4\) to \(\pi/4\). The resulting
candidate basis \(\mathbf{A}_{**}\) is returned for the current
iteration if it has a higher index value than the current one. The third
algorithm in the appendix summarises the inner loop of the PD.

\hypertarget{vis-diag}{%
\section{Visual diagnostics}\label{vis-diag}}

A data structure for diagnosing optimisers in projection pursuit guided
tour is first defined. With this data structure, four types of
diagnostic plots are presented.

\hypertarget{data-structure-for-diagnostics}{%
\subsection{Data structure for
diagnostics}\label{data-structure-for-diagnostics}}

Three main pieces of information are recorded during the projection
pursuit optimisation: 1) projection bases \(\mathbf{A}\), 2) index
values \(I\), and 3) state \(S\). For CRS and SA, possible states
include \texttt{random\_search}, \texttt{new\_basis}, and
\texttt{interpolation}. Pseudo-derivative (PD) has a wider variety of
states, including \texttt{new\_basis}, \texttt{direction\_search},
\texttt{best\_direction\_search}, \texttt{best\_line\_search}, and
\texttt{interpolation}. Multiple iterators index the information
collected at different levels: \(t\) is a unique identifier prescribing
the natural ordering of each observation; \(j\) and \(l\) are the
counter of the outer and inner loop, respectively. Other parameters of
interest recorded, \(V\), include \texttt{method} that tags the name of
the optimiser, and \texttt{alpha} that indicates the sampling
neighbourhood size for searching observations. A matrix notation
describing the data structure is:

\noindent where \(T^{\prime} = T + k_{J}+ l_{J+1}\). Note that there is
no output in iteration \(J + 1\) since the optimiser does not find a
better basis in the last iteration and terminates. The final basis found
is \(A_T\) with index value \(I_T\).

The data structure constructed above meets the tidy data principle
\citep{wickham2014tidy} that requires each observation to form a row and
each variable to form a column. With tidy data structure, data wrangling
and visualisation can be significantly simplified by well-developed
packages such as \CRANpkg{dplyr} \citep{dplyr} and \CRANpkg{ggplot2}
\citep{ggplot2}.

\hypertarget{diagnostic-1-checking-how-hard-the-optimiser-is-working}{%
\subsection{Diagnostic 1: Checking how hard the optimiser is
working}\label{diagnostic-1-checking-how-hard-the-optimiser-is-working}}

A starting point of diagnosing an optimiser is to understand how many
searches it has conducted, i.e., we want to summarise how the index is
increasing over iterations and how many basis need to be sampled at each
iteration. This is achieved using the function
\texttt{explore\_trace\_search()}: a boxplot shows the distribution of
index values for each try, where the accepted basis (corresponding to
the highest index value) is always shown as a point. When there are only
few tries at a given iteration, showing the data points directly is
preferred over the boxplot and this is controlled via the
\texttt{cutoff} argument. Additional annotations are added to facilitate
better reading of the plot, and these include 1) the number of points
searched in each iteration can be added as text label at the bottom of
each iteration; 2) the anchor bases to interpolate are connected and
highlighted in a larger size; 3) the colour of the last iteration is in
greyscale to indicate no better basis found in this iteration.

Figure \ref{fig:toy-search} shows an example of the search plot for CRS
(left) and SA (right). Both optimisers quickly find better bases in the
first few iterations and then take longer to find one in the later
iterations. The anchor bases, the ones found with the highest index
value in each iteration, always have an increased index value in the
optimiser CRS while this is not the case for SA. This feature gives CRS
an advantage in this simple example to quickly find the optimum.

Both optimisers reach the final basis with a similar index value, while it takes SA longer to find the final basis. In the earlier iterations, optimisers quickly find a better basis to proceed, while in the later iterations, most sampled bases fail to make an improvement on the index value, and a boxplot is used to summarise the distribution of the index values. There is no better basis found in the last iteration, 9 (left) and 15 (right), before reaching the maximum number of try and hence it is coloured grey. The colour scale is from the customised botanical palette in the **ferrn** package.}\label{fig:toy-search}
\end{figure}
\end{Schunk}

\hypertarget{toy-interp}{%
\subsection{Diagnostic 2: Examining the optimisation
progress}\label{toy-interp}}

Another interesting feature to examine is the changes in the index value
between interpolating bases since the projection on these bases is shown
in the tour animation. Trace plots are created by plotting the index
value against time. Figure \ref{fig:toy-interp} presents the trace plot
of the same optimisations as Figure \ref{fig:toy-search}, and one can
observe that the trace is smooth in both cases. It may seem bizarre at
first sight that the interpolation sometimes passes bases with higher
index values before it decreases to a lower target. This happens
because, on the one hand, the probabilistic acceptance in SA implies
that some worse bases will be accepted by the optimiser. In addition,
the guided tour interpolates between the current and target basis to
provide a smooth transition between projections, and sometimes a higher
index value will be observed along the interpolation path. This
indicates that a non-monotonic interpolation cannot be avoided, even for
CRS. Later, in Section \emph{A problem of non-monotonicity}, there will
be a discussion on improving the non-monotonic interpolation for CRS.

Interpolation in both optimisation is smooth, while SA is observed to first pass by some bases with higher index values before reaching the target bases in time 76-130.}\label{fig:toy-interp}
\end{figure}
\end{Schunk}

\hypertarget{toy-pca}{%
\subsection{Diagnostic 3a: Understanding the optimiser's coverage of the
search space}\label{toy-pca}}

Apart from checking the search and progression of an optimiser, looking
at where the bases are positioned in the basis space is also of
interest. Given the orthonormality constraint, the space of projection
bases \(\mathbf{A}_{p \times d}\) is a Stiefel manifold. For
one-dimensional projections, this forms a \(p\)-dimensional sphere. A
dimensionality reduction method, e.g., principal component analysis, is
applied to first project all the bases onto a 2D space. In a projection
pursuit guided tour optimisation, there are various types of bases
involved: 1) The starting basis; 2) The search bases that the optimiser
evaluated to produce the anchor bases; 3) The anchor bases that have the
highest index value in each iteration; 4) The interpolating bases on the
interpolation path; and finally, 5) the end basis. The importance of
these bases differs but the most important ones are the starting,
interpolating, and end bases. Sometimes, two optimisers can start with
the same basis but finish with bases of opposite signs. This happens
because the projection is invariant to the orientation of the basis, and
so is the index value. However, this creates difficulties for comparing
the optimisers since the end bases will be symmetric to the origin. A
sign flipping step is conducted to flip the signs of all the bases in
one routine if different optimisations finish at opposite places.

Several annotations have been made to help understand this plot. As
mentioned previously, the original basis space is a high-dimensional
sphere, and random bases on the sphere can be generated via the
\CRANpkg{geozoo} \citep{geozoo} package. We use PCA to project and
visualize the parameters/ bases in 2D. The centre of the 2D view is the
first two PCs of the data matrix. It theoretically should be a circle
but may have some irregular edges due to finite sampling. Thus the edge
is smoothed by using a radius estimated as the largest distance from the
centre to any basis. In the simulation, the theoretical best basis is
known and can be labelled to compare how close to this that the
optimisers stopped. Various aesthetics, i.e., size, alpha
(transparency), and colour, are applicable to emphasize critical
elements and adjust for the presentation. For example, anchor points and
search points are less important, and hence a smaller size and alpha are
used. Alpha can also be applied on the interpolation paths to show start
to finish from transparent to opaque.

Figure \ref{fig:toy-pca} shows the PCA plot of CRS and PD for a 1D
projection problem. Both optimisers find the optimum, but PD gets
closer. With the PCA plot, one can visually appreciate the nature of
these two optimisers: PD first evaluates points in a small neighbourhood
for a promising direction, while CRS evaluates points randomly in the
search space to search for the next target. There are dashed lines
annotated for CRS, and it describes the interruption of the
interpolation, which will be discussed in detail in Section \emph{A
problem of non-monotonicity}.

Animation is another type of display to show how the search progresses
from start to finish in the space. Figure \ref{fig:toy-pca-animated}
shows the animated version (six frames from the animation if viewed in
pdf) of the PCA plot in Figure \ref{fig:toy-pca}. An additional piece of
information one can learn from this animation is that CRS finds its end
basis quicker than PD since CRS finishes its search in the 5th frame
while PD is still making more progress.

As mentioned previously, the original \(p \times d\) dimension space can
be simulated via randomly generated bases in the \pkg{geozoo}
\citep{geozoo} package. While the PCA plot projects the bases from the
direction that maximises the variance, the tour plot displays the
original high-dimensional space from various directions using animation.
Figure \ref{fig:toy-tour} shows some frames from the tour plot of the
same two optimisations in its original space.

\hypertarget{diagnostic-4b-forming-a-torus}{%
\subsection{Diagnostic 4b: Forming a
torus}\label{diagnostic-4b-forming-a-torus}}

While the previous few examples have looked at the space of 1D basis in
a unit sphere, this section visualises the space of 2D basis. Recall
that the columns in a 2D basis are orthogonal to each other, so the
space of \(p \times 2\) bases is a torus in the \(p\)-D space
\citep{Buja1986-sw}. For \(p = 3\) one would see a classical 3D torus
shape as shown by the grey points in Figure \ref{fig:toy-torus}. The two
circles of the torus can be observed to be perpendicular to each other
and this can be linked back to the orthogonality condition. Two paths
from CRS and PD are plotted on top of the torus and coloured in green
and brown, respectively, to match the previous plots. The final basis
found by PD and CRS are shown in a larger shape and printed below,
respectively:

\begin{Schunk}
\begin{Soutput}

\end{Soutput}
\end{Schunk}

Both optimisers have found the third variable in the first direction and
the second variable in the second direction. Note, however, the
different orientation of the basis, following from the different sign in
the second column. One would expect to see this in the torus plot as the
final bases match each other when projected onto one torus circle (due
to the same sign in the first column) and are symmetric when projected
onto the other (due to the different sign in the second column). In
Figure \ref{fig:toy-torus}, this can be seen most clearly in frame 5
where the two circles are rotated into a line from our view.

\hypertarget{application}{%
\section{Diagnosing an optimiser}\label{application}}

In this section, several examples will be presented to show how the
diagnostic plots discover something unexpected in projection pursuit
optimisation, and guide the implementation of new features.

\hypertarget{simulation-setup}{%
\subsection{Simulation setup}\label{simulation-setup}}

Random variables with different distributions have been simulated as
follows:

\begin{align}
x_1 \overset{d}{=} x_8 \overset{d}{=} x_9 \overset{d}{=} x_{10}& \sim \mathcal{N}(0, 1) \\
x_2 &\sim 0.5 \mathcal{N}(-3, 1) + 0.5 \mathcal{N}(3, 1)\\
\Pr(x_3) &= 
\begin{cases}
0.5 & \text{if $x_3 = -1$ or $1$}\\
0 & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}\\
x_4 &\sim 0.25 \mathcal{N}(-3, 1) + 0.75 \mathcal{N}(3, 1)\\
x_5 &\sim \frac{1}{3} \mathcal{N}(-5, 1) + \frac{1}{3} \mathcal{N}(0, 1) + \frac{1}{3} \mathcal{N}(5, 1)\\
x_6 &\sim 0.45 \mathcal{N}(-5, 1) + 0.1 \mathcal{N}(0, 1) + 0.45 \mathcal{N}(5, 1)\\
x_7 &\sim 0.5 \mathcal{N}(-5, 1) + 0.5 \mathcal{N}(5, 1) 
\end{align}

\noindent Variables \texttt{x1}, \texttt{x8} to \texttt{x10} are normal
noise with zero mean, and unit variance and \texttt{x2} to \texttt{x7}
are normal mixtures with varied weights and locations. All the variables
have been scaled to have overall unit variance before projection
pursuit. The holes index \citep{cook2008grand}, used for detecting
bimodality of the variables, is used throughout the examples unless
otherwise specified.

\hypertarget{monotonic}{%
\subsection{A problem of non-monotonicity}\label{monotonic}}

An example of non-monotonic interpolation has been given in Figure
\ref{fig:toy-interp}: a path that passes bases with a higher index value
than the target one. For SA, a non-monotonic interpolation is justified
since target bases do not necessarily have a higher index value than the
current one, while this is not the case for CRS. The original trace plot
for a 2D projection problem, optimised by CRS, is shown on the left
panel of Figure \ref{fig:interruption}, and one can observe that the
non-monotonic interpolation has undermined the optimiser to realise its
full potential. Hence, an interruption is implemented to stop at the
best basis found in the interpolation. The right panel of Figure
\ref{fig:interruption} shows the trace plot after implementing the
interruption, and while the first two interpolations are identical, the
basis at time 61 has a higher index value than the target in the third
interpolation. Rather than starting the next iteration from the target
basis on time 65, CRS starts the next iteration at time 61 on the right
panel and reaches a better final basis.

\begin{Schunk}

On the left panel, the basis with a higher index value is found during the interpolation but not used. On the right panel, the interruption stops the interpolation at the basis with the highest index value for each iteration and results in a final basis with a higher index value, as shown on the right panel.}\label{fig:interruption}
\end{figure}
\end{Schunk}

\hypertarget{close-but-not-close-enough}{%
\subsection{Close but not close
enough}\label{close-but-not-close-enough}}

Once the final basis has been found by an optimiser, one may want to
push further in the close neighbourhood to see if an even better basis
can be found. A polish search takes the final basis of an optimiser as
the start of a new guided tour to search for local improvements. The
polish algorithm is similar to the CRS but with three distinctions: 1) a
hundred rather than one candidate bases are generated each time in the
inner loop; 2) the neighbourhood size is reduced in the inner loop,
rather than in the outer loop; and 3) three more termination conditions
have been added to ensure the new basis generated is distinguishable
from the current one in terms of the distance in the space, the relative
change in the index value, and neighbourhood size:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi})}
\tightlist
\item
  the distance between the basis found and the current needs to be
  larger than 1e-3;
\item
  the relative change of the index value needs to be larger than 1e-5;
  and
\item
  the alpha parameter needs to be larger than 0.01.
\end{enumerate}

Figure \ref{fig:polish} presents the projected data and trace plot of a
2D projection, optimised by CRS and followed by the polish step. The top
row shows the initial projection, the final projection after CRS, and
the final projection after polish, respectively. The end basis found by
CRS reveals the four clusters in the data, but the edges of each cluster
are not clean-cut. Polish works with this end basis and further pushes
the index value to produce clearer edges of the cluster, especially
along the vertical axis.

The clustering structure in the data is detected by CRS (top middle panel), but the polish step improves the index value and produces clearer boundaries of the clusters (top right panel), especially along the vertical axis. Note that the parameter \code{max.tries} is set to 400 in this experiment for CRS to do its best.}\label{fig:polish}
\end{figure}

\hypertarget{seeing-the-signal-in-the-noise}{%
\subsection{Seeing the signal in the
noise}\label{seeing-the-signal-in-the-noise}}

The holes index function used for all the examples before this section
produces a smooth interpolation, while this is not the case for all the
indexes. An example of a noisy index function for 1D projections
compares the projected data, \(\mathbf{Y}_{n \times 1}\), to a randomly
generated normal distribution, \(\mathcal{N}_{n \times 1}\), using the
Kolmogorov test. Let \(F_{.}(n)\) be the empirical cumulative
distribution function (ECDF) with two possible subscripts, \(Y\) and
\(\mathcal{N}\), representing the projected and randomly generated data,
and \(n\) denoting the number of observations, the Kolmogorov index
\(I^{nk}(n)\), is defined as:

\[I^{K}(n) = \max \left[F_{Y}(n) - F_{\mathcal{N}}(n)\right].\] With a
non-smooth index function, two research questions are raised:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi})}
\tightlist
\item
  whether any optimiser fails to optimise this non-smooth index; and
\item
  whether the optimisers can find the global optimum despite the
  presence of a local optimum.
\end{enumerate}

Figure \ref{fig:noisy-better-geo} presents the trace and PCA plots of
all three optimisers, and as expected, none of the interpolated paths
are smooth. There is barely any improvement made by PD, indicating its
failure in optimising non-smooth index functions. While CRS and SA have
managed to get close to the index value of the theoretical best, the
trace plot shows that it takes SA much longer to find the final basis.
This long interpolation path is partially due to the fluctuation in the
early iterations, where SA tends to generously accept inferior bases
before concentrating near the optimum. The PCA plot shows the
interpolation path and search points, excluding the last termination
iteration. Pseudo-Derivative (PD) quickly gets stuck near the starting
position. Comparing the amount of random search done by CRS and SA, it
is surprising that SA does not carry as many samples as CRS. Combining
the insights from both the trace and PCA plot, one can learn the two
different search strategies by CRS and SA: CRS frequently samples in the
space and only make a move when an improvement is guaranteed to be made,
while SA first broadly accepts bases in the space and then starts the
extensive sampling in a narrowed subspace. The specific decision of
which optimiser to use will depend on the index curve in the basis
space, but if the basis space is non-smooth, accepting inferior bases at
first, as SA has done here, can lead to a more efficient search in terms
of the overall number of points evaluated.

\begin{Schunk}
\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{figs/noisy-better-geo}

Both CRS and SA succeed in the optimisation, PD fails to optimise this non-smooth index. Further, SA takes  much longer than CRS to finish the optimisation, but finishes off closer to the theoretical best.}\label{fig:noisy-better-geo}
\end{figure}
\end{Schunk}

The next experiment compares the performance of CRS and SA when a local
maximum exists. Two search neighbourhood sizes, 0.5 and 0.7, are
compared to understand how a large search neighbourhood would affect the
final basis and the length of the search. Figure \ref{fig:kol-result}
shows 80 paths simulated using 20 seeds in the PCA plot, faceted by the
optimiser and search size. With CRS and a search size of 0.5, despite
being the simplest and fastest, the optimiser fails in three instances
where the final basis lands neither near the local nor the global
optimum. With a larger search size of 0.7, more seeds have found the
global maximum. Comparing CRS and SA for a search size of 0.5, SA does
not seem to improve the final basis found, despite having longer
interpolation paths. However, the denser paths near the local maximum
are an indicator that SA is working hard to examine if there is any
other optimum in the basis space, but the relatively small search size
has diminished its ability to reach the global maximum. With a larger
search size, almost all the seeds (16 out of 20) have found the global
maximum, and some final bases are much closer to the theoretical best,
as compared to the three other cases. This indicates that SA, with a
reasonable large search window, is able to overcome the local optimum
and optimise close towards the global optimum.

\hypertarget{reconciling-the-orientation}{%
\subsection{Reconciling the
orientation}\label{reconciling-the-orientation}}

One interesting situation observed in the previous examples is that, for
some simulations, as shown on the left panel of Figure
\ref{fig:flip-sign}, the target basis is generated on the other half of
the basis space, and the interpolator seems to draw a straight line to
interpolate. Bases with opposite signs do not affect the projection and
index value, but we would prefer the target to have the same orientation
as the current basis. The orientation of two bases can be
computationally checked by calculating the determinant -- a negative
value suggests the two bases have a different orientation. For 1D bases,
this can be corrected by flipping the sign on one basis. For higher
dimensions, it can be a bit more difficult because the orthonormality of
the basis needs to be also maintained when an individual vector is
flipped. Here, an orientation check is carried out once a new target
basis is generated, and the sign in the target basis will be flipped if
a negative determinant is obtained. The interpolation after implementing
the orientation check is shown on the right panel of Figure
\ref{fig:flip-sign}, where the unsatisfactory interpolation no longer
exists.

On the left panel, one target basis is generated with an opposite orientation to the current basis (hence appear on the other side of the basis space), and the interpolator crosses the origin to perform the interpolation. The right panel shows the same interpolation after implementing an orientation check, and the undesirable interpolation disappears.}\label{fig:flip-sign}

\hypertarget{conclusion}{%
\section{Conclusion}\label{conclusion}}

This paper has provided several visual diagnostics that can be used for
understanding a complex optimisation procedure and are implemented in
the \textbf{ferrn} package. The methods were illustrated using the
optimisers available for projection pursuit guided tour. Here the
constraint is the orthonormality condition of the projection bases,
which corresponds to optimisation over spheres and torii. The approach
described broadly applies to other constrained optimisers. Although the
manifold in \(p\)-space might be different the diagnostic techniques are
the same. A researcher would begin by saving the path of the optimiser
in a form required to input into the ferrn package, as described in this
paper. One might generally make more samples from the constrained space
upon which to assess and compare the optimisation paths. These
high-dimensional data objects can then be viewed using the tour.

The progressive optimisation of a target function and its coverage of
the search space can be viewed in both reduced 2D space and the full
space. These visualisations can lead to insights for evaluating and
comparing the performance of multiple optimisers operating on the same
task. They can provide a better understanding of existing methods or
motivate the development of new approaches. For example, we have
compared how three optimisers perform when maximising a non-smooth index
function and have illustrated how the pseudo-derivative search fails in
this setting. The observations from our experiments have also been
translated into improved optimisation methods for the guided tour, e.g.,
we introduced the option to interrupt the search if a better basis is
found along the path.

This work might be considered an effort to bring transparency into
algorithms. Although little attention is paid by algorithm developers to
providing ways to output information during intermediate steps, this is
an important component for enabling others to understand and diagnose
the performance. Algorithms are an essential component of artificial
intelligence that is used to make daily life easier. Interpretability of
algorithms is important to guard against aspects like bias and
inappropriate use. The data object underlying the visual diagnostics
here is an example of what might be useful in algorithm development
generally.
