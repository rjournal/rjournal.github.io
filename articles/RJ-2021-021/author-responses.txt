Thank you very much for your letter and the opportunity to revise our manuscript. 
The suggestions and insightful comments offered by the reviewer have been immensely
helpful. We have included the reviewer comments in the following and responded to 
them individually.

Thank you.

In fact, the test dataset has a considerable size with 5 layers, each with about
41.7 mil pixels and 11 LUC classes. We intended to include an example, which
allows possible users to have an idea of processing time in real world
applications for land use and cover change assessments. In our test runs on the
dataset, we obtained similar performances for both functions. Both functions
process the original raster layers using the R "raster" package. Thus, the
functions inherit performance characteristics of this package. For now, we have
not tested alternatives yet (e.g. use of a code written in a lower level
language). Test runs with simulated datasets with increasing grid size and class
number showed a linear increase in processing time and in none of our tests we
had problems with a memory overflow.

We included the following sentence at the end of the paragraph "Consistency
Check and Data Extraction from Raster Time Series": Users should be aware that
acc_changes() and contingencyTable() process the entire input time series
analyzing successive raster pairs. Processing time of contingencyTable(), the
computationally most demanding function of OpenLand may range between 3 and 7
minutes for the SaoLourencoBasin dataset if using common desktop computers (8 MB
Ram, i3-i7 processors, Windows 64bits versions). 


>	The sankeyLand functions appear to be commented out. 

Yes, thank you, we removed the quotes in the manuscript.


>	They produce html output, so this should be noted.

sankeyLand() was developed using the networD3 package, which generates html
output by default. The following sentence was added at the end of the item
"Miscellaneous Non-Spatial Visualization Tools": "The sankeyLand() function
returns html output, as it depends on the networkD3 R package which uses such
format as default".

Thank you very much for this alert. In the current version, all graphics are now
using colorblind-friendly colours. Therefore, we used the R package
“rcartocolo”, setting the respective parameter (colorblind_friendly = TRUE). All
respective figures in the manuscript have been substituted.


>	Apart from those issues, this is well-structured and clearly written.

Thank you very much.
