If you would like to report a problem with a published paper, whether it is your own or not, you can contact the current editor at r-journal@r-project.org, or create an issue on the Github site https://github.com/rjournal/rjournal.github.io. 

This is the same approach that can be used to make suggestions. 

If it is your own paper, and you know how to fix the problem, you would be welcome to make a pull request with the fix.

We are always in need of reviewers, and welcome you to add your name to the list of potential reviewers through [this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSf8EmpF85ASWqPHXqV0vdQd-GHhNBaAZZEYf4qxO3gTl-eGyA/viewform). Reviewers enhance the quality of the journal and help make the journal useful for the community.

If you are interested in becoming an Associate Editor, you should directly contact the current editor, along with a list of keywords that describe your expertise chosen from the list provided by `rjtools::keywords`. Associate editors handle 2-4 articles per month, managing obtaining reviews, and writing a summary of the reviews for the Editor. You should have at least an undergraduate degree (in any field) and be an active R user.
