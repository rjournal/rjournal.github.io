  abstract: '  Abstract Examining distributions of variables is the first step in
    the analysis of a clinical trial before            more specific modelling can
    begin. Reporting these results to stakeholders of the trial is an essential            part
    of a statistician’s work. The atable package facilitates these steps by offering
    easy-to-use but still            flexible functions.'

  bibauthor: Michael Kipp and Ursula Laa and Dianne Cook
  abstract: '  Abstract The tourr package in R has several algorithms and displays
    for showing multivariate data as            a sequence of low-dimensional projections.
    It can display as a movie but has no capacity for interaction,            such
    as stop/go, change tour type, drop/add variables. The tourrGui package provides
    these sorts            of controls, but the interface is programmed with the dated
    RGtk2 package. This work explores            using custom messages to pass data
    from R to D3 for viewing, using the Shiny framework. This is an            approach
    that can be generally used for creating all sorts of interactive graphics.'

    Optimization Routines for Enforcing One-to-One Matches in

  bibauthor: Diego Moretti and Luca Valentino and Tiziana Tuoto
  abstract: '  Abstract Record linkage aims at quickly and accurately identifying
    if two records represent the same            real world entity. In many applications,
    we are interested in restricting the linkage results to "1 to 1"            links,
    that is a single record does not appear more than once in the output. This can
    be dealt with the            transport algorithm. The optimization problem, however,
    grows quadratically in the size of the input,            quickly becoming untreatable
    for cases with a few thousand records. This paper compares different            solutions,
    provided by some R packages for linear programming solvers. The comparison is
    done            in terms of memory usage and execution time. The aim is to overcome
    the current implementation            in the toolkit RELAIS, specifically developed
    for record linkage problems. The results highlight            improvements beyond
    expectations. In fact the tested solutions allow successfully executing the "1
    to            1" reduction for large size datasets up to the largest sample surveys
    at National Statistical Institutes.'

  bibauthor: Charlotte Dion and Simone Hermann and Adeline Samson
  abstract: '  Abstract Stochastic differential equations (SDEs) are useful to model
    continuous stochastic processes.            When (independent) repeated temporal
    data are available, variability between the trajectories can be            modeled
    by introducing random effects in the drift of the SDEs. These models are useful
    to analyze            neuronal data, crack length data, pharmacokinetics, financial
    data, to cite some applications among            other. The R package focuses
    on the estimation of SDEs with linear random effects in the drift. The goal            is
    to estimate the common density of the random effects from repeated discrete observations
    of the            SDE. The package mixedsde proposes three estimation methods:
    a Bayesian parametric, a frequentist            parametric and a frequentist nonparametric
    method. The three procedures are described as well as the            main functions
    of the package. Illustrations are presented on simulated and real data.'

  abstract: '  Abstract Methods based on Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI)
    fingerprinting are in the            forefront among several techniques being
    proposed for indoor positioning. This paper introduces            the R package
    ipft, which provides algorithms and utility functions for indoor positioning using            fingerprinting
    techniques. These functions are designed for manipulation of RSSI fingerprint
    data            sets, estimation of positions, comparison of the performance of
    different positioning models, and            graphical visualization of data.
    Well-known machine learning algorithms are implemented in this            package
    to perform analysis and estimations over RSSI data sets. The paper provides a
    description            of these algorithms and functions, as well as examples
    of its use with real data. The ipft package            provides a base that we

    RobustGaSP: Robust Gaussian Stochastic Process Emulation in

  bibauthor: Mengyang Gu and Jesus Palomo and James O. Berger
  abstract: '  Abstract Gaussian stochastic process (GaSP) emulation is a powerful
    tool for approximating compu           tationally intensive computer models. However,
    estimation of parameters in the GaSP emulator is            a challenging task.
    No closed-form estimator is available and many numerical problems arise with            standard
    estimates, e.g., the maximum likelihood estimator. In this package, we implement
    a marginal            posterior mode estimator, for special priors and parameterizations.
    This estimation method that            meets the robust parameter estimation criteria
    was discussed in Gu et al. (2018); mathematical reasons            are provided
    therein to explain why robust parameter estimation can greatly improve predictive            performance
    of the emulator. In addition, inert inputs (inputs that almost have no effect
    on the            variability of a function) can be identified from the marginal
    posterior mode estimation at no extra            computational cost. The package
    also implements the parallel partial Gaussian stochastic process            (PP
    GaSP) emulator (Gu and Berger (2016)) for the scenario where the computer model
    has multiple            outputs on, for example, spatial-temporal coordinates.
    The package can be operated in a default mode,            but also allows numerous
    user specifications, such as the capability of specifying trend functions and            noise
    terms. Examples are studied herein to highlight the performance of the package
    in terms of            out-of-sample prediction.'

  abstract: Intensive longitudinal data in the behavioral sciences are often noisy,
    multivariate in nature, and may involve multiple units undergoing regime switches
    by showing discontinuities interspersed with continuous dynamics. Despite increasing
    interest in using linear and nonlinear            differential/difference equation
    models with regime switches, there has been a scarcity of software            packages
    that are fast and freely accessible. We have created an R package called dynr
    that can handle            a broad class of linear and nonlinear discreteand continuous-time
    models, with regime-switching            properties and linear Gaussian measurement
    functions, in C, while maintaining simple and easy-to           learn model specification
    functions in R. We present the mathematical and computational bases used            by
    the dynr R package, and present two illustrative examples to demonstrate the unique
    features of            dynr.

    qualitative/mixed data are provided together with an improved version of the so-called           Gustafson-Kessel
    algorithm to avoid singularity in the cluster covariance matrices. Finally, it

  abstract: '  Abstract Matching is a well known technique to balance covariates distribution
    between treated and            control units in non-experimental studies. In many
    fields, clustered data are a very common occurrence            in the analysis
    of observational data and the clustering can add potentially interesting information.            Matching
    algorithms should be adapted to properly exploit the hierarchical structure. In
    this article we            present the CMatching package implementing matching
    algorithms for clustered data. The package            provides functions for obtaining
    a matched dataset along with estimates of most common parameters            of
    interest and model-based standard errors. A propensity score matching analysis,
    relating math            proficiency with homework completion for students belonging
    to different schools (based on the            NELS-88 data), illustrates in detail
    the use of the algorithms.'

  abstract: '  Abstract Identification of informative variables in an information
    system is often performed using            simple one-dimensional filtering procedures
    that discard information about interactions between            variables. Such
    an approach may result in removing some relevant variables from consideration.
    Here            we present an R package MDFS (MultiDimensional Feature Selection)
    that performs identification            of informative variables taking into account
    synergistic interactions between multiple descriptors            and the decision
    variable. MDFS is an implementation of an algorithm based on information theory            (Mnich
    and Rudnicki, 2017). The computational kernel of the package is implemented in
    C++. A            high-performance version implemented in CUDA C is also available.
    The application of MDFS is            demonstrated using the well-known Madelon
    dataset, in which a decision variable is generated from            synergistic
    interactions between descriptor variables. It is shown that the application of

  bibauthor: Allison Fialkowski and Hemant Tiwari
  abstract: '  Abstract The SimCorrMix package generates correlated continuous (normal,
    non-normal, and mix           ture), binary, ordinal, and count (regular and zero-inflated,
    Poisson and Negative Binomial) variables            that mimic real-world data
    sets. Continuous variables are simulated using either Fleishman’s third           order
    or Headrick’s fifth-order power method transformation. Simulation occurs at the
    component            level for continuous mixture distributions, and the target
    correlation matrix is specified in terms of            correlations with components.
    However, the package contains functions to approximate expected            correlations
    with continuous mixture variables. There are two simulation pathways which calculate            intermediate
    correlations involving count variables differently, increasing accuracy under
    a wide range            of parameters. The package also provides functions to
    calculate cumulants of continuous mixture            distributions, check parameter
    inputs, calculate feasible correlation boundaries, and summarize and            plot
    simulated variables. SimCorrMix is an important addition to existing R simulation
    packages            because it is the first to include continuous mixture and
    zero-inflated count variables in correlated            data sets.'

  title: Time-Series Clustering in R Using the dtwclust Package
  bibtitle: Time-Series Clustering in R Using the dtwclust Package
  author: Alexis Sardá-Espinosa
  bibauthor: Alexis Sardá-Espinosa
  abstract: '  Abstract Most clustering strategies have not changed considerably since
    their initial definition. The            common improvements are either related
    to the distance measure used to assess dissimilarity, or            the function
    used to calculate prototypes. Time-series clustering is no exception, with the
    Dynamic            Time Warping distance being particularly popular in that context.
    This distance is computationally            expensive, so many related optimizations
    have been developed over the years. Since no single            clustering algorithm
    can be said to perform best on all datasets, different strategies must be tested
    and            compared, so a common infrastructure can be advantageous. In this

  abstract: '  Abstract This paper introduces the shadow package for R. The package
    provides functions for shadow           related calculations in the urban environment,
    namely shadow height, shadow footprint and Sky            View Factor (SVF) calculations,
    as well as a wrapper function to estimate solar radiation while taking            shadow
    effects into account. All functions operate on a layer of polygons with a height
    attribute,            also known as “extruded polygons” or 2.5D vector data. Such
    data are associated with accuracy            limitations in representing urban
    environments. However, unlike 3D models, polygonal layers of            building
    outlines along with their height are abundantly available and their processing
    does not            require specialized closed-source 3D software. The present
    package thus brings spatio-temporal            shadow, SVF and solar radiation
    calculation capabilities to the open-source spatial analysis workflow            in
    R. Package functionality is demonstrated using small reproducible examples for
    each function.            Wider potential use cases include urban environment
    applications such as evaluation of micro-climatic            influence for urban
    planning, studying urban climatic comfort and estimating photovoltaic energy            production
    potential.'

  bibauthor: Claudia Cava and Isabella Castiglioni
  abstract: '  Abstract High-throughput genomic technologies bring to light a comprehensive
    hallmark of molecular            changes of a disease. It is increasingly evident
    that genes are not isolated from each other and the            identification
    of a gene signature can only partially elucidate the de-regulated biological functions
    in a            disease. The comprehension of how groups of genes (pathways) are
    related to each other (pathway           cross talk) could explain biological
    mechanisms causing diseases. Biological pathways are important            tools
    to identify gene interactions and decrease the large number of genes to be studied
    by partitioning            them into smaller groups. Furthermore, recent scientific
    studies have demonstrated that an integration            of pathways and networks,
    instead of a single component of the pathway or a single network, could            lead
    to a deeper understanding of the pathology.                StarBioTrek is an R
    package for the integration of biological pathways and networks which            provides
    a series of functions to support the user in their analyses. In particular, it
    implements            algorithms to identify pathways cross-talk networks and
    gene network drivers in pathways. It is            available as open source and
    open development software in the Bioconductor platform.'

  bibauthor: Rheanna Mainzer and Paul Kabaila
  abstract: '  Abstract We have created the R package ciuupi to compute confidence
    intervals that utilize uncertain            prior information in linear regression.
    Unlike post-model-selection confidence intervals, the confidence            interval
    that utilizes uncertain prior information (CIUUPI) implemented in this package
    has, to an            excellent approximation, coverage probability throughout
    the parameter space that is very close to            the desired minimum coverage
    probability. Furthermore, when the uncertain prior information is            correct,
    the CIUUPI is, on average, shorter than the standard confidence interval constructed
    using            the full linear regression model. In this paper we provide motivating
    examples of scenarios where            the CIUUPI may be used. We then give a
    detailed description of this interval and the numerical            constrained
    optimization method implemented in R to obtain it. Lastly, using a real data set
    as an            illustrative example, we show how to use the functions in ciuupi.'

  abstract: '  Abstract It has been well documented that ignoring measurement error
    may result in severely biased            inference results. In recent years, there
    has been limited but increasing research on causal inference            with measurement
    error. In the presence of misclassified binary outcome variable, Shu and Yi (2017)            considered

    methods for situations where misclassification in the binary outcome variable            is
    a real concern, we implement correction methods proposed by Shu and Yi (2017)

  bibauthor: Juan Xiong and Grace Y. Yi
  abstract: '  Abstract Though longitudinal data often contain missing responses and
    error-prone covariates,            relatively little work has been available to
    simultaneously correct for the effects of response missingness            and
    covariate measurement error on analysis of longitudinal data. Yi (2008) proposed
    a simulation            based marginal method to adjust for the bias induced by
    measurement error in covariates as well            as by missingness in response.
    The proposed method focuses on modeling the marginal mean and            variance
    structures, and the missing at random mechanism is assumed. Furthermore, the distribution            of
    covariates are left unspecified. These features make the proposed method applicable
    to a broad            settings. In this paper, we develop an R package, called
    swgee, which implements the method            proposed by Yi (2008). Moreover,
    our package includes additional implementation steps which extend            the
    setting considered by Yi (2008). To describe the use of the package and its main
    features, we report            simulation studies and analyses of a data set arising
    from the Framingham Heart Study.'

  abstract: '  Abstract This paper presents a computational program named BINCOR (BINned
    CORrelation) for            estimating the correlation between two unevenly spaced
    time series. This program is also applicable to            the situation of two
    evenly spaced time series not on the same time grid. BINCOR is based on a novel            estimation
    approach proposed by Mudelsee (2010) for estimating the correlation between two
    climate            time series with different timescales. The idea is that autocorrelation
    (e.g. an AR1 process) means            that memory enables values obtained on
    different time points to be correlated. Binned correlation            is performed
    by resampling the time series under study into time bins on a regular grid, assigning            the
    mean values of the variable under scrutiny within those bins. We present two examples
    of our            BINCOR package with real data: instrumental and paleoclimatic
    time series. In both applications            BINCOR works properly in detecting
    well-established relationships between the climate records            compared.'

  abstract: '  Abstract A fixed point problem is one where we seek a vector, X, for
    a function, f, such that f(X) = X.            The solution of many such problems
    can be accelerated by using a fixed point acceleration algorithm.            With
    the release of the FixedPoint package there is now a number of algorithms available
    in R that can            be used for accelerating the finding of a fixed point
    of a function. These algorithms include Newton            acceleration, Aitken
    acceleration and Anderson acceleration as well as epsilon extrapolation methods            and
    minimal polynomial methods. This paper demonstrates the use of fixed point accelerators
    in            solving numerical mathematics problems using the algorithms of the
    FixedPoint package as well as            the squarem method of the SQUAREM package.'

    analysis of independent/clustered semi-competing risks data under the illness-death
    multi-state            model. The package allows the user to choose the specification

    regression models; parametric or non-parametric specifications for baseline survival

  abstract: '  Abstract Ranked set sampling (RSS) is an advanced data collection method
    when the exact mea           surement of an observation is difficult and/or expensive
    used in a number of research areas, e.g.,            environment, bioinformatics,
    ecology, etc. In this method, random sets are drawn from a population            and
    the units in sets are ranked with a ranking mechanism which is based on a visual
    inspection or a            concomitant variable. Because of the importance of
    working with a good design and easy analysis,            there is a need for a
    software tool which provides sampling designs and statistical inferences based            on
    RSS and its modifications. This paper introduces an R package as a free and easy-to-use
    analysis            tool for both sampling processes and statistical inferences
    based on RSS and its modified versions.            For researchers, the RSSampling
    package provides a sample with RSS, extreme RSS, median RSS,            percentile
    RSS, balanced groups RSS, double versions of RSS, L-RSS, truncation-based RSS,
    and robust            extreme RSS when the judgment rankings are both perfect
    and imperfect. Researchers can also use            this new package to make parametric
    inferences for the population mean and the variance where the            sample
    is obtained via classical RSS. Moreover, this package includes applications of
    the nonparametric            methods which are one sample sign test, Mann-Whitney-Wilcoxon
    test, and Wilcoxon signed-rank test            procedures. The package is available

  abstract: '  Abstract                The unival package is designed to help researchers
    decide between unidimensional and correlated           factors solutions in the
    factor analysis of psychometric measures. The novelty of the approach is its use            of
    external information, in which multiple factor scores and general factor scores
    are related to relevant            external variables or criteria. The unival
    package’s implementation comes from a series of procedures            put forward
    by Ferrando and Lorenzo-Seva (2019) and new methodological developments proposed            in
    this article. We assess models fitted using unival by means of a simulation study
    extending the            results obtained in the original proposal. Its usefulness
    is also assessed through a real-world data            example. Based on these
    results, we conclude unival is a valuable tool for use in applications in which            the
